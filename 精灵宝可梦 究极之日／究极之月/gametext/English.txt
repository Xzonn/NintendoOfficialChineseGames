1	Lesson 1: Picking up speed\n\nMantine will move forward on its own.\nRide up the face of the wave, and when you\nreach the lip, slide the Circle Pad to the left\nto surf back down and pick up speed!
2	Once you’re back down in the trough of the\nwave, slide the Circle Pad to the right to climb\nthe face again. Keep riding up and down the\nwave to pick up more and more speed!
3	Now it’s time for you to give it a try!\nTravel up and down the face of the wave by\nmoving the Circle Pad to the left and right, and\ntry to pick up some speed!
4	You’ve cleared Lesson 1!\n\nWhen Mantine starts moving really fast, you\nwill see the air currents around it turn orange!
5	[~ 5]
6	[~ 6]
7	[~ 7]
8	Lesson 2: Getting airborne\n\nWhen you reach the highest point of the wave,\nor the lip, slide the Circle Pad to the right and\nyou can launch into the air!
9	The faster Mantine is traveling, the higher\nyou’ll get off of the wave!
10	Now give it a try!\nPick up some speed, and then catch some air!
11	You’ve cleared Lesson 2!\n\nAnd remember: the height of a wave affects\nyour score for some moves, so choose the\nbest wave to leap to the air!
12	Lesson 3: Aerial moves\n\nWhile you’re in the air, move the Circle Pad in\nany direction to spin and twist.\nYou’ll add more points to your score if you do!
13	If you can chain together several of these spins\nduring the same aerial, you can pull off a bold\nmove that will earn you a high score!\nThe possible combinations are displayed on the\nlower screen.
14	It’s your turn now!\nTry to catch some air and pull off some\nawesome moves!
15	You’ve cleared Lesson 3!\n\nA sparkling ring appears around Mantine at the\nend of a trick. If you start another spin before\nit disappears, you’ll earn an even higher score!
16	Lesson 4: Landing\n\nWhen in the air, Mantine will slowly lose\nelevation and fall back down toward the\nwater surface.
17	If Mantine is still spinning when it hits the water,\nit will be swallowed by the wave and sink\nbelow the surface!\nMake sure you time your spins right so that\nthey end before you hit the water!
18	This is it!\nTry to land safely back on the water after\npulling off an aerial!
19	You’ve cleared Lesson 4!\n\nIf Mantine lands successfully, you will get a\nlanding bonus added to the points you had\nearned for any aerials you pulled off.\nThis way your score will keep going up!
20	You’ve cleared all the lessons!\nYou’re a full-fledged Mantine Surfer now!\n\nIf you want to repeat these lessons,\njust ask the Swimmer on the beach!
21	And one more thing!\nWhen you see an island on the horizon, you’ll\nknow you are close to your destination.\nTry to pull off moves until the very end of your\ntrip, and aim for a really high score!
22	Now, get out there and become a great\nMantine Surfer!

56	Nice line of sight!
57	That’s a good angle!
58	Think you could get a bit closer?
59	You’re just slamming that shutter, huh?
60	It’s super simple, and that’s great!

71	Looking at it from this angle isn’t bad either.
72	I guess it’s novel, anyway.

74	Side profile, huh? Well, aren’t you cool.

125	I like the overall feel of this one.
126	Try to focus better.
127	How about focusing next time? ¯\\_(´ー｀)_/¯
128	Isn’t it pretty blurry?

211	If you always feel your back’s against the wall\nwhen you battle, you’ll get results.
212	A sense of pressure is important for battling.
213	If you wanna form a duo with me, then we’re\naiming for the top!
214	It didn’t work out...\nThere wasn’t enough pressure...
215	All right!
216	Ooh! Yes!
217	Dang!
218	All right!
219	Dang!
220	Wa-hah-hah! Kneel before my Pokémon!
221	Whoa, you didn’t have to actually kneel! I just said that\nbecause I got excited.
222	Heh-heh! There you go! Well, I underrated you!
223	Wa-hah-hah! I can’t exactly pop right out when\ncalled, so I walked here.
224	Even though I did what I could, this is the result.\nEh, sometimes there are days like this.
225	Whoa! You’re my opponent! I’m a little stoked!
226	Oh! You OK? You’re barely breathing!
227	Oh! Your Pokémon are samurai! They’re super dangerous!

233	You called me for a blazing battle, right?
234	You worked up a sweat, too!\nC’mon, let’s head to the ocean!
235	Whether it’s fun or not is up to your Pokémon.
236	Well, it’s happy and fun times to win, but I feel bad for\nyour Pokémon.

247	Don’t get in the way of someone’s romance!
248	I don’t have the guts to fess up to the person\nI like, so I take refuge in battle.
249	When I lose in battle it feels like I’m about\nto get dumped.
250	Howdy! Are you a local?\nDo you understand what I’m saying?
251	Well! What an honor! You showed me such hospitality!
252	Coming at me out of the blue...\nThis is why it’s scary to go overseas...
253	Howdy! Are you a local?\nWhere do you feel like taking me?
254	First you force me out here, and then\nI get my butt kicked. This place is awful.
255	This is my first time coming to a place\nlike this, so please go easy on me.
256	Ha... How refreshing... Can we keep going?
257	H-hey! What’s up with this?! Are you ripping me off?!

290	My old lady laid down an ultimatum.\nShe said it was either her or my mop!
291	My old lady’s my old lady.\nMy mop is my mop.
292	My mop is way cuter than my nagging old lady.
293	Usually my mop or my old lady is my partner,\nbut I guess this time it’s you.
294	Anyway, you’re a lot better than my old lady.
295	Oh yeah, it’s great to skip out on work\nfor a battle.
296	Whatever you’re doing, it’s great to\nhide out and do it secretly.
297	If my boss finds out about this, first I’ll be fired,\nthen the wife will divorce me.

304	OK, that’s it for us this time!\nCall us again, partner!
305	It bothers me that young people these\ndays are totally lacking in perseverance.
306	So you’re another member of today’s youth.\nWhat’s it going to be like when I’m an old guy...
307	I heard the same thing when I was\nyoung, and it was pretty irritating.
308	Oh, a member of today’s youth...\nI ask you to be steady...
309	Because the kids these days...\nMe, too, I guess...
310	Nope! No way in the world am I just\ngonna idly slip into senility!

312	Not like this... No way I wanna get closer to dying...
313	Nope! No way I’m joining you!\nAnd anyway, I’ll hold you back!
314	Not like this... I hate good-byes...
315	Elders should be respected. You get that, right?
316	Be guided by children when you’re old? What hogwash!
317	...You’ve made enemies of the older generation around\nthe nation.

325	I used to be a Trainer who\nwas feared as a witch.
326	It’s impolite to call me a witch, since I’m so nice.
327	Gghh... This is unforgivable...\nI’m definitely gonna put a curse on you...

335	Before I die, allow me to go all out\nin a Pokémon battle once again!
336	Aah... The thrill of rushing about...\nI don’t want to die for a long while yet!

339	I’m burning from my loss!\nRejuvenation complete!
340	Just fighting, even if I’m reduced to ash.\nIn short, that’s my path.
341	Winning or losing is worthless. I find meaning in how I fought.
342	Being reduced to ash, yet still fighting\nas ash, is the way of the Trainer.
343	Our way of life is, namely, our way of death.\nYou will pay keen attention to this on our side.

354	Hey, caddy...I was a long way from the green...
355	Well, I couldn’t make it as a professional, so I’m\na lesson pro.

400	Caring for Pokémon from morning until night! It’s\ntough being a Breeder!
401	I wonder if there isn’t someone somewhere who will care\nfor me.
402	Just liking it isn’t enough to keep you going. In this job, you\ntake on life itself.
403	Oh! Are you gonna care for me?
404	Hey now! You just throw me away if we lose?!\nDoesn’t that seem just awful to you?!
405	I built up these muscles through work! You\nwanna check and see if it’s all for show?

416	Y’see, if you provide your service and sincerity for free,\nothers will take advantage of you.
417	Hey, hey, what about the tip! The tip! My livelihood depends\non that!
418	This time we’ll be partners, so you can relax\n’cause I don’t need a tip.
419	You’re really dedicated, aren’t you? You seem\ncut out for the service industry.

421	Just like me, my friends also strayed from the path here.
422	Just having something I can get so into that I go a little nuts\nmakes me happy.
423	I spend more time here than I do at home.
424	I see you around pretty often, too... Pretty soon \nthere will be no turning back for us.

429	No... For us to have been eaten up with\nsuch relish...
430	You’re young so eat up. Yeah, don’t be shy!

455	Since my grandfather’s generation, we’ve been\nPolicemen, but there aren’t any particular career\r\nopportunities in the field.
456	We begin as Policemen, and then it ends.
457	There are some Pokémon that can’t evolve. Their lives are\nalready determined when they come into the world.

459	Here, the journey ends.
460	Part of a justice squad! A Policeman has come!

477	M-my calculations were off?!
478	According to my data, with this duo...we’ve got\na 99 percent chance of victory.
479	Probabilities are probabilities... Just like\nunsteady people...
480	I’m jealous... You’re still a kid... I wish I could go\nback to that time...

500	Yeah, this is cosplay. I just wanted to be\nsomeone different.

519	I joined in the duo! I can’t believe this result!

521	It’s OK. Not everyone can be like me—someone who would \nput their life on the line for Pokémon.

523	I’m here. You’re here. We’ve got some leeway.

525	If you win, I’ll tell you my most treasured secret...
526	That’s really too bad, isn’t it? My secret will remain a secret.
527	My secret... It’s in my name...
528	It’s a secret even to my partner, the mystery\nI hide.
529	That was close... I’ll head home, bearing\nmy secret.
530	Whoa! You seem super strong! With all this\nexcitement, let’s go!
531	Whoa! That was seriously intense! I’m shaking from\nthe adrenaline!

533	Whoa! Haven’t seen you for a while! With all this\nexcitement, let’s go!
534	Whoa! I’m seriously out! I might pass out!
535	All right, let’s do this.
536	Yeah, good work.
537	Yep, you’re strong.
538	All right, let’s go.
539	OK, see ya.
540	Relax and leave it to me. I’ve got\nsome experience.
541	You learned something, right? Experience is important\nafter all!
542	My Pokémon and I were no match for you. You and your\nPokémon are more than you seem to be.
543	Leave it to me! I’ll show you something great!
544	I learned a lot! I won’t give up and I’ll\nkeep fighting!
545	There are two types of strength... The hard-\nworking type and the talented type.
546	Even if you work hard, you’re no match for my talent!
547	You’ve got talent and you work hard?!
548	You, the hardworking type, should just support\nme, the talented type.
549	Were we lacking in talent? Hard work? Or both?
550	Now I’m a scientist, but I used to be a doctor.
551	You must be willing to use moves if you want to understand\ntheir power.
552	As you might expect from someone who was a doctor,\nI’m not very good at hurting Pokémon.
553	Even if we lose, I’ll fix you up. I’m only partway\nthrough my research, though.
554	Good work, I’ll fix you up. I’ve got absolutely\nzero confidence that I can though.
555	If I had encountered Pokémon at an earlier point,\nmy life might’ve been much different.
556	While dealing almost wholly with machines, my heart froze up.
557	I’m tired of computers. I want a living companion.
558	If I had encountered you at an earlier point,\nmy life might’ve been much different.
559	Living companions are pretty great, aren’t they?
560	I love karate! Do you like karate?
561	I like Pokémon battles, too! But I like karate more!
562	I like karate! But I don’t like you!
563	I love karate! I’ll go at it with karate!
564	Oh... Didn’t do enough training...\nI’m gonna go do karate...
565	Mm!
566	Hm!
567	Nn!
568	Mm!
569	Rrr!
570	My hands are cramped and my feet are\nblistered, but still, I must dance.
571	I’ve got to work on my dancing skills to be the\nbest dancer.
572	Standing in front of people is a really daunting thing.
573	I can’t do too much, but I’ll at least cheer you on\nwith dance.
574	Was my dancing not good? I’ll dance well\nnext time.
575	If they watch me dancing, even Pokémon get\nreally excited!
576	Uh uh! Come on now! You can go a lot further!
577	You’re really pumped up, too! All right!\nAll-night dancing!
578	Let’s get pumped up and get at it!\nFollow my lead!
579	That wasn’t enough for me! Promise that you’ll\ncall me again!
580	Even I, an ordinary Collector, was able to join\nthe aces!
581	Heh... It’s tough, isn’t it...the ace title...
582	Alas! For me to be in this predicament, I bring dishonor to\nthe aces!
583	Leave it to me, Ace Trainer that I am!
584	Heh... We’re cowardly...you and I...
585	I shall break in this unknown junior Trainer.
586	Heh, heh... Maybe I’ll give you a candy after that whipping.
587	Hey there, that’s it, junior Trainer! Perhaps you want to\nbreak me in?
588	Unknown junior Trainer, I’ll form a tandem\nwith you!
589	The party ends here this time. Let’s get\ntogether again, junior Trainer!
590	Hunh... You... Somewhere, I’ve...
591	Huh... Who was that...?
592	I can’t remember... Even though I should know it...
593	Hunh... You again... Let’s see, you must be...
594	It’s no good... I can’t remember... Now, who were\nyou again...?
595	I must not forget my initial resolution! I’ll always\nhave that newcomer feeling!
596	Thanks! I’m grateful to you! I learned a lot!
597	Thanks! I’m grateful to you! Please treat me to\nsomething, mentor!
598	I must not forget my initial resolution! I’ll work on\nstaying fresh!
599	Thanks! Nice work! OK, that’s it for me!
600	Let’s not beat around the bush! I’m your\nopponent! Bring it on!
601	A Trainer who can’t win is worthless!\nLeave the ring...immediately!
602	Mercy is mockery of one’s opponent! Come on! Finish it!
603	Our mission is simple! Completely rout them all!
604	We didn’t achieve our goal! We’re disqualified as\nTrainers!
605	They’re my cherished friends, but don’t take it\neasy on them.
606	You were unlucky. With Pokémon, too, you have to wonder\nwhat they were born to do.
607	Making their friends fight is the calling of Trainers.
608	We must be prepared if we’re going to send our\ncherished friends into the ring.
609	Whether we win or lose, our Pokémon still get\nhurt. It makes you think, right?
610	You believe in them more than anything else...\nyour Pokémon...
611	You started to doubt your belief, didn’t you...\nThat’s why you lost.
612	Believing is good, isn’t it?
613	I believe...in you and your Pokémon...
614	Since this is the result of my believing in y’all, I\nhave no complaints about being in this state.
615	Here’s my scream! Oowhoaaaaa!
616	Here’s my scream! Yeah-gooooooood!
617	Here’s my scream! Guwhoaaaa!
618	Here’s my scream! Oowhoaaaaa!
619	It’s all over! Allllll riiiiiight!
620	I’m always able to mutter these feelings only\nafter I say good-bye.
621	This violent throbbing in my chest...\nyou must not be aware of it...
622	Bye-bye. Don’t look back... That back... I’ll never forget it.
623	Our meeting signals our parting. But we must\npress on.
624	This ceaseless, stirring refrain... I’ll still keep it\nto myself.
625	Oh, I get it, all right. You’re here for action, \nright? Fire it up! I’m so fired up!
626	I just barely won, but...this kid is something special...
627	Hey, what’s the story with you guys...?\nYour Pokémon are absolute monsters...
628	Oho! It’s you! This one’s fired up!
629	This kid’s definitely got a bright future! The\nfuture’s really something to look forward to!
630	With Pokémon I have long been living... With only\nPokémon I have long been living...
631	With only Pokémon I’ve been living, so that I’m strong\nis a given...
632	With only Pokémon I am living... My remaining years\nseem unforgiving...
633	With only Pokémon I am living...so human\ncompanionship I am missing...
634	This losing feeling sure is gloomy... I wanna go\nhome and get some snoozies...
635	I will not take you lightly. You better really\nbe ready.
636	Come now, can you even stand up? Your spirit and body\nhave been...
637	You are really impressive, Trainer... To have that kind of\nability is priceless...
638	The time has some for us to flaunt our abilities.
639	I am dissatisfied with the result, but we can\ndiscuss that some other time.
640	OK, my beloved Pokémon! Put the squeeze\non them!
641	That’s it, my Pokémon! The opponent is no longer at ease!
642	*squeeze*
643	OK, let’s put the squeeze on everyone!
644	*squeeze*
645	Being together, my Pokémon and I have no\nblind spots.
646	Really, you seem totally naive. What if you started over as\na baby?
647	It’s a fuzzy decision, but a loss... You absolutely reap what\nyou sow...
648	You and I as a pair...this will be an intense\ndevelopment.
649	What a sentimental battlefield... I’ll probably\npass out as soon as I get home.
650	I guess I’ll give it everything I’ve got so I have\nno regrets...
651	Hey, hey? You don’t have any regrets? Right? You’ve got no\nregrets, right?
652	I said I’d give it everything I had, but when you lose,\nyou have regrets.
653	Let’s give it everything we’ve got so we have no\nregrets with each other!
654	I gave it everything I had, but I have nothing\nbut regrets...
655	When you talk about the strongest, you’re\ntalking about me! I’m second to none!
656	There’s no way you can beat the strongest!\nI’m seriously amazing!
657	You beat me! Me, the strongest! How can I lose?!
658	When you talk about the strongest, you’re\ntalking about me! So just follow my lead!
659	There’s no way that the strongest could lose!\nIt must be your fault!
660	The pure and cute type is my everyday persona.
661	I can only be my true self in a place like this.
662	Creating a persona for life is comfortable but also\nconstraining, isn’t it?
663	Well, if you’re next to me, I can probably show\nmy true persona.
664	We lost, but that was still refreshing. Give me\nanother call sometime when you’re free.
665	Since when I was dumped by my boyfriend, I\nguess I’ve gotten stronger.
666	Even if I’m strong in battles, it’s meaningless if I’m\nnot popular.
667	Escapism is also more helpful than you’d think.
668	I’m gonna fight together with you? Well, I guess\nthat’s cool with me...
669	Like, when you’re next to me, I’m starting to\nfeel unpopular...
670	I wanna take over the world when I grow up.
671	You lost, so you can be my faithful servant.
672	If my dream comes true, there’s no way I’ll forgive you.
673	I’ll do my best together with you, my servant, so\nI can take over the world.
674	I’m going home! You go home, too, servant!
675	They call me a child prodigy, but that’s tough on\nme, since I’m still just a novice.
676	Just being naturally brilliant, it’s tough dealing with so\nmuch expectation.
677	It’s beyond annoying having to deal with the unfortunate\nexpectations of my parents and teachers.
678	I see that you’ve chosen me. Now we’ll see if I\ncan live up to expectations.
679	I’ve failed... I’ll apply myself, since I’m still\na novice.
680	My dad caught them for me. I dunno if\nthey’re strong.
681	Those Pokémon were strong. Thanks, Dad.
682	Those Pokémon were weak. My dad is dumb.
683	This time my dad caught strong Pokémon\nfor me.
684	They’re still weak. My dad is a stupid-head.
685	My mommy and daddy aren’t here, but I’m OK\nbecause of my Pokémon.
686	If all my Pokémon are around, every day is fun.
687	I’m gonna make my Pokémon a house when I get bigger.
688	My big brother and big sister aren’t here.\nThis is exciting.
689	Thanks, Traaaiiiner! You’re as cool as\nmy Pokémon!
690	I’ve found from taking constant journeys that\none’s life doesn’t change from those journeys.
691	Life does resemble a journey, but journeys are actually\njust journeys.
692	Life itself is a journey. Guess I’ve gotta get going somewhere.
693	Even though I haven’t figured out the point of\njourneys, for you to call wandering ol’ me...
694	It was just like we were on a journey together.\nThat’s what the battle was like. Thanks!
695	I’ve been constantly traveling for a number of\nyears, so there’s no region I don’t know about.
696	Hotels and the road are my home. I can go anywhere\nby myself.
697	I’d like there to be a dude around just for someone to simply\nsay “welcome home” to me.
698	I’ll show you the know-how I’ve developed from\ntraveling around the world.
699	...The barriers to battle are thicker than the\nbarriers of the world.
700	Sorry to keep you waiting. ♪ It’s time for the\nHiker to enter, who is an idol to some. ♪
701	I won’t let being in the minority get me down. ♪\nI gotta be me. ♪ And I am alive. ♪
702	I don’t need to be praised by others. ♪\nI can validate myself. ♪
703	Sorry to keep you waiting. ♪\nThe Hiker is here. ♪ Thanks for picking me. ♪
704	Sorry to bring you down... I’ll do better next time.\nSee you...
705	Finally, it’s my turn! I was totally sick of waiting!
706	After all that waiting, this is the result? You don’t have\nmuch guts, do you?
707	Pretty impressive that you were able to beat me! You’re\ngonna be big-time!
708	I was totally sick of waiting! You waited too long\nto call me!
709	Didn’t have enough guts... I should eat\nsomething that gives me stamina...
710	Can you get ahead by working hard? Seems like\nthat’s not the kind of era we’re in.
711	If I don’t do things halfheartedly enough, I look like a fool.\nYou would, too.
712	You’ve gotta preserve your personal life, or you’ll have no \ntime for romance, y’know?
713	Set a record by fighting intensely? That\nmight be appealing to the person I like...
714	This is nice because it’s fun. I don’t care about\nany records.
715	I was so busy with work that I neglected to care\nfor my Pokémon...
716	OK, time to head home and give them their due care.
717	See, they betray you if you don’t pay attention to them! The\nsame is true for people or Pokémon.
718	I haven’t been caring for them lately, so I \nwonder if my Pokémon will listen to me...
719	Yep, they just totally pouted. Don’t let that\nhappen to you...
720	What’s important at work is to be halfhearted,\nbut in a good way.
721	As long as I’m emotionally prepared, my victory is assured.
722	Not just working hard but managing things well is what\nmakes a grown-up. ♪
723	I’ll give ya some tricks for making it through\nsociety e-z!
724	If you lose and get irritated each time, you’ll\nlook silly. Watch out for that.
725	When I’m tired and go home, only Pokémon make\nme feel welcome in that dark room.
726	These little guys are my support. I can’t live without ’em.
727	I’m Pokémon dependent. But even so, it’s better than\nbeing alone.
728	I’m so dependent on Pokémon that I’m kinda\nawkward with people.
729	This battle was kind of a rehabilitation, I guess.
730	Ladies and gentlemen, step right up!\nI am rubbish!
731	It’s been 10-plus years since I was born saying, “goo goo\nga ga!” I walk the rubbish-filled highways!
732	I was born to rubbish and I adhere to rubbish! My scattered\nthoughts are due to rubbish!
733	Oh! Sorry to keep you waiting! This rubbish\nrushed here!
734	This rubbishy result is because of rubbish!\nIt’s no fault of yours!
735	I’ve got more than enough of every kind of\nbadness, but I don’t mess with Pokémon.
736	Messing with Pokémon stoops below even what brutes do.
737	For real though, I feel so bad for the Pokémon that I don’t\nlike battles.
738	...Oh, I guess you called me. Cool, let’s do this\nthen, I guess.
739	Why couldn’t we wreck those Trainers? If we\nhad, then our Pokémon wouldn’t have to suffer.
740	If you’ve got a goal, it’s no time to worry about\nhow you achieve it.
741	You might have to be cowardly, because it’s meaningless if\nyou can’t achieve results.
742	Heh heh heh. Those were some pretty underhanded\nmethods...but that’s what it is to be a Trainer.
743	I’m not picky about how I do it.\n’Cause I want results.
744	I’m still way too soft, too... I’ve gotta get way\nmore underhanded...
745	I was brought up with tender care, and I became\na fool with flying colors.
746	For you to lose to me, you must also be kind of—
747	I don’t hold any grudges toward anyone, but my foolishness\ncan’t be cured.
748	For you to pick this pathetic-looking fool... Could\nit be that we are birds of a feather?
749	This is what happens when you pick a fool, but\nyou were also pretty considerable.
750	Feels like it’s the bottom of the ninth! I’ve gotta\nget a hit. When will I get a hit?!
751	Aah... Can you hear them? The cheers of admiration for me...
752	I wonder if this will be my retirement...
753	I’ll show you how I can hit in this game! You’ll be\nmy coach!
754	C’mon, I said you were the coach... Now I’ll\nhave fewer highlights...
755	I’m announcing it right here! This battle!\nI’ve got it!
756	Hahaha! Just as I announced! A perfect victory for me!
757	I shouldn’t make any promises I can’t keep, like\nannouncements or declarations.
758	I’m announcing it right here! I’m your teammate!
759	It was just as I announced! Well, it was a\nperfect defeat!
760	I took up tennis for the sake of losing weight,\nbut I ended up—
761	Argh, I can’t lose weight. Just moving makes me eat.
762	Like, I keep putting on muscle, so I’m honestly a bit macho.
763	In tennis terms, we’re playing doubles.\nThat’s our relationship.
764	Your footwork is so light... What do you do\neach day...?
765	Look at that cute face... I’ll mess it up for you!
766	There ya go! Bend that cute face even more! There ya go!
767	When I see a cute kid, I can’t help but want to tease them.
768	All right! Let’s go mess up cute kids together!
769	Even when we lose, the fact that you’re stewing\nnext to me...I’m fine with that.
770	I just came here nonchalantly, without anyone\nexpecting anything of me.
771	But there may be meaning and value to carrying on.
772	My ability to continue ends here, and I guess I do, too.
773	I’m only capable of acting nonchalantly, so I\nhope that won’t bother you.
774	That’s the extent of my ability. I appreciate\nyour partnership.
775	The Pokémon I raised aren’t all like yours.
776	The battle begins from the stage of raising Pokémon.
777	That’s how my Pokémon are...\nYou’re a worthy connoisseur, too.
778	I’m OK with pitching in with the Pokémon\nI raised.
779	Those were pretty well raised, too. I couldn’t\nhelp but lose to them.
780	I’m OK with crying now as long as I’m able to\nhave the last laugh.
781	I’ll be able to rejoice much later. I’m aiming for\nsomething higher.
782	If I convert my frustration to hard work, I’ll surely\nget stronger.
783	Be with me now so we can have the last laugh.
784	Let’s remember this loss so we can aim\nhigher, together.
785	Rather than following an unlikely possibility, I’ve\ngot to know my limitations.
786	However hard I work, my limit is Rising Star.
787	I can’t trust people who speak of hopes and dreams.
788	Despite knowing my own limitations, I’ll try hard,\nso relax.
789	This is the limit for a Rising Star.\nSorry about that.
790	Hey, I bought souvenirs!\nI bought a ton of them!
791	I absolutely adore shopping! I’m a shopping fool!
792	Gotta buy! I’m gonna buy more right after this! I wanna buy so\nmuch stuff that the shop has to shut down!
793	Hey, I’ll battle! I’ll battle a ton for you!
794	I absolutely adore battles! I’m a battling fool!
795	I came on a bargain-priced tour, so the vacation\natmosphere is just about zero.
796	Buy cheap and you waste your money! That’s really well said.
797	Being here is my part-time job, and I’ve gotta make money or\nI’ll have no lodgings!
798	I’m here on a bargain-priced tour, so I can’t even\ngo to tourist spots.
799	The trailer towed by a bicycle hasn’t come to\nmeet me, so I’m not busy. Call me again, OK?
800	I’ve come here on my honeymoon to battle!\nI’m beyond saving!
801	My husband ran off a long time ago! But I’m having fun, so I’m\nOK with it!
802	It’s so fun that I can’t hold back! I guess I’m just a\nhopeless case!
803	My husband ran off since I’m always in battles,\nso I’ve been looking for my next partner.
804	I haven’t done enough battling by a long shot!\nDo you want to have another battle?!
805	Oh, I spent some money! I got totally into buying\neverything up!
806	I’m still gonna do a bunch more shopping! I won’t be able to\nbring it all home, but I’ll still buy it!
807	My trunk is stuffed with souvenirs! But I’m still gonna buy\nlike crazy!
808	Oh, I threw some Poké Balls! But I still wanna\nthrow more!
809	My arm is swollen from throwing so many\nPoké Balls! But I still wanna throw more!
810	I’m a clean freak, so the job I have now is\nmy calling.
811	The way I am, I can’t stand even a speck of dust, so my\nfamily suffers.
812	I scrub my Pokémon three times a day so they shine.
813	I’m a clean freak, so I demand cleanliness in\nmy partner.
814	One of our opponents was unclean, so\nI panicked.
815	I will judge whether you are unclean!
816	Uh-oh! You are unclean! I sentence you to\npunishment—cleaning!
817	Safe! You are pretty clean! But I sentence you to\npunishment—scrubbing!
818	Let’s you and I judge together whether the\nworld is clean!
819	Unfortunately, everyone is clean...\nThat’s really pretty boring...
820	Pokémon battles are popular at my work site, so\nit’s causing me trouble.
821	It’s OK if it’s just a momentary fad, but it’s really interfering\nwith work.
822	Even I, the foreman, am hooked. So frankly, we’re really\nbehind on the construction schedule.
823	I came because you called, even though I’m\nactually in the middle of work.
824	Well...result aside, I’m afraid to head back...
825	You risk your life being a Worker, but it’s\nplenty fulfilling.
826	I’m happy that I was able to boast of my work to you.
827	There’s a spirit of adventure to constructing buildings and\nbridges that last 100 years, isn’t there?
828	I’m by myself working away from home\nright now, so I’m glad you called.
829	Now I have a good yarn to tell to the kids in my\nhometown.
830	Palpitations, shortness of breath, dizziness, and\naged eyes... I’m like a department store full of\r\nchronic diseases.
831	“Old but still healthy” is like calling oneself a cyborg, if you\nask me.
832	Hospital? There’s no way I’ll go! I bet my character\nwould crumble.
833	I’ve got high blood pressure, thinning hair, and\nold-person odor, but leave this to me.
834	Since I’m always at my limit, I can’t really get any\nmore worn out now.
835	I’ve got money to burn and I’m quite popular: I’m\na winner.
836	Do I look happy? I’m actually not.
837	I’ve had bad luck only with Pokémon. The ones I have\nwith me now are borrowed.
838	While the Pokémon I have are borrowed, I got \nthem from a good place.
839	In the end, this might be the limit when it comes\nto another person’s Pokémon.
840	Aging gracefully takes a lot of behind the\nscenes work.
841	Through unseemly struggle, somehow I look the way I do now.
842	Don’t give me that look like, “I’m not interested in what this\nold lady has to say.”
843	Oh, I haven’t heard from you in a while. You \nmust want to hear what I have to say.
844	Don’t give me that look like, “It must be this old\nlady’s fault.”
845	Winners and losers arise from battle.
846	You can become stronger by understanding the frustration of\nthe loser.
847	Your expression is like, “I’m not interested in what this old\nperson has to say...”
848	Once again, we’re at the point where winners\nand losers arise from battle.
849	It seems like maybe you have an expression like,\n“It must be this old person’s fault...”
850	You smile with your face while you weep in your\nheart. That’s the service industry for ya.
851	The smile of the service industry is simply business.
852	The corpse of one’s tattered pride is the source of the\nbest hospitality.
853	I’m in the service industry, but I won’t flatter\nmy partner.
854	We provided service to the opponent. This, too,\nis the nature of the industry.
855	There are no Pokémon allowed at my hotel.
856	If the number of customers with no manners increases, you\nstart to feel constrained.
857	There are so many customers who just let their Pokémon do\nthis or that.
858	Let’s fight, while following the rules and\nmaintaining our manners.
859	We got too caught up in manners and left them\nan opening.
860	Since I got super into golf, I picked up the habit\nof doing practice swings.
861	I do practice swings even in my room, so my furniture gets all \nmessed up.
862	I have more fun doing practice swings than getting onto the\ncourse right now.
863	Since I got super into golf, Pokémon battles are\nkinda meh.
864	I think golf suits me better after all.
865	Point-blank, the hips are common to Pokémon\nbattles and golf!
866	There’s not enough swing in your hips! Twist more! Twist!
867	The swing in the hips decides the battle! All right, furiously\nswing with your hips!
868	I’m particular about motion in the hips! You\nbetter watch out!
869	It’s ’cause there wasn’t enough swing in our\nhips! We’ve gotta go at it more furiously!
870	Women have their weapons! Pokémon have\ntheir weapons!
871	You, too—you’ve gotta get your own particular weapon.
872	Is your weapon maybe your partnership with your Pokémon?
873	Those with their own weapons can\nseize victory.
874	You were honestly great. I was the weak link...
875	Rather than tedious words, we should speak\nwith our arms!
876	Don’t make fun of me for my slender arms. They are how I\nmake my living!
877	Is it seriously possible that I can’t hack it? Hey, what exactly\ndo you do?
878	We’ve got no time for tedious talk! Yeah! Let’s\nget fired up!
879	Our two-person combination... That’s an issue\nwe need to address...
880	Milk production is down this year, so my farm is\nin trouble.
881	I’ll have to go to town to work, or it’ll be tough to get by\nthis year.
882	In a business with living creatures as partners, it’s pretty\ntough to read the future.
883	Even though my farm is in trouble this year, I\nfound myself coming here.
884	Even though I know I need to go and work away\nfrom home, it’s so fun here that I don’t go.
885	Milk production is up this year, so it’s all smiles\nat my farm.
886	There’s certainly some risk in a business with living\ncreatures as partners.
887	I’ll be able to live a life of ease this year. Maybe I’ll even get a\nnew car.
888	It’s all smiles at my farm this year, so I’m able to\nspend my time at play.
889	If I live idly like this, next year’s figures will\nbe terrible.
890	Stop in and have a look at these\nextraordinary Pokémon!
891	Whaddya think? Great Pokémon, aren’t they? Why don’t you\nbuy one?
892	Whoa, hey! Don’t mess up the merchandise!
893	My extraordinary Pokémon! Let’s get down\nto business!
894	They’re not selling at all... What’s wrong\nwith them...?
895	C-come on! Quick! Bring it on!
896	Wh-what? I win sometimes!
897	O-OK! I gave it everything I had!
898	H-here we come! ’Cause we’re coming on fast!
899	Wh-what? That look! I gave it everything I had!
900	O-OK! Shall we let loose, splashily,\naround here?
901	Fiiiirrrre!
902	Ugh... Ughhhh... What happened?
903	O-OK! Shall you and I let it all loose?
904	Ughh... I’m fine... You go on ahead of me...
905	Ah, when was the last time...I met a Trainer\nlike you...?
906	That dreaming-of-the-future look... It’s tough for me just to\nlook at you...
907	I’m sure that you, too, will figure it out eventually...\nThe “future”—there’s nothing...
908	It’s a little tough for me to have to join up with a\nTrainer like you.
909	To not give up despite losing... That kind of look\nis hard for me to take...
910	You mean you don’t know about me?! I’m \nexperienced, so I hate dealing with newbies!
911	After this, have I been etched in your mind?
912	To lose to a little newbie... I myself feel like I have sunk...
913	You know about me, right? So relax!
914	To lose to that lot of newbies... We ourselves\nfeel like we have sunk...
915	Let’s just say that it’s rare for there to be a\nTrainer who can beat me.
916	See? Just like I told you! I’m pretty strong!
917	It had been a while since I’d lost! You’re pretty good!
918	If you’re a Trainer who’ll partner up with me, you\ngonna get pretty revved up out there?
919	You did pretty well! Call me again sometime!
920	You must be my opponent! OK! Come on with it!
921	Take it to heart! The true strength of a Collector!
922	Hoohaha! Not bad! I can accept you as my rival!
923	Hoohaha! My rival! Well then, onward!
924	Hoohaha! I’ve gotta stop! I look forward to\nnext time!
925	...Draw.
926	Heh...
927	Ack!
928	...Guess I’ll come.
929	Ack!
930	Feels like that ace label keeps dogging me...
931	Whew... With this, I was able to retain my ace label...
932	I’ve had it! This stupid ace thing! Even though I’d be fine\nwith being ordinary!
933	I’ve got the ace label! You’ve gotta help\nme out!
934	No! I wasn’t to blame! But then again, neither\nwere you!
935	I appreciate this!\n...Even though I’m off, it’s a regular customer...
936	That was really instructive!\n...I’ve seriously gotta try to be nice...
937	As expected, you’re quite strong!\n...This is just my business smile...
938	I appreciate this!\n...It’s that regular customer again...
939	I’m sorry, I wasn’t strong enough.\n...Well, I did what I could...
940	I’ve tried training in admiration of a hero I saw\nwhen I was a kid...
941	Ah... I’m really an incurable fool...
942	In reality, there’s no need for so-called heroes.
943	You resemble the hero I used to admire...
944	So-called heroes are really useless after all...
945	As long as my skin is elastic enough to make\nwater bead off, I’ll insist I’m a Beauty. ♪
946	Skin care after the battle! You better do it, too!
947	How to look like a Beauty... That’s my main issue in life...
948	Leave it to me, I who look exactly like a Beauty,\neven though I’m a Veteran. ♪
949	Oh no... These crow’s-feet... I’ve got to take care\nof them immediately...
950	...!
951	...!
952	...?

956	This is what I, Kanto’s top-level Trainer, can really do!
957	How did I lose? You really are the real deal!
958	[~ 958]
959	[~ 959]
960	The winner takes everything, and there’s\nnothing left for the loser.
961	If somebody wins, the person who fought against that person\nwill lose.
962	When one loses, they lose everything... The next thing I’ll look\nfor will be victory, too!
963	I’ll follow my role until I’m able to serve as\nyour partner.
964	I was unable to fulfill my role... All I can do is\ndeeply apologize...
965	Being here somehow makes me nostalgic...\nI remember those days...
966	That was fun... Thank you...
967	Your talent...it’s real.
968	Well, I have let up on my mission, so I’ll join up\nwith you.
969	The result aside, it was a good fight.
970	I trained in Hoenn to take on the world. Please\nhave a look at my results!
971	Let’s battle again sometime!
972	I’ve lost...
973	I hope you can bear with me, Champion!
974	...Still, don’t you count on us just losing to\nyou forever.
975	I’m glad! I’ll be able to bring out the power of\nPokémon by battling you!
976	I’ll file away info on this fighting style of yours!
977	Splendid! You are quite the Trainer!
978	The secret for bringing out the power of\nPokémon! I’ll learn it from you!
979	Seems like the wearable I’m so proud of wasn’t\nfunctioning well, right?
980	I, Cynthia, accept your challenge! There won’t\nbe any letup from me!
981	Even if you lose, never lose your love of Pokémon.
982	No matter how fun the battle is, it will always end sometime...
983	If I fight alongside you, I can learn everything\nabout you!
984	How frustrating! It ended before I could\nunderstand you and your Pokémon!
985	I don’t believe that people understand each\nother if they battle, but I’ll face you anyway.
986	I’ve got pride, too. I mean, I was in Team Skull.
987	Yeah, yeah, you win... You’re really a big deal!
988	I can’t believe I’m teaming up with you... I’m not\nsure why fate has brought us together, but\r\ndon’t let me down!
989	Aww, what’s wrong? Could it be that the\nChampion is not very good at the Battle Tree?
990	Doesn’t matter who I’m up against, I’m gonna\nbeat them down! That’s what big bad Guzma is\r\nall about!
991	Not yet! I could still keep wrecking! Come at me\nas many times as you want!
992	I guess that’s how it is, Champion! But I’m not beat down yet!
993	Heh, I like the looks of this! If it’s you and me,\nwe can beat anyone down!
994	Yeah, when it comes to you and me, we’re best\nat wrecking each other!
995	I’ll fully display the vaunted dancing of\nmy Pokémon!
996	Win or lose, there’s never enough dancing!
997	Win or lose, there’s never enough dancing!
998	If we are truly strong, surely we can win even if\nwe dance as we please!
999	Sorry! I need to keep practicing my dancing...
1000	Thanks for stopping by! Here’s today’s\nMallow Special!
1001	You taste defeat when you can’t draw out the\nexcellence of your Pokémon.
1002	Abilities must have been the secret ingredient!\nThere are many recipes for battle!
1003	With your Pokémon, I can produce a flavor\nthat no one can imagine!
1004	Now we’ve done it! We got greedy and mixed\ntogether a bunch of flavors, and it didn’t work!
1005	OK! Let’s get this show on the road!
1006	Tee hee! We didn’t act as masked heroes just for show.
1007	Brilliant and intense...you demonstrate a wonderful\nfighting style.
1008	Leave it to me, I who am always\nsupporting Dexio!
1009	I’m sorry... Maybe I can’t fight well in Multi\nBattles without Dexio.
1010	Then I’ll let my partners go wild!
1011	I’m glad I could show off the results of my training with Sina.
1012	Terrific! I hope you’ll put victory and defeat on the line\nagainst the Kalos Champion!
1013	Let’s show them our combination in which each\nof us lets the excellence of the other shine!
1014	Forgive me... Of course, if I were with Sina, we’d\nbe an invincible duo...

1022	OK! You’re pretty good!
1023	[~ 1023]
1024	[~ 1024]
1025	My Pokémon and I are gonna go all out! And\nthat’s how we’ll find the strongest move!
1026	Thanks, cousin! I sure do learn a lot from battling you!
1027	You got me! I saw your moves, yeah, and was\ncompletely mesmerized!
1028	I gotta believe in my beloved Pokémon, yeah, so\nwe can smack you with the strongest moves!
1029	You hit me with some nice moves! But next time\nit’ll be my team’s turn!
1030	[~ 1030]

1	Huh! You’re kinda strong, aren’t you?
2	If you see a Pokémon Trainer, you’ve gotta show\noff the Pokémon you like!
3	Hey, let’s battle!
4	Oh, right!
5	I just really like Pokémon, so win or lose,\nI’m happy.
6	I heard something good happens if you battle \nanother Trainer!
7	Hey, losing isn’t something good!
8	I guess the something good was that I got to \nmeet you through the battle!
9	Hey, Pokémon Trainers always seem to be \npeople who like Pokémon, right?\r\nIsn’t that strange?
10	I got it!\nYou must love Pokémon, too!
11	Even if a Pokémon doesn’t like you,\nif you tell it that you like it every day,\r\nit will grow to love you!
12	When you stay up at night, don’t you\nget sleepy?
13	I’m not getting enough sleep!
14	There are Pokémon that can sleep and recharge\neven while battling!
15	Hoooo-wah!
16	Hoooo-wah!
17	Hoooo-wah!
18	What? It’s already over?!
19	What? It’s already over?!
20	What? It’s already over?!
21	Aww, man!\nI wanted to show off my Pokémon’s best side more!
22	Aww, man!\nI wanted to show off my Pokémon’s best side more!
23	Aww, man!\nI wanted to show off my Pokémon’s best side more!
24	Sensational!
25	To think that you’ve wounded my pride,\nwhich is harder than diamonds!
26	[~ 26]
27	[~ 27]
28	Yo, I’m feelin’ mad annoyed that my team just got destroyed.
29	For real?!
30	Don’t worry—I’ll heal any pain that was caused by our defeat!
31	No! The Grimer I found in the tall grass near the school\nwas defeated?!
32	Whoa! Well played!
33	Metapod...here, have a Berry.
34	Go for it, Caterpie! Show me the power of\nBug-type Pokémon!
35	I lost with my Bug-type Pokémon! You’re really bugging me,\nyou know?
36	Bug-type Pokémon become powerful quickly!\nI’m gonna do my best to raise ’em!
37	Let’s go!\nKneecaps!
38	Aww...\nBrought to my knees.

43	Hey! Please battle me!
44	If you’re strong, please go away!
45	Great Trainers can sense promise in\nother Trainers!\r\nDid you pick up on anything?
46	Alola! Whaddya think?\nI’m pretty good at greetings, huh?\r\nI’m also great at Pokémon battles!
47	Oh! No!
48	The awesomeness of your Pokémon!\nYou should take on the world!
49	I’m looking for Berries to have my\nPokémon hold!
50	Oh! If only I had given Rockruff a Berry to hold...
51	Berries lie at the base of trees.\nAfter all, that’s why they are Berries!
52	Each Pokémon possesses an Ability.\c\nUnderstanding these well leads to victory!
53	I couldn’t show off the effects of Abilities?!
54	There are many kinds of Pokémon Abilities—\c\nsome that produce effects in battle, and some\nthat produce effects at other times!
55	I’ll draw out the power of my partner,\nGrowlithe, by giving it an item to hold!
56	Being a Trainer, I myself should also have\nused an item!
57	The item you want a Pokémon to hold will\nchange depending on how you want it to fight!
58	Do you have preferences about the type of\nmoves in addition to the type of Pokémon?
59	More preferences, please!
60	There is a type for moves, just like there is\na type for Pokémon.\c\nWhen the move type is the same as\nthe Pokémon type, it’s more powerful!
61	Oh! You look comfortable on your Pokémon!
62	Oh! You look comfortable with your Pokémon!
63	While it’s also good to ride Pokémon,\nI like swimming with Pokémon.
64	Life came from the sea!
65	I want to dive into the sea!\nI’m so ashamed that I want to dive!
66	Youngsters evolve into Swimmers.\nJust kidding!
67	All right! Come battle a lady!
68	Argh!\nYou’re way too strong!
69	Pokémon seem happy when they get to fully \nunleash a move!
70	The swaying makes my heart sway, too...\nOh yeah, let me introduce my Pokémon.
71	That move, this move...\nI’m so confused...
72	When I float with my Pokémon between the \nwaves, my heart dissolves into the world...
73	My favorite bikini makes Pokémon happy, too!
74	It’s tough fetching Poké Balls from my bikini!
75	My favorite bikini makes Pokémon happy, too!
76	Wearing that getup seems too hot!\nHave a good sweat in a battle!
77	My Pokémon and I are in a cold sweat from losing...
78	In Alola, it’s totally normal to wear a bikini\nfrom morning ’til night!
79	When I come to the Pokémon cemetery...\nit’s no good because I get so mournful.
80	I...I’ll try to hold back my tears.
81	He’s still alive in my heart...\nMaybe that is enough.
82	I’ll use the moves it was so good at!
83	Pikachu...
84	The grave where Pikachu rests...\nI address it using its words.
85	My Murkrow just loves shiny, sparkly things!
86	Murkrow! You must shine brighter!
87	Pokémon and Trainers with a good bond always\nseem to be shining brightly!
88	Is it cool for me to be in Team Skull if I’m this brittle?

99	Yes! You have emerged victorious!
100	I’d like to help out as a Trial Guide.\nBut I don’t wanna give you an easy win!
101	I crammed Pokémon in my backpack,\nbounced around, and now I’m here!
102	Whoa, looks like I’ve been visited by defeat!
103	I’ve been traveling everywhere, too, so I totally\nget how fun the island challenges must seem!
104	I am a Fisherman.\nIn short, I’m a person who fishes for Pokémon!
105	I can’t stand being caught!
106	A person who fishes can be called an angler\nor a Fisherman.
107	[~ 107]
108	[~ 108]
109	[~ 109]
110	Fishing is a path...\c\nIt’s a battle to win against oneself\nin addition to the Pokémon.
111	Even if I can win against myself, it looks like I’ve\nlost to you!
112	I calmly wait for the “!” to appear, no\nmatter how much fuss the Pokémon puts up!
113	When the fishing line has been cast,\na sucker may come along wanting to battle...\r\nEr, a Trainer will be hooked!
114	Maybe I, myself, became the sucker?
115	Having a fishing rod is fun because it allows\nyou to meet both Pokémon and Trainers!
116	The keeper of Ten Carat Hill!\nIt’s refreshing to be overcome!
117	I’ll teach you some tricks that guarantee\nhooking some Pokémon!
118	I’m not sure I need to teach you any\nfishing tricks.
119	If you don’t give up until you catch something,\nyou’ll definitely catch a Pokémon.\c\nIn Pokémon battles as well, if you battle\nuntil you win, you’ll definitely win.
120	I am a Collector.\nWhich is to say that I collect Pokémon.
121	Gimme gimme!
122	Collectors are happy beings.\c\nEven if there are no Pokémon we want,\njust our imagination can make us smile.

129	I rely on apps for traveling recommendations!
130	I guess I still haven’t mastered the recommended Rattata.
131	It’s a mystery as to whose recommendation it is,\nbut Pikachu Valley is apparently really nice.
132	I think you need to train your Pokémon.
133	How wonderful!
134	You should speak up in advance when\nthere’s nothing a Beauty could teach you.
135	When you speak of the Youngster Anthony, I’m\nthe only one in the Alola region!
136	You beat me, the only one like me in Alola,\nso you’re great!
137	When I think about it, you, too, are all alone in\nthe world.\r\nHold on a sec... How great is that!

141	I’m a Breeder!\nI raise and breed Pokémon!

143	I’m a Breeder!\nI recommend the Pokémon Nursery!

147	Pokémon and Trainer join forces to make a team.
148	Ah! I’ll swim, too...\nEr, I want to compete together!
149	I want to win a swimming relay, not as Trainer\nand Pokémon but as members of the same team.
150	Welcome to my mini-island.
151	I-I lost.\nBecause I won’t budge!
152	Well, I guess you can stay\nhere too on my mini-island.
153	Swimming is full-body exercise!\nIt’s toned muscle tactics!
154	Toned muscle flexes spontaneously.
155	Muscle is important for Pokémon, too!\c\nIt’s the muscles, not the brain, that decide\nwhich move to use in battle!
156	Oh come onnn...\c\nI wonder where I can go to spend time alone\nwith my Pokémon.
157	You’re actually not a bother.\nThanks for a little excitement.
158	Pokémon that don’t say anything\nare perfect for me right now...
159	Alola Trainers have a different charm than those in Kalos!
160	New encounters help people and Pokémon grow\nand mature!
161	Nice! How’d you come up with that kind of battle plan?\nYou gotta tell me!
162	Nice! How’d you come up with that kind of battle plan?\nYou gotta tell me!
163	Nice! How’d you come up with that kind of battle plan?\nYou gotta tell me!
164	How annoying!
165	Bone-dry!
166	I was unprepared! Perhaps I did not put\nenough emotion into the dance.
167	Wr-wr-wr-wrecked!
168	Maybe I should be more selfish since\nit’s a Battle Royal!
169	It was well fought and I lost fair and square, yeah.\nThat was excellent. I feel great. Woo!
170	There was so much to think about that I got all mixed up...\nbut that was a blast!
171	There was so much to think about that I got all mixed up...\nbut that was a blast!
172	There was so much to think about that I got all mixed up...\nbut that was a blast!
173	Hmph...\nSo I failed to keep things under control again?
174	My emotions...\nI guess I was unable to convey them.
175	[~ 175]
176	Yo, yo, you...you’re no joke.
177	Phooey.
178	How lovely.
179	One plus one is two, but it could also be three\nor four.
180	I’m too young for math!
181	There are some Trainers who will challenge you\nas a pair, like us.
182	You’ve got just one Pokémon?\nAt that count, we can’t fight.
183	There’s no way we’ll lose!\nIt’s important to feel strong!
184	A loss and a loss make a double loss!
185	The tears we cry when we lose make\nus stronger.
186	You’ve got just one Pokémon?\nThen sorry, we can’t battle.
187	If it’s all right with you, battle with us!
188	Oh my gosh!
189	We admire Dexio and Sina, the great\nduo from the Kalos region!
190	You’ve gotta have two Pokémon to battle\nwith us as a duo!
191	Combos that can’t be used alone can be\nused when there are two of us!
192	Combos are so difficult.\nBut that’s why they’re fun!
193	Those mysterious people, Sina and Dexio,\nare solving all sorts of cases!
194	This is a 2-on-2 Pokémon battle!\nYou don’t have enough healthy Pokémon.
195	Battles are the best for raising Pokémon!
196	Even if Pokémon lose...it’s OK as long as the Trainer\ngrows from that.
197	Trainers also grow through raising Pokémon.
198	[~ 198]

201	One of the duties of a Breeder is to discover\nand refine the strengths of Pokémon.
202	I wanna know what my strengths are!
203	The more you learn about Pokémon, the more\nfascinating they become!
204	Alola! I’m Caleb. Let’s give each other a look at\nour Pokémon!
205	Your Pokémon—so cool!
206	I don’t mind Youngster, but I wanna be called\nthat boy in shorts!
207	[~ 207]

210	Here I go!
211	It’s over!
212	Nothing!
213	So!\nWhat do you think of the largeness of my area?!
214	Whoa! A large-scale Trainer!
215	In my case, my volume is large in addition to\nmy area!
216	I was losing constantly, so I’m on a trip\nto find myself.
217	I think about why I lost, but I don’t dwell on it!
218	Even if you dwell on your losses, tomorrow\nis a new day!
219	Attacking from a high place to a low place is as\neasy as chopping down bamboo.
220	I guess I wasn’t able to make full use of\nthe potential energy from being in a high place.
221	The Ability No Guard ensures that all attacks\nwill hit!\r\nYeah, even against Pokémon using Fly!
222	Trainer detected!\nI will now commence the attack!
223	An honorable defeat!\nI lost, but it was invigorating!
224	I had climbed to a high place...\nI was hoping for a way to get down.\c\nSo my thanks to you!
225	Research! Research!\nI shall research the Pokémon!
226	I present the results of my research!\nThis person’s Pokémon—strong!
227	A further research topic is how to defeat\nstrong Pokémon.
228	The sea and beach are so nice.\nJust being here broadens my mind!
229	Me as I am now, I can tolerate losing.
230	Battling for enjoyment without worrying\nabout winning or losing is also nice.
231	Hee hee... Wanna help\nme pass the time?
232	Nuh-uh!
233	Maybe you’re a little too stoked?
234	Good wind! Good waves!\nAbove all, my good mood!
235	I guess my Pokémon weren’t in such a good mood...
236	You can catch the flow if your Pokémon\nuse moves while in a good mood!
237	Can you tell me how you chose your\npartner Pokémon?
238	I have trouble deciding on my partners,\nbecause there are so many criteria.
239	Traveling along the surface of the water on a\nRide Pokémon feels great, doesn’t it?
240	The best thing about Swimmers?\c\nThere is nothing for us other than Pokémon!\nWe represent freedom.
241	I’m empty-handed, but I do have the prize money\nto pay you.
242	A place to put away Poké Balls?\nThat’s the mystery of Swimmers, isn’t it?
243	I’ll attack you boldly in my bold bikini!
244	Left watered-down at the waterfront!
245	Bikinis and Pokémon battles are\ntotally unrelated.
246	Which Pokémon do you think is fitting with the\ngrave? Let’s battle. Perhaps you’ll figure it out.
247	Is it Ghost type after all?\nI’m also looking for something that’s unexpected.
248	The graves in Akala have been here\na long time...\r\nThat’s why this is a tourist spot.
249	I thought I’d have a little gander at the\nRuins of Life.\r\nBut there’s one thing to do first!
250	Quite skillfully done!
251	Tapu Lele visits the Ruins of Life...\nIt’s considered to be the vitalizing Pokémon.
252	Punk Girl sounds scary, doesn’t it?\c\nPlease be friendly and call me Punky.
253	You’re...the calm, cool, and collected type, aren’t you?
254	With these flashy looks but polite expressions,\nI deceive and confuse my opponents.
255	People in graves are sleeping forever, right?
256	Aah... I’m getting sleepy!
257	If they’re sleeping and won’t wake up, just give\nthem a Chesto Berry to hold.
258	Good morning!\nMornin’ for short!
259	You played that battle well!\nGG for short!
260	Thanks for being my opponent!\nTY for short!
261	I fish when I think I can catch something.\nI battle when I think I can win.
262	Would’ve been nice if I could’ve won just by thinking\nI could win.
263	I fish when I think I can catch something.\nI fish when I believe I can catch something.\r\nThey are similar but different.
264	Work through brute force doesn’t go well!
265	Your power is beyond what I imagined!
266	Doing calculations allows you to tap into\nyour power!
267	Dig a hole!
268	If there was a hole here, I’d wanna crawl into it!\nI wanna dig a hole and hide!
269	Dig a hole! If I dug it, I’d wanna fill it up.\nMy soul cries out at me to do that!
270	Whether in battles or in digging tunnels,\nPokémon are incredible!
271	The same is true for my Pokémon, but your\nPokémon—incredible!
272	This was originally a path dug by Diglett.\c\nDiglett let us use it as well, so we maintain\nit out of gratitude!
273	Eat well, sleep well...then it’s time for a\nproper battle!
274	I’ve had enough!\nI can’t fight anymore.
275	A Trainer’s Pokémon don’t grow if they are\nleft alone.\c\nAlthough when I eat meals, I naturally\ngrow horizontally.
276	Are you raising Pokémon?
277	Maybe, in addition to providing care, raising means\ndrawing out talents?
278	I’ve built up the lower body of my Pokémon\nthrough the undulations on the ranch!\c\nI guess what I need to use most is myself...
279	All right! Trial-goer, have a look at my kid.
280	You’re growing rapidly.\nThat’s wonderful!
281	Trainer and Pokémon are like parent and child!\nJust seeing them cheerful makes you happy!
282	Look at the lustrous heads of my Pokémon!
283	My Pokémon are cute, even when they lose!
284	I can’t help petting the heads of my Pokémon!\c\nIt seems there are even Pokémon that\nwill high-five you if you hold up your hand!
285	I keep repeating fair battles with Pokémon\nand Trainers.\r\nWhat kind of person is a Fisherman...?
286	Joy when I hook it...\nSadness when it gets away...
287	Life bobs up and down...\nI think while watching the bobber...\c\nI could catch rare Pokémon from rock\npiles with bubbles spouting from them...
288	You’re a fool if you dance...\nand a fool if you just look on!
289	My stomach is crying and saying “urgent”!
290	My stomach is crying and saying “urgent”!
291	It’s fine with me.\nI’ve grown tired of eating rich meals.
292	It’s fine with me.\nI’ve grown tired of eating rich meals.
293	Argh, the humiliation...\nWell, eat heartily, at least.
294	Argh, the humiliation...\nWell, eat heartily, at least.
295	That was a filling appetizer.
296	That was a filling appetizer.
297	What a shame! The delicious-looking\nfood will all be nourishment just for you.
298	What a shame! The delicious-looking\nfood will all be nourishment just for you.
299	Me! I’ll go back to being an ordinary Breeder!
300	Me! I’ll go back to being an ordinary Breeder!
301	Argh! First I take a loss, and then I get called by my company!
302	Argh! First I take a loss, and then I get called by my company!

319	Bwah!!\nI had my breath held that whole battle!
320	Bwah!!\nI had my breath held that whole battle!
321	Bwah!!\nI had my breath held that whole battle!
322	Hey, yo! When I fight, I’m not supposed to lose!
323	I don’t know if you care, but that bus stop weighs about\nas much as Golem!
324	You’re with Kukui...\nLooks like he brought along a good Trainer.
325	I see.\nGreat work...I guess.
326	You, you!
327	Hmmph! I can’t even stand myself right now!
328	If attacking from the front doesn’t work, what about\nfrom the rear... I’ve got a lot to think about!
329	A lookout has to be strong for when the time comes!
330	You’re on a whole other level than me.\nI’ve just got to laugh at myself...
331	Ack! The island challenge has made you way too strong!
332	Yeah, yeah.\nI gotta admit, that was great!
333	Hmph... How annoying.
334	Hmph...
335	[~ 335]
336	Aiyee!
337	Hmm...It seems as though I may have lost.
338	I haven’t done enough development work on\nPokémon battles!
339	You really do just win, don’t you?\nHonesty seems like the way to go.
340	It’s not a particularly original line, but wherever there\nis light, there is also shadow.
341	There is another world that cannot be brought\nabout through idle talk... Got it?
342	That was—! No way!\nBut I totally had to win this one!
343	That was—! No way!\nBut I totally had to win this one!
344	That was—! No way!\nBut I totally had to win this one!
345	I gotta keep the boss from getting his hands\ndirty, so I’m gonna wreck you myself!
346	Wasn’t me who got crushed! It was my\nPokémon, right? You think so, too, right?
347	The boss is not gonna be happy about this...\c\nI wish he would punish my Pokémon instead\nof me!
348	Aiyee!
349	Here’s an impression for you: Aiyee!
350	Hmph... That’s Faba for you.
351	This is for the sponsor who supports\nTeam Skull!
352	All our strength comes from the money we’ve gotten...
353	I’ll do anything if you pay me for it!\c\nLike, let’s see... Wanna see me get hit with\nHyper Beam?
354	Hey, what’s up with you?\nHow come I can’t smash you?!
355	How...how can you be so awful!
356	Ow, that hurts! Even my heart hurts!
357	Our 500 percent is, like, what\npercentage of your strength?!
358	Thud! That’s the sound of your\nstrength rocking me to my core!
359	Aaauuuggghhhhhhhhh!!!
360	Hmph.\nThere’s nothing more to say.
361	I could feel the power you gained\non your journey through Alola.
362	Really lovely...both you and your Pokémon...
363	I’m...I’m speechless! You’ve done me in!
364	It’s frustrating to me as a member of the Elite Four,\nbut it seems your strength is the real deal.
365	I couldn’t win even though I went all out...\nBut what a refreshing feeling. Woo!

374	Oh my gosh! I’ve gotta go see\nKiawe’s fiery dance with Pokémon!
375	If it’s a mountain, I’ve gotta climb it!\nThat’s the spirit of the Hiker!
376	There are some mountains I can’t climb...\nI’m talking about you and your Pokémon!
377	I’ve gotta first climb down the mountain.\nI’m off to be able to climb the next one...
378	Allow me to show you the ace Kadabra of an\nAce Trainer!
379	Aah!\nI blacked out!
380	I want to make my Kadabra evolve! Friends...\nI need friends!
381	Whee-ooh, whee-ooh!\c\nMy impression of a siren is pretty good, eh?\nI’m pretty good at Pokémon battles, too.
382	You’re something else! You’re better\nat Pokémon battles than I am!
383	I want to put a siren on Tauros and\nmake it exclusive to Police Officers.
384	I know so much about rare Pokémon!
385	You see...rare Pokémon are too special to be used\nfor fighting...
386	Shiny Pokémon are too special to be\nshown off...
387	Were you bothered by this Beauty\nstrolling along? Or by my Pokémon?
388	You bother me!

402	Pokémon battles are life.\nYou’re bashing our way of life!
403	The joy of victory...the agony of defeat...that’s life.
404	Whether I win or lose, my life will go on.\nI’m not gonna mope around forever.
405	It’s important for Pokémon to be cute\nand strong!
406	It’s possible to lose when you’re cute\nand strong? What’s up with that?
407	We just need to get cuter and stronger!
408	Moves with high accuracy.\nMoves with high power...\r\nHey! Allow me to experiment!
409	You’ve got to be able to read your opponent’s\nthoughts in addition to the statistics of a move!
410	Do you know Professor Kukui?\c\nHe’s building up his body to take the full impact\nof Pokémon moves so he can check their power.

421	All right, everybody...back inside your Poké Balls...
422	Ah, it’s so nice out!
423	Looks like you’ve got a fishing rod made\nby Lana!
424	If I only had a fishing rod made\nby Lana, I could win, too!

431	I can’t compete with the swimming speed of\nSharpedo and Poliwrath!
432	Abs! Abs!
433	My Frillish and I were distracted by our surroundings...
434	If you go on a date at the beach, you can see\nyour girl’s swimsuit...\c\nThat’s what I was thinking, but my girl’s been\ntraining the whole time.
435	You’ve got just one Pokémon? That will\nmake it too tough for you to fight with us.
436	When I get in the ocean, I get pricked by\nCorsola or Pyukumuku!
437	Argh! It’s ’cause Frillish is just so adorable!
438	Pokémon stick to me just like Shellder biting\ndown on Slowbro’s tail...
439	You’ve gotta have two Pokémon if you wanna\nbattle us!
440	You’re gonna fully experience my\nWater-based tactics!
441	Bubble, bubble, bubble...\nI sink and I dive...
442	My swim trunks are out of respect\nfor Machamp!
443	Hee-hee, I’m not a mermaid.\nI’m a Pokémon Trainer in a bikini!
444	Oh! Stormy!

450	Even if you work seriously, you won’t always get results!
451	Hmph! Since you’re serious...lemme give you a\ntip, yo.\c\nYo, yo, ya don’t stop.\nEven if you lose, ya don’t stop!
452	I’m a grand Grunt.\nThe Pokémon Carnivine is my fave.
453	Yep, I lost. I got crushed.
454	I’m a grand Grunt. Carnivine is my fave, but I\ndon’t have one.
455	No one has lost today. What a lovely, good day!
456	Aww, I lost... What a terrible, bad day...
457	Who can I take out the sadness of this loss on?\nAnyway, sadness for me and Team Skull.
458	Hunh? Everything around here seems like a\nTeam Skull paradise.
459	I might really go to paradise now that I’ve lost!
460	Aaah! I wish I had taken the island challenge\nmore seriously!
461	Surrounded by flowers...\nI’m...gorgeous...
462	Ahh! The flower I am has fallen.
463	Flowers and young women...\nour impermanence makes us gorgeous...
464	Do you know about super, strong Pokémon?
465	I said “super,” but I meant\nsomething a little different.
466	The fluffy ones are really the super Pokémon!
467	Today is Pokémon day!
468	I’m fine ’cause I’m with Cleffa.
469	If I’m in a tough spot, Cleffa sends me to\nmy house.
470	All right! Time for a commemorative photo!\nJust need you to lose for me, ’K?
471	What did I say...\nWhat...did I say...
472	I got overexcited by my journey!\nI should just go to the Alola Photo Club if I want\r\ncommemorative photos, right?
473	When I’m traveling, I just want to\npoint out everything!
474	I disclosed everything...\neverything about my Pokémon!
475	I always get a little down when I get home.\nMaybe I can travel forever?
476	Listen up, Trainer.\nBattle is a Hiker’s favorite.
477	Listen up, Trainer.\nA Hiker hates to lose.
478	Listen up, Trainer.\c\nA Hiker’s most favorite are big and\ntough Pokémon!\r\nAnd next is a big helping of rice!
479	By battling a Collector, you’ll be able to obtain\ninfo on rare Pokémon!
480	You got me! I’ll tell you my treasured info.
481	I’m craning my neck, waiting to see if\nMeteorite Pokémon will fall.\r\nYeah, just like Turtonator!

494	I’m an incomplete Grunt.\nThis is the only place for me in the whole world!
495	This is a fitting outcome for me, incomplete as\nI am—the end!
496	The boss is a complete bully, but I’m an\nincomplete Grunt.\c\nSometimes I want to smash the world,\nbut I’m always afraid of it.
497	I’ll stop you so Guzma will stay chill!
498	This is terrible, yo... The mansion is gonna get\nwrecked again!
499	Guzma... Even though he’s so strong, he wasn’t\nable to become a captain!
500	An uninvited guest... Do you have an invitation?
501	I guess that attack was your alternative to an invitation!
502	No! I wish I had never come here! Probably\nbecause three passwords are needed instead\r\nof an invitation. And I lost the memos with\r\nthe passwords somewhere in the mansion!
503	So sorry! As a stranger, you get a full course of\nmy Pokémon’s moves!
504	Your full course...it’s got way too much seasoning!
505	I always make sweet pancakes or sweet Berry\ncakes, yo.
506	Hey! So you think peeking in people’s rooms is\nin good taste?!
507	At least your Pokémon have good taste...
508	What does it mean to say “in good taste”?\nIs it like saying it’s cosmopolitan? Is there such\r\na thing as a cosmopolitan Pokémon?
509	Ooh, looking for a battle in a romantic\nspot, hmm?
510	I guess nobody likes Team Skull after all...
511	Even this dreamy balcony is\nsurrounded by the town, so it’s boring.\c\nYo, check it! Surrounded by surroundings,\nit’s so astounding!\c\nIck! Never mind, that was terrible!
512	One, two, hit THREE sandbag.\nFour, five, we’re ra-SIX-cals.
513	After 10 seconds, the bell rings, and it’s a knockout, baby!
514	It’s a pain to go all the way to the Pokémon\nCenter, so I just sleep next to my Pokémon!
515	I’m just as good as the woman next to me!
516	I was just as good as the woman next to me, right?\nRight?
517	We’re twins, so we’re always being compared.\c\nSo I’m sure you get my wanting to be just as\ngood as her.
518	Oh? You don’t have two Pokémon?\nIn that case, we can’t take you on.
519	I stack up to the one next to me!
520	I’m stronger than the one next to me, right?\nRight?
521	We’re twins and she’s the big sister,\nso we’re always compared.\r\nSo I’m sure you get my wanting to win.
522	Oh? You don’t have two Pokémon?\nIn that case, we can’t take you on.

530	What a super-rowdy Trainer!
531	Fomantis, Mareanie...\nThey’re not mean—they just want to cuddle...

538	I offer up my dancing in appreciation\nfor receiving Berries.
539	I forgot to dance for victory...
540	Long ago, it seems that people related to the\nTapu through dance.
541	We’re going to show you two Pokémon. It’d be\nunfair if you didn’t show us two, as well!
542	Let’s have a quick battle while gathering\nBerries together with our Pokémon!
543	Really, pardon me...
544	Berries keep for a long time.\c\nFor we who travel the seas, they’re the\nperfect ingredient.
545	Rare Trainer discovered!\nI must immediately make contact!
546	Do you have a sense for why you\nseem rare?
547	You weren’t born in Alola.\nFor some reason, that’s what I think.
548	Does this area seem like a power spot\nto you?
549	Aah! My Pokémon didn’t get infused with power!
550	The Pokémon enshrined at the Ruins...\napparently they purify our impurities.
551	Ready, set, go!
552	Game, set!
553	Congratulations!
554	My Pokémon is tough as nails!
555	I’m deflated.\nI’ve lost all heart...
556	Mienshao is angry!\nIt will reforge my lost heart!
557	I’ve completed trials and grand trials;\nnow I aim for an even higher place!
558	Were the trials you completed more densely packed\nthan the ones I did?
559	I’m literally searching for a high place!\nI’m actually gonna go climb a tree.
560	Both me and my Pokémon were born in\nthe mountains!
561	Conflicts produce nothing, but from Pokémon battles springs\na sense of mutual respect.
562	If a Hiker like me springs from the mountains,\nSwimmers could well spring from a wellspring!
563	I was a Rising Star who spent all my time in\nbattle, and now I’m a Veteran!
564	I say I’m a Veteran, but the path of Pokémon runs steep!
565	If you keep cherishing your Pokémon,\nyou can become a Veteran, too!
566	I’m not just an ordinary Sightseer!
567	Whoa! I’ve discovered a cluster of talent\nin the Alola region!
568	I’m a Sightseer battling to get stronger\nin the battle facilities of each region!
569	Surely you are able to battle with two\nPokémon at the same time, aren’t you?
570	We want even stronger rivals!\nMy Pokémon and I both cry out for that!
571	Thank you for showing the strength I was looking for!\nI’m glad I came to Alola!
572	That’s right... Battle Towers—and their like in\ndistant regions—are the facilities I favor!
573	I came all the way to Alola, so I want you to\nshow me two Pokémon!
574	I know a lot about Pokémon...\nI can use my knowledge in battle!
575	You know a lot about Pokémon.\nAmazingly, even more than I do!
576	Completion of the Pokédex is\nthe basis of Pokémon research!\c\nYou should collect a ton of Pokémon\nwith Rotom!
577	What are Pokémon?\nDo you know?
578	Why was I unable to win?\nThank you for giving me an assignment!
579	What are Pokémon?\c\nEveryone will have a different answer, but\nyou can figure it out by thinking about it.
580	I’m a self-seeking Backpacker!\nI savor each day as it comes.\r\nI guess today will be a battle with you!
581	This is the taste of defeat...\nPerhaps it’s delicious to savor!
582	It’s good to be a Backpacker!\c\nYou get to decide on your own all the\nthings you do and don’t want to do!
583	I battle every day.\nThere’s no one who can match me in that!
584	Darn! It’s my fault that my Pokémon lose\nso often.
585	We’re so strong because of marital disputes!\nAhaha!
586	You want to fight us!\nYou’ve gotta have two Pokémon.
587	Ohoho! We battle 50 times a day.
588	The shame from losing will rejuvenate me!
589	You might say that I raised\nmy husband’s Pokémon!
590	You want to fight with us, right?\nThen you’ve gotta have two Pokémon.
591	To be the strongest is an unfulfilled dream...\nbut you must press on to get closer to it!
592	Whoa! Training!\nI haven’t done enough training!
593	Even after the island challenge, I still want\nto strengthen myself!\c\nTrainers and Pokémon who feel that way\ngather at the Battle Tree!
594	To form a battery, my Pokémon and I battle\nconstantly while synchronizing our breathing.
595	Whoa... You’re legit!
596	Talonflame is the pitcher and I’m\nthe catcher!\c\nYou may wonder how it throws, but let’s\nnot talk of it!
597	Let’s have a party.\nA rough-and-tumble Pokémon party!
598	Your attacks were effective!\nI felt them all the way to my heart!
599	The party is over!\nLet’s have a party to celebrate that!
600	I’mma get fired up, naturally!
601	I got fired up and lost, unfortunately!
602	It’s the fighting spirit, yo, the fighting spirit!\nZ-Power is fighting spirit, too, right?
603	We’re aiming for the top, so be prepared for us\nto go all out!
604	You guys are the tops!\nI felt the strength in your heart!
605	If you’re aiming for the top, you’ve got\nto test yourself against top opponents!\c\nThe world is simple like that!
606	A strong Trainer can tell the strength of\nhis or her opponent at a glance!
607	What amazing Pokémon!\nTruly, I must admit my defeat!
608	I like Pokémon so much, it actually pains me...\nSo I let all of them shine in battle.
609	[~ 609]
610	[~ 610]
611	[~ 611]
612	The way you guys trust each other!\nI want to see it all!
613	Nicely done! I dig it—Pokémon and Trainers who trust\neach other.
614	You can demonstrate your full strength\nby trusting each other!
615	The altar is just a little farther, so I can’t\nlet you pass easily.\r\nShow me everything you’ve got!
616	Whoa, you’ve got a lot...\nI have no choice but to admit defeat!
617	Go where you please!\c\nIf you and your Pokémon give it everything\nyou’ve got, there’s no place you can’t reach!
618	Trainers and Pokémon should be\nfree! Freedom is good!
619	Good stuff!\nBe as free as you can be!
620	We can’t decide what Pokémon are like!\nThey are free!
621	Do trial-goers come all the way out here?\nWhat’s the deal with the kids in Alola?
622	Alola is great!\nYou and your Pokémon are great!
623	Ah! There are still so many undiscovered\nPokémon in the world!\c\nWhen you finish the island challenge,\nyou should travel the world!
624	The most dangerous spot in Alola.\c\nAllow me to test whether you can\nget past the Vast Poni Canyon!
625	Excellent! You guys should be able to reach\nthe altar!
626	The Altar of Alola concentrates the power of\nthe stars...\r\nThat’s what they say.
627	You need two Pokémon that can battle!\nThat’s our request to you.
628	Show me how serious you and your\nPokémon are!
629	Wonderful! You and your Pokémon should absolutely\nhead to the altar!
630	The Altar of Alola is a vessel that\ncollects light...\r\nThat’s what they say.
631	You need two Pokémon that can battle!\nThat’s our request to you.
632	If you climb mountains, there’s so much\nyou need to know about them—the Pokémon\r\nthat live there and the Trainers you’ll meet!
633	I went to the top! And you’re the tops!\nThat’s pretty similar!
634	Totem Pokémon seem to guard the favorite\nplaces of the Tapu—the guardian deities.
635	I like Pokémon!\c\nI like battling!\c\nI like using moves!\c\nAnd I love winning!
636	I lost! But my Pokémon that lost are adorable!
637	I hate losing!\c\nBut falling to the bottom and then struggling\nto climb back up, I can’t get enough of that!
638	I’ll win! That’s all there is to it.
639	I lost! That’s all there was to it...\nWell, you guys are terrific.
640	The hearts of the Pokémon\nand Trainer overlap...\r\nThey seek only victory!\c\nI want to reach that kind of mental state.
641	Anywhere for the sake of research!\nJust like my idol—Professor Birch.
642	The skills of Pokémon are needed\nwhen examining places here and there.
643	If you know Pokémon, you may be able\nto travel here and there without battling.
644	I confined myself to this cave to seek\nthe secrets of battle.\c\nIf it’s all right with you, please\nbattle my beloved Pokémon!
645	Attacking and defending, I guess it’s all\nup to oneself.
646	Adjusting to one’s opponent...\nMaintaining oneself...\c\nBoth are wonderful! What’s important\nis whether something is fitting to oneself.
647	My outward face is that of a Backpacker.\nWhat about my inward face...?
648	You guys are strong, so I could not steal\na glorious victory.
649	I’m a treasure hunter looking for treasure!\c\nHave a whiff of this whole area.\nYou can smell the aroma of treasure!
650	In this case, I’ll ask you!\nWhat do you think a mountain is?
651	What strength!\nJust like a mountain!
652	A mountain is a concept!\nSomething you must overcome is a mountain!
653	Intruder spotted! I’ll fight with all I have to wipe\nyou out!
654	What does this mean? What does this mean!
655	You may think yourselves strong,\nbut Aether Paradise is huge!
656	I’ll crush you to find out what you’re made of!\nI bet it’s a bunch of stuff, including money!
657	Oh! Prize money!
658	There are people with many different faces at\nAether Paradise.
659	I wanna go back in time and tell myself to not battle you.
660	It’s not bad to lose! It’s bad to win against me!
661	I lost, I lost! I’ll give you the money I have!
662	You don’t have to ring the bell.\nIf our eyes meet, I’ll come.
663	Having to hand over my pocket\nmoney rather than getting a tip...
664	Recently, there have been cases of Pokémon\nstaying by themselves...
665	The first step to surpassing Captain\nMallow is to strengthen my Pokémon!
666	I lost!\nLet me have another!
667	Mallow’s food is special.\nIt grips your heart.
668	Alola, alola! Welcome, Trainer!
669	Hula, hula!
670	A lot of people come by holding Eggs,\nso cheer them on with dance!
671	I’m training together with the genius\nnext to me in order to beat him!
672	Master! Sorry...
673	If you’re strong, be just!\nI bow my head to my young partner!
674	If you only have one Pokémon that can fight,\nplease come back later.
675	I was born a karate genius!\nI teach moves to my Pokémon.
676	I keep a smile even when my Pokémon and I lose!\nIt reassures my Pokémon.
677	Hmm... I’ve got to further devote myself\nto my karate!
678	If you only have one Pokémon that\ncan fight, I must ask you to leave.
679	When it comes to golf or Pokémon, it’s all about\nthe performance.
680	What a miss...\nMy performance was absolutely terrible.
681	Just getting the ball in the hole...\nit’s fun because it’s so difficult!
682	The swing is all in the hips!\nI’ll put my hips into it when I take you on!
683	Even if I can triumph over myself in golf, when it\ncomes to triumphing over my opponent in a match...
684	Natu’s always jumping around, chasing after my\ngolf balls!
685	I haven’t had any cases, so I’m bored...\nHow about a battle?
686	This is a case!\n...Or not.
687	It’s OK for a Police Officer to be weak\nbecause Alola is peaceful!
688	Clean, clean! The fighting style of Janitors\nis also clean!
689	Spotless!
690	The Pokémon move Recycle allows you to use\nan item you have already used!
691	[~ 691]
692	[~ 692]
693	[~ 693]
694	Just like flexible bamboo, I’ll evade your attacks!
695	I messed up my evasion!\nYou and your Pokémon are way too awesome.
696	Just like flexible bamboo, I also evade work!
697	Are you aware of the awesomeness of being\nbarefoot over the geothermally warmed ground?
698	Barefoot! The soles of my feet are hot!
699	It gets pretty warm if you’re barefoot\nover the geothermally warmed ground!
700	Welcome to the secret beach!\nLet’s have a battle to get acquainted!
701	Good work, good work.\nHere’s my pocket money!
702	My pocket money...never mind how I fetch it.\c\nAnd never mind about items washing ashore\nevery day.
703	C’mere! Let’s do something\ngood with our Pokémon.
704	Hey! The fun ends immediately if you’re too strong.
705	Items wash up on Ula’ula Beach...\c\nIt’s more fun to think of them as the\nhandiwork of Pokémon rather than the tide’s.
706	I want rare Pokémon!\nI’ll go anywhere due to my tenacity.
707	You’d be surprised how little I fixate on victory.
708	My nature as a Collector gives me trouble.\c\nI can’t travel to other islands until I’ve\ncompleted the Ula’ula Island Pokédex.
709	I’m doing research on the island challenge.\nI ask for your cooperation!
710	Despite taking damage, I was able to gather data!
711	Trainers on the island challenge are strong!\nMy research is conclusive!
712	Argh! I can’t help but want to\nbattle when a Trainer is present!
713	Argh! No way I’d lose if this were about dancing.
714	Floette celebrates every beautiful flower garden\nit sees with a dance! I wish I could be like that.
715	I was watching the parabolic antenna,\nand I found a Trainer!
716	Wha-wha-wha-what!
717	I wonder if Pokémon can see microwaves\ntransmitted between parabolic antennae.
718	[~ 718]
719	[~ 719]
720	[~ 720]
721	I feel sorry for the Pokémon who have to be\nused by an intruder!
722	Hmph! Although you’re an intruder, you seem to have\na lot of skill!
723	Is it because you guys arrived? Paradise seems\nso showy!
724	I must fight to reassure the Pokémon\nin paradise!
725	That was regrettable... I guess it really is a must\nto have power!
726	What I heard was that we are to be on the\nlookout for people trying to steal Pokémon.
727	I was told to turn away Trainers, whomever they\nmight be!
728	Hey! You’re so strong that there’s\nno way I can turn you away!
729	That Faba... He doesn’t even try to fight\nby himself!
730	I sensed the strength that you possess as Champion.
731	Since you’ve become Champion, both you and\nyour Pokémon have a certain level of polish.
732	I’m...I’m speechless!\nHow did you do it again?!
733	This feeling of frustration that is swelling within me...\nI will use it to propel my growth!
734	It’s hard to be strong enough to admit that you’re\nweak...you know?
735	Battling against strong Trainers’ll make you stronger, too.\nSlowly but surely!
736	Battling against strong Trainers’ll make you stronger, too.\nSlowly but surely!
737	Battling against strong Trainers’ll make you stronger, too.\nSlowly but surely!
738	I am training to properly form my desire for victory.
739	All I have to do is avoid making any more mistakes...\nAfter all, I have Silvally with me.
740	Th-this child has—!
741	If you want to see a rainbow, you’ve got to wait for it to\nstop raining.
742	Yes, yes...
743	You provide a dazzling battle.
744	There’s no need for two suns in the sky.
745	...While there are times when there’s a full moon,\nthere are also times you can’t see the moon at all.
746	Intense battle is a lot for my old body to bear...
747	Summer ice is much sought after, but no one even\nglances at winter ice. 
748	I couldn’t skillfully do what I learned from my grandma!
749	The bitterness of defeat...I must fully savor that as well.
750	Yes! It seems that you are once more victorious!
751	Luvdisc!
752	Corsola!
753	Well! You certainly reeled me in.
754	Sure enough, when it comes to you and Pokémon,\nthe quality of the ingredients shines forth!
755	...I can’t beat you if I keep my troubles to myself.

761	[~ 761]
762	Congratulations! You cleared a little trial!
763	Congratulations! You cleared a little trial!
764	Z-comparison complete...
765	I’m the kahuna of Route 12...\nbut I guess I still get defeated sometimes.
766	The waves recede!
767	Blown away by the waterfall!
768	Oh, so it’s like that?
769	The mystery is too deep!
770	Indeed...
771	Hmph. Looks like you got me.
772	[~ 772]
773	[~ 773]
774	I was exercising to aid digestion, but you came at me full-on!
775	Father...that was my best shot!
776	What is the meaning of this?!
777	[~ 777]
778	[~ 778]
779	D-d-ding!
780	I’ll eventually be the strongest, and it’ll be awesome...\nNah.
781	It’s hard to be strong enough to admit that you’re weak...\nyou know?
782	It’s hard to be strong enough to admit that you’re weak...\nyou know?
783	It’s hard to be strong enough to admit that you’re weak...\nyou know?

791	...!
792	You’re a pretty big deal!\nAmazing that I could lose!
793	I lost! Will I repeat the year?\nWill I have to repeat another year?!
794	W-wow, you’re something else!
795	Golden!
796	Ahh, refreshing!

802	All I have to do is avoid making any more mistakes...\nAfter all, I have Silvally with me.
803	The ridiculous power at the scene of a fire!
804	I lost. I was extinguished!
805	My surprise when Remoraid evolved into\nOctillery! The world is full of wonder!
806	I’m confident in the training I’ve done\nwith my Pokémon! Check it out!
807	Ahh! Did I not use enough Pokémon Refresh?\nDid I not use enough?
808	Practice is practice!\nIn the end, you need the will to win.
809	If you really wanna see what we can do,\nyou’ve gotta have two healthy Pokémon!
810	Testing out the results of one’s training\nis of the utmost importance!
811	It’s frustrating to lose in red rover!
812	You’ve got to go all out in training, too! ’Cause\nthe tension is totally different in a real game.

817	Me an’ Dedenne aren’t messing around!
818	What?! But it’s so nuzzle-able!
819	Whoever yer against, “not messing\naround” means recognizing yer opponent.
820	Faith moves mountains!
821	My hopes were crushed!
822	Is faith needed to speed up one’s techniques?
823	A weak Trainer blames losses on his or\nher Pokémon!
824	No way! It’s cool with me, bad dude that I am,\nso let’s go again!
825	I’m a Punk Guy! I’d be a punk to give up!
826	Hey! There’s no way you can battle against us\nwith just one Pokémon.
827	The weather in Alola is too nice, so\nyou get why I wanna get rowdy, right?
828	Sooo bad!
829	Don’t call me a Punk Girl.\nThat makes it sound like I’m a bad kid!
830	Hey! We can’t battle you if you’ve got just\none Pokémon.
831	I’m an Office Worker!\nOr you could say I’m a business guy!
832	Hm? Are my partners business Pokémon?
833	I want to do business with Pokémon.\c\nFor example, I could use the pincers of\nCrabrawler, which grow back constantly.
834	Here comes a Trainer, lured by\nflower nectar.
835	An Office Worker standing in a meadow.\nThat could be a painting...
836	Torkoal’s Flame Wheel sends Jumpluff flying\nbeyond what the eye can see...
837	I’d go anywhere to be extreme!\nCheck out how us bad dudes do it.
838	Hmph! Ya may be strong, but there’s nothing good or\nbad about ya!
839	I’ve gotta praise an opponent who has taken\ntheir favorite fighting style to the extreme!
840	I wanna beat you down!\nCome back with two healthy Pokémon.
841	All I can do is get psyched against an opponent\nI can’t beat, even after I’ve trained myself up!
842	I can’t do anything through my psyched ’tude.\nBut I’ve gotta look cool!
843	Even if I know I can’t win, I can’t show my uncool\nside to my battling Pokémon, so I psych\r\nmyself up.
844	I wanna get psyched up!\nJust show me two healthy Pokémon.
845	[~ 845]
846	My stomach is infinite!\nThat’s irrelevant to the strength of my Pokémon!
847	[~ 847]
848	[~ 848]
849	My stomach is infinite!\nThat’s irrelevant to the strength of my Pokémon!
850	[~ 850]
851	[~ 851]
852	I... When I lose, I get disheartened and then I get hungry again.
853	[~ 853]
854	[~ 854]
855	I... When I lose, I get disheartened and then I get hungry again.
856	[~ 856]
857	Whoa! I’m shocked at your strength!
858	Winning even after your Attack stat is lowered...\nAn indomitable spirit, indeed!
859	The Pokémon and Trainer’s feelings\nare stacked together...\r\nTry receiving the unleashed Z-Power!
860	The highness of caliber to triumph\nwhile reacting to the feelings of your opponent!
861	If Pokémon and Trainer boost each other up,\nthe Z-Power unleashed will grow stronger, too!
862	Also known as the move department store!\c\n...I say that, but Pokémon can only remember\nfour moves at the same time.
863	Granbull! Sharpedo! Ampharos!
864	Pokémon that can learn many different moves\ncan, by doing so, deceive the opposing Trainer!
865	This is a battle that I’m not gonna lose!
866	This is a battle that I’m not gonna lose!
867	This is a battle that I’m not gonna lose!
868	Can you live on ideals alone?\nCan you get by on just high-sounding talk?
869	You guys are dazzling...horribly sparkling...
870	While competing with Team Skull to\nconserve Pokémon...\r\nsome people become steeped in evil.
871	Adults face many complex circumstances, right?\nChildren shouldn’t meddle in their affairs.
872	The children of Alola who aim to be champion through\nthe island challenge—they are not to be underestimated!
873	You all—you’re a good combination.\nDon’t betray your friends!
874	OK, seriously this time!\nThis is a battle that I am not gonna lose!
875	OK, seriously this time!\nThis is a battle that I am not gonna lose!
876	OK, seriously this time!\nThis is a battle that I am not gonna lose!
877	I’ll crush you, meddler with the Pokémon that\nwere being protected by those serious guys!\r\nThat’s the best entertainment!
878	Ehh... Guess it’s back to honest Pokémon conservation\nactivities for me.
879	People in the Alola region treat Pokémon well,\nbut it’s better to make Pokémon fight!
880	Where there is light, there is shadow! But that’s\nnot it. Light generates shadow!
881	Losing to you...generated dark feelings in me!
882	Truly bad people do bad things sneakily.
883	Let’s see, how do I undo this development?
884	What is this... Too severe!
885	When the eyes of Pokémon Trainers meet,\nyou know what’s going to happen, right?\r\nA Pokémon battle!
886	Oh! Your Pokémon look[VAR 1101(00FD,0001)]s so happy that [VAR 1101(00FD,0704)]it'sthey've won!
887	The more you battle other Trainers, the more\npowerful your Pokémon will become!
888	We call Malie Garden Nugget Garden!\c\nBeat us five Trainers and win a fabulous prize!\c\nThink you got what it takes?
889	Whoo! Good stuff!
890	I did my best. I have no regrets!
891	I’m second! Now it’s serious!\n
892	How could I lose?
893	I did my best, so I’ve no regrets!
894	Here’s No. 3! I won’t be easy!
895	Ow! Stomped flat!
896	I did my best. I have no regrets!
897	I’m No. 4! Getting tired?
898	I lost, too!
899	I did my best, so I’ve no regrets!
900	OK! I’m No. 5! I’ll stomp you!
901	Whoa! Too much!
902	I did my best. I have no regrets!
903	Arrgh!\nYou are good!
904	Whoa! I’m shocked at your strength!
905	I guess I’m burned out after all...
906	That’s fighting spirit!
907	Whee! Whee! It’s a battle...a battle!
908	Why! I lost!
909	Hey, Trainer!\c\nWhat’s “throw a ball with the Y Button” mean?\nWhat’s it mean?
910	[~ 910]
911	[~ 911]
912	[~ 912]
913	Preschooler pistons, full power!
914	Preschooler pistons, stop!
915	If the Preschooler pistons stop, Pokémon get\nthem moving for me!
916	Welcome, trial-goer!\c\nThink you can handle the ordeal of defeating\na Beauty?
917	Wow! I bet you can finish any trial!
918	Rotom Dex! Cool, cool!\c\nYou become more friendly with Rotom by\ntouching it or answering questions, right?
919	This result...what’s up with that?!
920	My swelling feelings...\nthey’ve fallen right to the bottom!
921	The waves of emotion swell...\nI’m so frustrated with losing that I wanna scream!
922	Run, run...run away...\nThis is no rendezvous!
923	I couldn’t get it done...\nDon’t worry about it, my precious Pokémon...
924	Hunh! I can’t even stand myself right now!
925	I’m gonna belt out everything inside of me!\nI’ve gotta encourage my Pokémon to keep rocking!
926	That Kukui...he discovered a great Trainer.
927	I couldn’t win even though I went all out...\nBut what a refreshing feeling. Woo!
928	I couldn’t win even though I went all out...\nBut what a refreshing feeling. Woo!
929	I couldn’t win even though I went all out...\nBut what a refreshing feeling. Woo!
930	Even though I prepared my top moves to be like\nProfessor Kukui!
931	The gloom that enfolds us like fog...we can’t seem to shake\nit off.
932	Are we headed to the grave, yo? Will our bones be\nlaid bare, yo?
933	There may be no winning or losing before true full power!
934	There may be no winning or losing before true full power!
935	There may be no winning or losing before true full power!
936	Hmph.\nThere’s nothing more to say.
937	Hmph.\nThere’s nothing more to say.
938	I couldn’t win even though I went all out...\nBut what a refreshing feeling. Woo!
939	I couldn’t win even though I went all out...\nBut what a refreshing feeling. Woo!
940	Sensational!
941	Sensational!
942	Sensational!
943	Our first defeat! Sorry, Popplio!
944	Our first defeat! Sorry, Rowlet!
945	Our first defeat! Sorry, Litten!
946	Another defeat...\nI do not understand it!
947	It seems we’re still not drawing out the full potential of\nour Pokémon...
948	Do I... Do I understand my Pokémon a little better, now?
949	Was I... Was I able to draw out the potential of my Pokémon,\nat least a little bit?
950	Whoa! I’m shocked at your strength!
951	Yes! You have emerged victorious!
952	Well! Once again, you certainly reeled me in.
953	Not enough dancing!
954	Sure enough, when it comes to you and Pokémon,\nthe quality of the ingredients shines forth!
955	I couldn’t get it done...\nDon’t worry about it, my precious Pokémon...
956	...
957	Thud! That’s the sound of your\nstrength rocking me to my core!
958	That Kukui...\nHe certainly found an interesting Trainer for me to face!
959	We’re gonna keep moving forward, by staying at full power all\nthe time!
960	We’re gonna keep moving forward, by staying at full power all\nthe time!
961	We’re gonna keep moving forward, by staying at full power all\nthe time!
962	That Kukui...\nHe certainly found an interesting Trainer for me to face!
963	The calm sea, or the stormy sea...\nWhich do you prefer?
964	I guess I prefer calm, at least for my opponents...
965	I like the sea in any of its moods...\nIt’s always the same ocean, after all.
966	I have stayed on this island to train both myself\nand my Pokémon... Witness our power!
967	Have I been left behind by the level of strength in society?!
968	I asked my disciple to come pick me up using\nSharpedo when I became strong enough, but\r\nI’ve been waiting for quite some time, now...
969	I’m just a lost Sightseer, always looking for\nmy boyfriend!
970	I’m just lost in battle, too, always looking for a way to win!
971	We’re all travelers in life, always looking for\nsomething or other.
972	Isn’t this a beautiful spot? I can train here in\npeace and calm.
973	It’s so calming here... I can’t bring out my fighting spirit...
974	I know, I’ll perfect a style of fighting that lets\nme win even when I don’t want to fight!
975	Winning at a Pokémon battle is easier than fixing\nmy truck!
976	...I would have won if I didn’t lose!
977	Oh, I’ll fix my truck, too... Once I figure out what\nI’m doing!
978	I’ll fight with all my strength and more, in order\nto protect Aether Paradise!
979	Well! Facing you, I bet even people who pick on Pokémon\nwill run away!
980	I don’t know what some of the employees here\ndo. There are so many different people in\r\nAether Paradise, after all.
981	This is where I proposed to my wife...\nShe’s...been gone for a while, now.
982	My dear wife... Please, guide my way, like how a lighthouse\nguides a ship!
983	As a Trainer, it’s up to me to guide my Pokémon.
984	I’m working to be the best in the world at\nswimming! Help me train!
985	I need more muscle to swim across all the seas of Alola!
986	I guess Poliwrath has the best muscles\nfor swimming...
987	Welcome to my Secret Base! It’s so secret, I bet\nyou don’t even know where it is! I’ll tell you if\r\nyou can beat me!
988	Waaah! A secret’s a secret, whether I win or lose!
989	It’s a secret...because we haven’t made it yet!\nEven what kind of Secret Base it’s going to be is\r\na super, super secret!
990	The Pokémon of one of our guests and my own\nPokémon became friends, so we’re taking a\r\nwalk together.
991	I...I let our precious guest down...
992	I think we may be on our way to the\nKanto region...
993	Alola, Trainer! Alola, Pokémon!
994	So even the combined power of a fiery Vulpix and a cool\nVulpix couldn’t beat you!
995	Vulpix and Vulpix. ♪\nEven if they look different between Kanto and\r\nAlola, they’re still friends!
996	Hey now! It’s dangerous to stand in front of a\nGolfer, Trainer!
997	Foooooooooooore!
998	“Fore!” is golf lingo to warn others who are in\nthe flight path of a golf ball! You should watch\r\nout when walking in front of other Trainers, too!
999	I wanted to go swimming once it rained, but the\nrain isn’t filling it up at all! It’s so annoying!
1000	Oh, the rain... The rain is flowing away...
1001	The rain of Alola... What can it even wash away...
1002	Bonjour! I’m a Team Skull Grunt, back from the\nKalos region!
1003	Hold on, hold on... I’m not used to being tough!
1004	Even in the Kalos region, Ilima was acting all\nhigh and mighty!
1005	My partner utilized hula as part of her\nkarate moves!
1006	I’m all shook up!
1007	There was a Pokémon in distant lands that\nfought gracefully, as if it was dancing. I think it\r\nwas called Hitmontop.
1008	Oh, only one Pokémon? You need a bigger party\nthan that!
1009	Instead of a fish Pokémon, a Trainer appeared!
1010	The Trainer brought me defeat!
1011	If I don’t catch a fish Pokémon, it means I can\nkeep fishing as long as I want!
1012	What’re you looking for, yo?\nThat sounds like Team Skull, doesn’t it?
1013	Are you for real, yo?!
1014	I came all the way from Akala Island, searching\nfor something I lost. The thing is, I completely\r\nforgot what it was I was looking for!
1015	An Exeggutor and an Alolan Exeggutor\nhave met!
1016	Just lookin’ at the Exeggutor makes me happy...
1017	I think the Exeggutor’s Trainer used Attract on\nme, too... ♪
1018	You and I can never meet, so long as you only\nhave one Pokémon in your party.
1019	This Sightseer with a tiny Exeggutor’s been\npestering me nonstop!
1020	I think I heard Exeggutor’s Telepathy!
1021	An Exeggutor that looks down, and an Exeggutor\nthat looks up... Y’know, it may be a good team.
1022	If you want to see our precious Exeggutor, you\nneed to have at least two Pokémon with you!
1023	Hey, hand over your Buginium Z! I don’t care\nwhether you have one or not!
1024	The Buginium Z... Mr. Guzma...
1025	You take care of your Z-Crystals, you hear me?!
1026	Who...who am I? I remember nothing, except that\nI was a Trainer! Maybe if I battle, I’ll recall more!
1027	Thanks to the shock of being defeated, I feel like my memory\nis coming back!
1028	I’m lightly dressed... Maybe I was a Hiker before\nI lost my memories?!
1029	I ended up here in Resolution Cave while\nsearching for more trials.
1030	You appear as a grand trial before us!
1031	The trial called life doesn’t end until you run out\nof energy. You might as well enjoy it!
1032	Captain Kiawe is teaching me how to dance!
1033	Dance, dance. ♪
1034	Dancing with your Pokémon in perfect sync...\nIt’s the best!
1035	Training, training. ♪ Dancing and Pokémon, both\nneed more training. ♪
1036	Round and round, I’m spinning round and round...
1037	Pokémon are actually better at dancing than my\nmom or my teacher!
1038	I was looking for the Poké Ball I threw,\nbut I found a Pokémon Trainer instead!
1039	No Poké Ball, and no victory either!
1040	I’m looking for a Poké Ball I threw from\nSeafolk Village.
1041	The best place to train as a Firefighter is at the\nBattle Tree!
1042	And here I was all fired up to take on the Battle Tree...
1043	As a Firefighter I know one thing! Fire always\nmoves up!
1044	No matter how good you are at surfing, you\ncan’t ride the waves on a stormy sea! Don’t\r\nfight the waves! You’ve gotta ride with them!
1045	Some waves are too big for anyone to ride...
1046	Mantine Surf is something else, too! Watching\npeople be so in tune with Mantine, riding the\r\nwaves as if they’re dancing!
1047	I didn’t realize that there was such a big difference between\nus in how many Trainers we’ve battled!
1048	My stomach, my stomach’s all weak, yo...\nI don’t think I can handle this, yo...
1049	Oh man, I guess that’s that.
1050	Perhaps, somewhere in my heart, I was hoping I would lose...
1051	No! My big bro’s Pokémon...
1052	Wow, it’s fun to have Pokémon battles with people!
1053	Crabrawler is so full of power, it’s practically shining!
1054	I’m feeling it! I’m feeling that special bond!
1055	It’s raining in my heart, too... I wonder, will there be a rainbow\nwhen it lets up...?
1056	...Impressive. I think I can trust you.
1057	Seriously?! You’re way too strong, yo!
1058	[~ 1058]
1059	Agh! You’re too powerful!
1060	[~ 1060]
1061	I lost even though I was so pumped up and\nfull of cheer!
1062	Oooh my...
1063	Hmph! Looks like we burnt out.
1064	My, how vexing to face off against such a\nskilled young child...
1065	I didn’t get to try it out enough!
1066	I hope you enjoyed yourself!
1067	Oh, congratulations! Would you like to order\nanother drink?
1068	Oh, well done, [VAR 1100(00FF,0503)]sirmadam! You’ll be the Kantonian\nin no time, I’m sure!
1069	Oh, you’re such a tease! I bet I’m not even the\nfirst Trainer you’ve beaten here!
1070	Arrrgh! My authentic, Kanto-style Pokémon!
1071	I hope you enjoyed yourself!
1072	Oh, congratulations! Would you like to order\nanother drink?
1073	Oh, well done, [VAR 1100(00FF,0503)]sirmadam! You’ll be the Kantonian\nin no time, I’m sure!

1076	I’m gonna belt out everything inside of me!\nI’ve gotta encourage my Pokémon to keep rocking!
1077	My fragile heart...broken... My strength...burned up...
1078	Hahaha! You’re good!
1079	If only I had love!
1080	Well, I lost! So, can I still have that scoop?!
1081	Oh, come on now! Do you want me to sulk?
1082	I’ll eventually be the strongest, and it’ll be awesome...\nNah.
1083	Oh, so that’s your strategy? Not bad at all!
1084	Team Rocket has now become...Team Rainbow\nRocket! Witness our reborn strength!
1085	I’ve witnessed your strength! I can’t take any more!
1086	It doesn’t matter how strong you are... Our boss\nis waaaaaaaaaaaaaay stronger!
1087	Oh, what a cute little child! You should go home\nbefore you get hurt!
1088	I guess I should be the one heading home, but I need to figure\nout where home is...
1089	You’ll regret opposing Team Rainbow Rocket!\nYou’ll see!
1090	Do you want to know why we were able to take\nover the foundation so easily...?
1091	I bet you do!
1092	There is a turncoat in the foundation.\c\nThe meaning of “turncoat”?\n...L-look it up yourself!
1093	You can only bow down before our perfect plan!
1094	Our plan... Maybe it’s not so perfect?!
1095	Our boss’s plan is amazing! I don’t really know\nthe details, but it’s definitely amazing!
1096	You haven’t heard it in a while, so... Aiyee!
1097	Here’s an impression for you: Aiyee!

1109	I’m the biggest fan of Muk in all of Team RR!\nYou’ll never get past me!
1110	I really love Muk, but that doesn’t make me a strong\nPokémon Trainer!
1111	The only reason I even decided to participate in\nthis take-over plan is so I could see Alolan Muk!
1112	Yellow, green, blue, blue...
1113	Red, yellow, green, yellow...
1114	I couldn’t keep my promise to the boss...
1115	I guess I’m not getting very far!
1116	Why is nobody following me?!
1117	It was a battle against loneliness!
1118	Everything I do today just doesn’t work out!
1119	Wow, what a downer!
1120	P-please, sir! Get revenge for me!
1121	I wanted to show the newbie how good I was, but...
1122	Not even a single Rattata is getting past me!
1123	Y-you’re too strong! How am I supposed to stop that?!
1124	These arrows on the floor... They never take me\nto where I want to go.
1125	I...I need to use the restroom... But these...these\narrows... They just... Aaaauugh!
1126	Oh, cruel world...
1127	Blasted arrows! They make everything more\ncomplicated than it needs to be...
1128	Do you never get tired?!
1129	What? Do you have a Max Revive for people or something?!
1130	I’ve spotted the intruder before the Meowth\nstatues did!
1131	Meow could you...
1132	Even if you get past me, you’ll never evade the\ngaze of the Meowth! But you’re not allowed to\r\ntouch the back of the Meowth, OK?
1133	Meow meow Meowth!
1134	My plan to ambush you by hiding among the Meowth has\nclearly failed...
1135	Y’know, I wonder why all these security system\nstatues are modeled after Meowth...?
1136	I saw what you were doing—I just couldn’t keep up...
1137	If you turn 360 degrees, you’ll be facing me again!
1138	I fell behind, but only by an inch...
1139	Like I figured...
1140	Impressive.\nYour prowess is notable.
1141	Impressive.\nYour prowess is notable.
1142	I can feel the fire of your convictions burning deep within\nyour heart!
1143	I can feel the fire of your convictions burning deep within\nyour heart!
1144	I couldn’t have been defeated by some random Trainer from\nwho knows where!
1145	I couldn’t have been defeated by some random Trainer from\nwho knows where!
1146	Ha! That was a truly intense fight!
1147	My Pokémon each gave it their best.
1148	Maaasssttteerrr!
1149	Mount Lanakila towers above us all! This is a\nnew joy for Hikers only. I won’t let anyone else\r\ntrample all over this beauty!
1150	A Trainer and Pokémon bigger than...any mountain?!
1151	Now isn’t that something? You’re more of a\nchallenge than Mount Lanakila itself!
1152	Have at you!
1153	Please, let me have a moment with my Pokémon, now that\nthey’re back in their Poké Balls.
1154	I strive to never let myself down... And even\nmore so, to never let my Pokémon down, since\r\nthey fight for me against any odds!
1155	It’s not just Pokémon! We Trainers need to\nevolve, too!
1156	This frustration... This disappointment I feel... This is what will\nhelp me evolve!
1157	The way you battle changes, and the way you\nthink changes, too... That’s how we evolve!
1158	I hear something interesting’s been built, so I\njust had to see it for myself.
1159	The way you and your Pokémon battle—that was definitely\nworth seeing!
1160	The world is fascinating—it’s just full of things\nI’ve never seen before!
1161	We dug the tunnels! We made the path! Now,\nwe’re gonna challenge a challenger!
1162	This challenger is something else! Definitely one that won’t\nbe beaten easily!
1163	It makes me happy to see so many people\npass through Victory Road, which me and my\r\nPokémon worked so hard to complete!
1164	We may be away from our home, but our Fighting\nDojo travels with us! And all are welcome!
1165	I couldn’t even do my sway-back move!
1166	We came all the way from the Kanto region, but\nI think we’re better off heading back to\r\nSaffron City.
1167	You need more Pokémon if you want to face us!
1168	Two Black Belts at once! This is going to be a\nhead-on battle, you understand?
1169	A head-on battle...and we lost...?
1170	We thought that if we could become the best in\nthe Alola region, we’d get more students...
1171	You need more Pokémon if you want to face us!
1172	Osu! The guy next to me says “osu,” too!
1173	How frustrating! The guy next to me feels frustrated, too!
1174	Osu! It means to push forward, in spite of\ndifficulties and setbacks!
1175	You need more Pokémon if you want to face us!
1176	Put your strength into the area below your\nbelly button!
1177	I’m losing my strength...
1178	Take deep breaths before a big endeavor!\nYou must always remain calm!
1179	You need more Pokémon if you want to face us!
1180	I keep losing, but I think this next battle I’m\ngonna win!
1181	Agh... Another loss! Another defeat! A fail of\nepic proportions!
1182	If you keep losing, and losing, and losing, you\ncan keep believing that you’ll win next time!\c\nThat’s why I keep challenging people to battles!
1183	Just having a Z-Power Ring or Z-Crystals\ndoesn’t mean anything—the power they hold\r\nmeans nothing unless you use it!
1184	You... It seems like you know the strength of the power you\nhold, and its dangers, too.
1185	Just being together with your Pokémon won’t\nhelp you win, either. You need to understand\r\neach other!
1186	All my Pokémon! All my luggage! I’ve got my\nPoké Balls, my backpack, both full of dreams!
1187	You’re full of strength, and we fully admit defeat!
1188	My heart’s full of memories, too, y’know! And\nthey include my battle with you now!
1189	My desire knows no bounds! I want both victory\nand all the Pokémon!
1190	The victory I so desired is now beyond my grasp...
1191	Not being able to get something only makes me\nwant it more!
1192	I never stop honing my skills as an ace!
1193	My skills as an ace...they meant nothing against you!
1194	You carry on ahead! We will continue to hone\nour skills and will surpass you someday!
1195	Only one partner?! Impressive, but you need at\nleast two Pokémon if you want to face us!
1196	My skills as a Veteran have not dwindled!
1197	My skills as a Veteran were not enough against you, eh...
1198	You should move on ahead! We will train more\nand will catch up with you someday!
1199	Only one partner?! Impressive, but you need at\nleast two Pokémon if you want to face us!
1200	Battō!
1201	Men! Kote! Do! Tsuki!
1202	Ippon!
1203	Tachi-ai!
1204	Tsuba-zeriai!
1205	Maitta!
1206	Do you think you’re smart enough to navigate\nthis warp panel labyrinth?!
1207	It looks like the only one lost...is me!
1208	If you’re lost, defeating me won’t help with that,\nyou know.
1209	Hah! If I capture you, I’m up for a promotion!
1210	I couldn’t seize you, or my chance for a promotion!
1211	Oh well, better luck with the next intruder,\nI guess!
1212	You poor, little, lost Mareep! I’ll take good care\nof you!
1213	What are you, a Gyarados in Mareep’s clothing?!
1214	You want to get back to the entrance?\nJust jump into one out of the two!
1215	Welcome to a dead end!
1216	It’s not my fault you’re not getting anywhere!
1217	Don’t think too much about why I might be\nguarding a dead end...
1218	You there! Identify yourself!
1219	Such power...
1220	You were strong enough to defeat my Raticate...\nHeh, very well. You’re worthy!
1221	I won’t go easy on you, just because you’re a\nkid! It’s time you learned to fear adults!
1222	Who said age mattered, anyway?!
1223	Hey, we adults are doing our best, too, y’know!\nGo easy on us!
1224	Your bad luck to wander into my territory!
1225	Well, lucky you!
1226	I only signed up for Team RR because I was told\nrainbow color was my lucky color!
1227	I’ll do anything to help our boss!
1228	Man, I feel so useless...
1229	Hey, were the guys in charge of being the wall\nuseful for the boss, at least?
1230	Your relentless advance stops here!
1231	...Or maybe it doesn’t!
1232	Relentless means to never relent!
1233	You got past the first floor?! Right, I need to\nstop you right here!
1234	You’re unstoppable!
1235	Well, at least I stalled you a little bit!\nWhat a joke!
1236	Alola, trial-goer!\nHave you never seen a Surfer before?
1237	I’ll ride waves even if I’m not feelin’ it! That’s what Surfers do,\nafter all!
1238	I prefer riding waves with just my board, but I\ngotta say that Mantine Surf looks cool, too!
1239	Even if I can’t surf well, that doesn’t stop me\nfrom enjoying Pokémon battles!
1240	Even if I lose the Pokémon battle...I can still surf!
1241	I try to enjoy Pokémon battles when I can’t surf\nwell, and I go surfing when I get beaten in battle!\r\nThat way, I can have fun 24 hours a day!
1242	Who have you met, and what did you choose?
1243	No doubt about it! You chose Pokémon, didn’t you?
1244	I met my Pokémon, but I also met my surfboard.\nAnd I ended up choosing both!
1245	Ha! That was a truly intense fight!
1246	Such a strange feeling...\nI feel somehow proud, despite being defeated.
1247	I don’t understand!
1248	Fighting together with your Pokémon...\nIt is not something we had considered ourselves.
1249	You’re a tough one, I’ll give ya that! I have fun battlin’ you,\neven if I can’t beat you down!
1250	I sensed the strength that you possess as Champion.
1251	I’m gonna belt out everything inside of me!\nI’ve gotta encourage my Pokémon to keep rocking!
1252	You got a piece of me!\nAnd I guess I shouldn’t have messed with you...
1253	You had me dancing to your tune, all right!
1254	So I have failed to understand Poipole!
1255	It is not Poipole that failed in this battle.\nIt is I, as a Trainer, who have failed...
1256	You’ll have to bring more Pokémon if you want\nto dance!
1257	If you want to practice dancing with us, you\nneed at least two Pokémon!
1258	Why don’t we battle two Pokémon at a time?
1259	Hello there, Trainer! Oh, you only have one\nPokémon ready for battle?

10	Perhaps because it would like to grow up\nquickly, it has a voracious appetite, eating\na hundred leaves a day.
11	Its shell is filled with a thick liquid. All of the\ncells throughout its body are being rebuilt in\npreparation for evolution.
12	Its wings are covered in toxic scales. If it finds\nbird Pokémon going after Caterpie, Butterfree\nsprinkles its scales on them to drive them off.
13

19	Its incisors grow continuously throughout its life.\nIf its incisors get too long, this Pokémon\nbecomes unable to eat, and it starves to death.
20	People say that it fled from its enemies by\nusing its small webbed hind feet to swim\nfrom island to island in Alola.
21	Its reckless nature leads it to stand up to\nothers—even large Pokémon—if it has to protect\nits territory.
22	Carrying food through Fearow’s territory is\ndangerous. It will snatch the food away from\nyou in a flash!
23	By dislocating its jaw, it can swallow prey larger\nthan itself. After a meal, it curls up and rests.
24	The latest research has determined that there\nare over 20 possible arrangements of the\npatterns on its stomach.
25	Its nature is to store up electricity. Forests\nwhere nests of Pikachu live are dangerous,\nsince the trees are so often struck by lightning.
26	As electricity builds up inside its body, it\nbecomes more aggressive. One theory is that\nthe electricity buildup is actually causing stress.
27	It lives in areas of limited rainfall. When danger\napproaches, it curls up into a ball to protect its\nsoft stomach.
28	Its claws and horns often break off. The broken\nclaws and horns can be used to carve plows for\ntilling farm fields.

35	They’re popular, but they’re rare. Trainers who\nshow them off recklessly may be targeted\nby thieves.
36	It can’t help but hear a pin drop from over half\na mile away, so it lives deep in the mountains\nwhere there aren’t many people or Pokémon.
37	Its beautiful tails have made it very popular.\nHowever, if it’s not brushed diligently, it will\nbe a mass of tangles before you know it.
38	It is vindictive and relentless by nature.\nThose who cross it even once will be cursed for\na thousand years, along with their descendants.
39	Recordings of Jigglypuff’s strange lullabies can\nbe purchased from department stores. These\nCDs can be found near the bedding area.
40	Thanks to its bouncy body and fine fur,\nthis Pokémon is sought after. Holding one\nin your arms while you sleep feels great.
41	It has no eyeballs, so it can’t see. It checks its\nsurroundings via the ultrasonic waves it emits\nfrom its mouth.
42	Every once in a while, you’ll see a Golbat that’s\nmissing some fangs. This happens when hunger\ndrives it to try biting a Steel-type Pokémon.
43	
44	
45	
46	Whether it’s due to a lack of moisture or a lack\nof nutrients, in Alola the mushrooms on Paras\ndon’t grow up quite right.
47	The bug is mostly dead, with the mushroom on\nits back having become the main body. If the\nmushroom comes off, the bug stops moving.
48	
49	
50	It travels through tunnels that it digs\nunderground. It hates sunlight, so it comes\nout only after the sun goes down.
51	While the three of them normally get along\nsplendidly, on rare occasions a huge fight will\nbreak out over which head gets to eat first.
52	When visiting a junkyard, you may catch sight\nof it having an intense fight with Murkrow over\nshiny objects.
53	Although the jewel on its forehead appears to\nbe a different color than those of Alolan\nPersian, it’s mostly made of the same material.
54	Using psychokinesis gives it a headache, so it\nnormally passes the time spacing out and doing\nas little as possible.
55	Even fast-swimming fish Pokémon can be\ndisabled by Golduck. It brings them to a\nstandstill and seizes them.
56	The smallest of things could cause it to lose its\ntemper. Because it doesn’t hold in its stress,\nthis Pokémon can live a long time.
57	It will never forgive opponents who have\nangered it. Even after it has beaten them down\nuntil they can’t move, it never ever forgives.
58	While it’s quite friendly toward humans once it’s\ngrown used to them, in the wild it must be quite\nfierce to defend its territory from Rockruff.
59	Legends tell of its fighting alongside a general\nand conquering a whole country.
60	Despite the danger, it wants to come up on land.\nSo it does its best to waddle along, but when\nan enemy finds it, it rushes back to the water.
61	Although it has become capable of living on\nland, it spends its time in the water, where\nits prey, fish Pokémon, are plentiful.
62	It’s quite a gifted swimmer, even among\nWater-type Pokémon, but it normally spends its\ntime on land.
63	It uses various psychic powers even while it’s\nsleeping, so you can’t tell whether or not\nit’s awake.
64	It stares at a silver spoon to amplify its psychic\npowers before it lets loose. Apparently, gold\nspoons are no good.
65	Alakazam uses its psychic powers to make the\nspoons it carries. Each spoon is an original that\nthere’s only one of in the whole world.
66	Once this Pokémon has gained enough\nconfidence and muscle from training with its\nfriends, it challenges Makuhita to a battle.
67	When it encounters an enemy that’s truly\nmighty, this Pokémon removes the power-save\nbelt from its waist and unleashes its full power.
68	It grasps its opponents with its four arms and\ntwists them up in an intricate hold. People call\nit “the Machamp special.”
69	
70	
71	
72	It drifts through the sea searching for prey.\nIts poisonous tentacles break off sometimes,\nbut after a while, they grow back.
73	It fires off ultrasonic waves from its red orbs\nto weaken its prey, and then it wraps them up\nin its 80 tentacles.
74	Geodude that have lived a long life have had all\ntheir edges smoothed out until they’re totally\nround. They also have a calm, quiet disposition.
75	It climbs up cliffs as it heads toward the peak\nof a mountain. As soon as it reaches the summit,\nit rolls back down the way it came.
76	When Golem grow old, they stop shedding their\nshells. Those that have lived a long, long time\nhave shells green with moss.
77	
78	
79	There are some places where Slowpoke is\nworshiped because of a long-standing belief\nthat whenever Slowpoke yawns, it rains.
80	Spacing out is basically all it does. It turns back\ninto Slowpoke if its tail, along with Shellder,\nbreaks off.
81	It’s frequently the cause of power outages,\nwhich is why some power plants send out\nelectrical signals that it can’t stand.
82	Delicate equipment can malfunction in areas\ninhabited by Magneton, which send out\nmysterious electrical signals.
83	
84	
85	
86	It has always been supposed that Seel live only\nin cold seas. Their having shown up in Alola is\na mystery.
87	It swims through the ocean at a speed of eight\nknots, searching for Pokémon that will become\nits prey. It’s especially fond of Wishiwashi.
88	It was born from sludge on the ocean floor. In a\nsterile environment, the germs within its body\ncan’t multiply, and it dies.
89	Their food sources have decreased, and their\nnumbers have declined sharply. Sludge ponds\nare being built to prevent their extinction.
90	The sand that accumulates inside its shell\neventually becomes a pearl. But the pearl gets\nin the way, so it spits it out and discards it.
91	If areas of Cloyster’s very hard shell get\ndamaged, those areas swell, gradually growing\ninto large sharp spikes.
92	It’s said that gas emanating from a graveyard\nwas possessed by the grievances of the\ndeceased and thus became a Pokémon.
93	On moonless nights, Haunter searches for\nsomeone to curse, so it’s best not to go out\nwalking around.
94	You can hear tales told all over the world about\nhow Gengar will pay a visit to children who\nare naughty.
95	
96	It can be spotted near recreational facilities,\nintending to eat the pleasant dreams of children\nwho enjoyed themselves there that day.
97	In Alola, Komala is Hypno’s main target. It rarely\nharms people.
98	
99	
100	
101	
102	Six of them form a single Pokémon. Should one\nof the six be lost, the next morning there will\nonce more be six.
103	It engages its enemies using psychic powers.\nEach of its three heads fires off psychokinetic\nenergy, tripling its power.
104	At night, it weeps loudly for its dead mother,\nbut those cries only attract its natural\nenemy—Mandibuzz.
105	It throws bones at Mandibuzz to knock it down.\nIt’s thought that Marowak is trying to avenge\nits parent.
106	
107	
108	It checks out whatever’s around it by licking\neverything. If you don’t clean off a spot where\nit’s licked you, you’ll break out in a rash!
109	
110	
111	
112	
113	It seems that other Pokémon’s efforts to take\nits delicious, nutritious egg away from it caused\nChansey to get faster at fleeing.
114	
115	Kangaskhan protects its child by keeping it in\nits pouch. It has zero forgiveness for those\nwho harm its child and will beat them down.
116	
117	
118	Although known for their splendid tail fins,\nGoldeen apparently compete among themselves\nto see whose horn is thickest and sharpest.
119	Its horn spins like a drill to steadily hollow out\nrocks—even harder ones. The coloration of the\nmale is more vivid.
120	In many places, there are folktales of stardust\nfalling into the ocean and becoming Staryu.
121	Its sparkling core is called “the gem of the sea.”\nThis core can be made into high-priced\naccessories that are traded in secret.
122	Its pantomime skills are wonderful. You may\nbecome enraptured while watching it, but next\nthing you know, Mr. Mime has made a real wall.
123	Its two sharp scythes are more than just\nweapons. It uses them with dexterity to dress\nits prey before eating.
124	It sways its hips to a rhythm all its own. The\nprecise movements of Jynx living in Alola are\ntruly wonderful.
125	Electricity permeates its body. It swings\nits arms round and round to charge up\nelectricity before unleashing a punch.
126	Its entire body is burning. When it breathes,\nthe temperature rises. When it sneezes, flames\nshoot out!
127	It gets into territorial disputes with Vikavolt.\nFor some reason, it apparently gets along well\nwith Heracross in Alola.
128	They live in groups. The one with the longest,\nthickest, and most-scarred horns is the boss\nof the herd.
129	In the distant past, they were fairly strong, but\nthey have become gradually weaker over time.
130	It fires hyper beams in all directions, burning the\nsurrounding area to ash. There are some regions\nwhere it’s called “the deity of destruction.”
131	It likes swimming around with people on its\nback. In the Alola region, it’s an important means\nof transportation over water.
132	While it can transform into anything, each Ditto\napparently has its own strengths and\nweaknesses when it comes to transformations.
133	The question of why only Eevee has such\nunstable genes has still not been solved.
134	Clean, clear waters are its usual habitat. When\nit’s about to be attacked by an invading enemy,\nit dives into the water to hide.
135	Its lungs contain an organ that creates\nelectricity. The crackling sound of electricity\ncan be heard when it exhales.
136	If it inhales deeply, that’s a sign it’s about to\nattack. Prepare to be hit by flames of over\n3,000 degrees Fahrenheit!
137	This Pokémon was created using the\ncutting-edge science of 20 years ago, so\nmany parts of it have since become obsolete.
138	Omanyte lived in the seas of antiquity. Its\nfossils have been found bearing bite marks from\nArcheops, so apparently Archeops preyed on it.
139	Its heavy shell is thought to be the reason this\nancient Pokémon died out. It’s apparently a\ndistant ancestor of Octillery.
140	This Pokémon thrived 300 million years ago. It’s\nsaid that living specimens can still be seen\nin a certain region—a rare sight.
141	Its body had begun to change so it could\nfunction on land. But it didn’t adapt in time and\nwent extinct.
142	Restored from DNA found in amber, this\nPokémon exhibited ferocity that was greater\nthan expected. Some casualties resulted.
143	It doesn’t do anything other than eat and sleep.\nWhen prompted to make a serious effort,\nthough, it apparently displays awesome power.
144	
145	
146	
147	It’s still weak, so it lurks on the floor of bodies\nof water, eating whatever food sinks down and\nliving a quiet life.
148	Lakes where Dragonair live are filled with\nofferings from people, because they believe this\nPokémon is able to control the weather.
149	It flies over raging seas as if they were nothing.\nObserving this, a ship’s captain dubbed this\nPokémon “the sea incarnate.”

163	Every day, it tilts its head in the same rhythm.\nA long time ago, people raised these Pokémon\nto serve as clocks.
164	With eyes that can see in pitch-darkness, it\nnever lets its prey escape. Some even call it\n“the emperor of dark nights.”
165	This Pokémon is very sensitive to cold. In the\nwarmth of Alola, it appears quite lively.
166	It’s said that the patterns on its back are\nrelated to the stars in the night sky, but the\ndetails of that relationship remain unclear.
167	With threads from its mouth, it fashions sturdy\nwebs that won’t break even if you set a rock\non them.
168	Every night, it wanders around in search of\nprey, whose movements it restrains by spewing\nthreads before it bites into them with its fangs.
169	Its fangs are so sharp, if it bites you in the dark\nand sucks your blood, you won’t notice any pain\nor realize you’ve been bitten.
170	Its two antennae glow softly to lure in prey,\nmaking it a useful Pokémon for night fishing.
171	When the bacteria living inside its antennae\nabsorb Lanturn’s bodily fluids, a strong\nluminescent effect is produced.
172	It still can’t use electricity well. When it’s\nsurprised or excited, it discharges\nelectricity unintentionally.
173	On nights with many shooting stars,\nthey gather in packs and dance in circles. If you\nshould see them, something good will happen!
174	It’s always practicing its singing because it\nwants to improve. Even when it’s asleep,\nit keeps singing in its dreams!
175	
176	
177	Although it still can’t fly, its jumping power is\noutstanding. It jumps way up into trees and\nplucks the buds from the branches.
178	It’s said that while this Pokémon has the power\nto predict the future, it’s not powerful enough\nto change the future it sees.
179	Clothing made from Mareep’s fleece is easily\ncharged with static electricity, so a special\nprocess is used on it.
180	In the places on its body where fleece doesn’t\ngrow, its skin is rubbery and doesn’t conduct\nelectricity. Those spots are safe to touch.
181	The light from its tail can be seen from space.\nThis is why you can always tell exactly where it\nis, which is why it usually keeps the light off.
182	
183	
184	
185	It’s so popular with the elderly that there’s a\nmagazine devoted to this Pokémon. Fans obsess\nover the particular length and angle of its arms.
186	Although its cries sound like screams, a\ncomposer created a beautiful ballad that was\ninfluenced by the sounds.
187	
188	
189	
190	As it did more and more with its tail, its hands\nbecame clumsy. It makes its nest high in\nthe treetops.
191	
192	
193	
194	
195	
196	Although it originally had no powers at all,\npeople say its precognitive faculties were\nawakened by its need to protect itself.
197	This Pokémon is nocturnal. Even in total\ndarkness, its large eyes can spot its\nprey clearly!
198	It has a weakness for shiny things. It’s been\nknown to sneak into the nests of Gabite—noted\ncollectors of jewels—in search of treasure.
199	It’s constantly coming up with new ideas that\nwould change the world, but as soon as it\nhits upon a new idea, it forgets it.
200	What gives meaning to its life is surprising\nothers. If you set your ear against the red orbs\naround its neck, you can hear shrieking.
201	
202	
203	
204	Motionless, it hangs from trees, waiting for\nits bug Pokémon prey to come to it. Its favorite\nin Alola is Cutiefly.
205	When something approaches it, it fires off\nfragments of its steel shell in attack. This is not\na conscious action but a conditioned reflex.
206	It travels by digging through the ground.\nDiglett and Dunsparce share one another’s\ntunnels happily.
207	
208	
209	It grows close to others easily and is also easily\nspoiled. The disparity between its face and its\nactions makes many young people wild about it.
210	While it has powerful jaws, it doesn’t care for\ndisputes, so it rarely has a chance to display\ntheir might.
211	
212	Its body is like steel. Its tough, heavy pincers\nare more suited to smashing enemies than\ngrabbing them.
213	
214	It’s proud of its thick horn. In Alola, its biggest\nrival is Vikavolt, which it’s always fighting with.
215	They will cooperate to steal eggs from the nests\nof bird Pokémon, but fights break out to\ndetermine which one gets to eat the eggs.
216	
217	
218	
219	
220	
221	
222	The pink of Corsola that live in Alola is deep\nand vibrant, thanks to seas filled with nutrition.
223	This Pokémon clings to Mantine and shares in\nits prosperity. When its Mantine is attacked,\nRemoraid will fight alongside it!
224	The ink it spits when escaping is special.\nIt contains a substance that dulls the sense of\nsmell, so Pokémon with keen noses get lost.
225	It shares its food with people who are stranded.\nBecause Delibird is omnivorous, sometimes\nit gives those people bug Pokémon.
226	Postcards and posters featuring Mantine\nleaping elegantly above the waves are popular\nsouvenirs of Alola.
227	The wing feathers it sheds can be processed\nand made into knives whose sharpness is\nrecognized by the finest chefs.
228	It cooperates with others skillfully. When it\nbecomes your partner, it’s very loyal to you as\nits Trainer and will obey your orders.
229	They spew flames mixed with poison to finish\noff their opponents. They divvy up their prey\nevenly among the members of their pack.
230	
231	
232	
233	AI has been installed in it. It learns various\nthings all on its own, but it even remembers\nthings it doesn’t need to know.
234	
235	The fluid of Smeargle’s tail secretions changes\nin the intensity of its hue as the Pokémon’s\nemotions change.
236	
237	
238	When it examines things, before touching them\nwith its hands, it makes lip contact and then\ndiligently licks all the dirt off its lips.
239	When it hears the crash of thunder, Elekid’s\nmood improves. It can be useful to record that\nsound and play it when Elekid’s feeling down.
240	When flames drip from its nose, that means it\nhas a cold. Have it lie down for a nice rest in\nsome magma.
241	It produces over five gallons of milk a day. The\nhigher the quality of the pastures it lives in,\nthe richer and tastier its milk becomes.
242	Their eggs are such a delicacy that some say\neating one will bring you happiness. These eggs\nfetch the highest prices on the market.
243	
244	
245	
246	Born underground, it eats its way through dirt to\nthe surface, where its parents are. It doesn’t\ndeal well with the bright light it finds there.
247	This troublesome Pokémon can’t wait to evolve,\nso it relieves its stress by wildly propelling itself\naround using compressed gas.
248	It wanders through the mountains seeking\nopponents to fight. If it finds an opponent that’s\nnot worthy, Tyranitar ignores it and wanders on.

278	With its long, thin wings, it catches updrafts\nand flies like a glider high up into the sky.
279	It places small Pokémon into its spacious beak\nand carries them around. No one knows where\nit’s taking them.
280	
281	
282	
283	If it’s in a pinch, it will secrete a sweet liquid\nfrom the tip of its head. Syrup made from\ngathering that liquid is tasty on bread.
284	Masquerain intimidates enemies with the eyelike\npatterns of its eyespots. If that doesn’t work, it\ndeftly makes its escape on its set of four wings.

294	
295	
296	It practices its slaps by repeatedly slapping\ntree trunks. It has been known to slap an\nExeggutor and get flung away.
297	Although they enjoy comparing their strength,\nthey’re also kind. They value etiquette, praising\nopponents they battle.
298	
299	It moves less than an inch a year, but when\nit’s in a jam, it will spin and drill down into the\nground in a split second.
300	
301	
302	It digs through the ground with its hard claws\nand crunches down gems with its thick pointy\nteeth. Carbink is its favorite food.
303	A cunning and terrifying Pokémon, its cuteness\nmakes opponents let down their guard—and\nthen it swallows them whole with its huge jaws.
304	
305	
306	
307	
308	
309	Friction between the air and its fur produces\nstatic electricity. When Electrike runs, it makes\na crackling sound.
310	Manectric can be found beneath unnatural\nthunderclouds. People say it can run at the\nsame speed as lightning striking.
311	
312	
313	
314	
315	
316	
317	
318	They’re such cowards that they won’t hunt\nalone. When five or so of them get together,\nthey suddenly turn ferocious!
319	People believe that carrying one of its\ndiscarded fangs will prevent mishaps at sea,\nso the fangs are made into accessories.
320	It swims along with its mouth open and\nswallows down seawater along with its food.\nIt sprays excess water out of its nostrils.
321	They eat so many fish Pokémon that when\nWailord become too numerous, fishermen have\nto chase them off.
322	
323	
324	You can tell how it’s feeling by the smoke\nspouting from its shell. Tremendous velocity\nis a sign of good health.
325	
326	
327	Its steps are shaky and stumbling. Walking for a\nlong time makes it feel sick.
328	Its jaws are strong enough to crush rocks but\nso heavy that it can’t get up if it flips over.\nSandile seize those moments as their chance.
329	It vibrates its wings to generate ultrasonic\nwaves, causing its prey to faint. Then it buries\nthe prey alive in the sand to preserve it.
330	By flapping their wings, Flygon cause\nsandstorms that conceal Krookodile.\nThe team then splits the prey they catch.
331	
332	
333	
334	
335	
336	
337	
338	
339	Its entire body is gooey. When pecked at by\nbird Pokémon, it slips and slides its way\nto freedom.
340	Whiscash shakes the ground at high intensities\nto intimidate its opponents. It swallows its prey\nwhole—along with mud from the swamp floor.
341	Individuals that have been set free by Trainers\nwho could no longer raise them have become\ncommon, and they can now be found in Alola.
342	Its temperament is rough and it loves to fight,\nbut as soon as its pincers break off, it turns\ncowardly. It stays timid until they grow back.
343	Depictions of Pokémon similar to Baltoy have\nbeen found on the walls of caves where\nprimitive humans lived.
344	If it gets wet, its body melts. When rain starts\nto fall, it wraps its whole body up with its\npsychic powers to protect itself.
345	In ancient times, it lived in warm seas. It\ndisguised itself as seaweed to ambush its prey\nand devoured them whole when they got close.
346	Normally, it lived on shallow sea shoals. When\nthe tide went out, this Pokémon came up on\nland to search for prey.
347	When restored Anorith are released into the\nocean, they don’t thrive, because the water\ncomposition has changed since their era.
348	It lived on land and went out into the sea to\nhunt for prey. Its sharp claws were its\ngreatest weapon.
349	They look ragged, so no one catches them. They\nlook like they’d taste bad, so predators won’t\neat them. And their numbers continue to grow.
350	While Milotic is said to be the most beautiful\nPokémon, Trainers who like Feebas and have\nraised it are seemingly disappointed by Milotic.
351	Although its form changes with the weather,\nthat is apparently the result of a chemical\nreaction and not the result of its own free will.
352	It changes its hue to blend into its surroundings.\nIf no one takes notice of it for too long, it will\npout and never reveal itself.
353	It eats up emotions like malice, jealousy, and\nresentment, so some people are grateful for\nits presence.
354	It’s a stuffed toy that was thrown away and\nbecame possessed, ever searching for the one\nwho threw it away so it can exact its revenge.
355	
356	
357	The bunches of fruit growing around the necks\nof Tropius in Alola are especially sweet\ncompared to those in other regions.
358	
359	The only thing unlucky about Absol is its\nappearance. It protects fields and warns people\nof disaster, so one ought to be grateful for it.
360	
361	It feeds mainly on ice and snow. It’s only able to\nsurvive in a limited number of places in the\nwarm Alola region.
362	It freezes its prey and chews them whole.\nHowever, it prefers to eat Pokémon like Vanillite\nthat are already frozen.
363	
364	
365	
366	Despite its appearance, it’s carnivorous. It\nclamps down on its prey with both sides of its\nshell and doesn’t let go until they stop moving.
367	It’s not the strongest swimmer. It wags its tail to\nlure in its prey and then gulps them down as\nsoon as they get close.
368	The color of its body changes with the water\ntemperature. The coloration of Gorebyss in Alola\nis almost blindingly vivid.
369	Thought to have gone extinct, Relicanth was\ngiven a name that is a variation of the name of\nthe person who discovered it.
370	There was an era when it was overfished due to\nthe rumor that having one of its heart-shaped\nscales would enable you to find a sweetheart.
371	Whenever it sees bird Pokémon flying through\nthe sky, it becomes envious and smashes its\nsurroundings to bits with headbutts.
372	The cells within its body are changing at a\nbewildering pace. Its hard shell is made from\nthe same substance as bone.
373	Overjoyed at finally being able to fly, it flies all\nover the place and usually doesn’t land until it’s\ncompletely exhausted and needs to sleep.
374	Instead of blood, magnetism flows through its\nbody. When it’s feeling bad, try giving it\na magnet.
375	With its two brains, it fires powerful psychic\nenergy to stop its prey in their tracks.
376	It boasts not only psychic powers but also\nfantastic strength. It grabs its prey with its four\nlegs and holds them in place with its claws.

408	A primeval Pokémon, it possesses a hard and\nsturdy skull, lacking any intelligence within.
409	In ancient times, people would dig up fossils of\nthis Pokémon and use its skull, which is harder\nthan steel, to make helmets.
410	A mild-mannered, herbivorous Pokémon, it used\nits face to dig up tree roots to eat. The skin on\nits face was plenty tough.
411	The bones of its face are huge and hard, so\nthey were mistaken for its spine until after this\nPokémon was successfully restored.
412	
413	
414	
415	
416	
417	
418	
419	
420	
421	
422	While they normally live in the sea, they can\nfunction on land, too, until their skin dries out.
423	Long ago, it had a shell on its back. There’s now\na vestigial plate on its back that’s hard but thin.
424	In their search for comfortable trees, they get\ninto territorial disputes with groups of\nPassimian. They win about half the time.
425	Its round body is stuffed with souls and\nexpands each time it leads someone away.
426	There’s a rumor that if you catch a Drifblim\nfloating on the wind at dusk, you’ll be carried\naway to the afterlife.
427	Its arms and legs are weak, but when it rolls its\nears up tight and then unleashes them with its\nfull force, it can smash boulders to dust.
428	Lopunny regrows its coat twice a year. Mufflers\nand hats made from its fur are really warm.
429	Feared for its wrath and the curses it spreads,\nthis Pokémon will also, on a whim, cast spells\nthat help people.
430	It will absolutely not forgive failure from or\nbetrayal by its goons. It has no choice in this\nif it wants to maintain the order of the flock.
431	
432	
433	
434	
435	
436	
437	
438	It discharges moisture from its eyes, making it\nlook like it’s crying—apparently an effective way\nof getting enemies to let down their guard.
439	It does its absolute best to mimic the\nmovements and expressions of its opponents,\nbut it’s still not very good at it.
440	Usually it’s a well-behaved Pokémon, but if you\ntake its round rock away, it will cry and fuss\nand throw a big old tantrum.
441	
442	
443	It reacts to anything that moves—flies right at it\nand bites it. Sometimes it injures itself, but it\ndoesn’t care too much.
444	It loves shiny things. When it finds a Sableye\ntrying to catch a Carbink, Gabite becomes\nfuriously angry and attacks the Sableye.
445	It flies at the speed of sound while searching\nfor prey, and it has midair battles with\nSalamence as the two compete for food.
446	It hides food under its long fur, but it\nsometimes forgets about it and causes\na stinky disturbance.
447	It knows how people and Pokémon feel by\nlooking at their auras. It doesn’t approach\ndangerous opponents.
448	It concentrates its mental energy and fires off\nmysterious waves called auras, which can crush\nboulders of large size to dust.
449	
450	
451	
452	
453	
454	
455	
456	When night falls, their pink patterns begin to\nshine. They’re popular with divers, so there are\nresorts that feed them to keep them close.
457	Deep down at the bottom of the ocean, prey is\nscarce. Lumineon get into fierce disputes with\nLanturn over food.
458	It’s highly friendly and easily tamed. Tours that\ntake people swimming with Mantyke are a\nsuper-popular beach activity.
459	
460	
461	One Weavile will trip a Sandshrew and flip it\nover, and then another Weavile will deal the\nfinishing blow with its sharp claws.
462	It uses radar to monitor its territory. Intruders\nare quickly disposed of with a hyper beam.
463	A contest is under way to determine which one\ncan stick its tongue out the farthest. The\ncurrent record is...more than 82 feet.
464	
465	
466	It grips its tail, which spews electricity, and\nthen beats down opponents with the power of\nits electrified fist.
467	There are still quite a few factories that rely on\nthe flames provided by Magmortar to\nprocess metals.
468	
469	
470	Although it doesn’t like disputes, it will sharpen\nthe leaf on its tail into a blade and fight if it has\nto protect its friends.
471	It protects itself by freezing its fur into sharp\nneedles. It can drop its body temperature below\n–75 degrees Fahrenheit.
472	
473	
474	Its behavior is noticeably unstable, which is\napparently due to the incompetence of the\nengineer who updated its programming.
475	
476	Although it can control its units known as\nMini-Noses, they sometimes get lost and don’t\ncome back.
477	
478	It freezes hikers who have come to climb snowy\nmountains and carries them back to its home. It\nonly goes after men it thinks are handsome.

505	
506	This Pokémon has excellent judgment.\nIf it decides it can’t defeat an opponent,\nit immediately turns tail and vamooses.
507	The longer its black fur grows, the harder and\nmore impervious it gets. Claws and fangs can’t\neasily penetrate it.
508	It pays no mind to the cold, thanks to its long\nwarm coat. Stoutland in Alola look a\nlittle uncomfortable.

524	The hexagonal hole is its ear. Deep in that ear is\nan energy core, so if you stick your hand in\nthere, Roggenrola will be very angry!
525	The energy overflowing from its body has\nturned into orange crystals that are hard\nenough to smash diamonds.
526	When it fires off energy with all its might, the\npower creates countless fissures on its body.

545	
546	To protect itself, it shoots cotton from its body.\nWhen it gets wet in the rain, its cotton grows\nmoist and heavy, and it can’t move as well.
547	This nuisance sneaks into people’s homes,\nwhere it hides important things and scatters\ncotton all over the place.
548	Some say if you dry the leaves on its head, boil\nthem down, and drink the infusion, your vigor\nwill return, so Petilil is popular with the elderly.
549	The fragrance of its flower differs slightly\ndepending on the soil where it grew up.\nSniffing the aroma calms your heart and mind.
550	Savage, violent Pokémon, red and blue Basculin\nare always fighting each other over territory.
551	Alola, where it’s warm all year round, is a\ncomfortable environment for this Pokémon.\nSometimes you’ll even see it outside of deserts.
552	Krokorok really hates it when its body gets\ncold. On nights when the temperature drops,\nit digs deep into the desert sands.
553	When it spots prey, even at a distance of over\n30 miles, it swims through the desert as if it\nwere water, then jumps out and chomps them.
554	
555	
556	
557	
558	
559	They move in small groups, walking around lazily.\nAnyone who makes eye contact gets smacked\nwith a headbutt.
560	This Pokémon may be rude, but it takes very\ngood care of its family, its friends, and its turf.
561	
562	
563	
564	It was restored from an ancient fossil. Tirtouga\nlived in the sea but came up onto the land to\nsearch for prey.
565	Its jaws are terrifyingly powerful. It could eat\nOmastar and Omanyte whole and not be\nbothered in the slightest by their shells.
566	Once thought to be the ancestor of all bird\nPokémon, some of the latest research suggests\nthat may not be the case.
567	This ancient Pokémon’s plumage is delicate,\nso if anyone other than an experienced\nprofessional tries to restore it, they will fail.
568	Poisonous gas leaks out of it when it breathes.\nMuk that catch a whiff of that stench will\ncome drooling.
569	It locks opponents in place with its left hand,\nimmobilizing them by entirely dousing their\nbodies with poisonous liquid.
570	This Pokémon has a cowardly disposition, so\nwhen it’s not around friends, it basically\nalways stays transformed as something else.
571	It doesn’t just transform itself—it also has the\npower to make hundreds of people see\nits illusions.
572	A clean freak that will not allow even the\nslightest mess, it uses its tail like a mop to\nthoroughly clean any and all filth.
573	The white parts of its coat are covered in an oil\nsecreted from its body, so this Pokémon can\nslide right away from its enemies’ attacks.
574	
575	
576	
577	
578	
579	
580	
581	
582	It exhales cold air that is at –58 degrees\nFahrenheit. When it’s in a warm place, it shrinks\nlittle by little.
583	It sprays its enemies with grains of ice to freeze\nthem. Most Vanillish in Alola are smaller\nthan average.
584	It blasts blizzards from its two mouths. It can\ncreate snow anywhere, so it gets a lot of love\nfrom skiers and snowboarders.
585	
586	
587	They store up electricity to fly through the air.\nWhen thunder cracks at night, sometimes there\nare almost enough of them to blot out the sky.
588	
589	
590

726	It can act spoiled if it grows close to its Trainer.\nA powerful Pokémon, its sharp claws can leave\nits Trainer’s whole body covered in scratches.

736	If you find its nest, you shouldn’t stick your\nhand inside. You’ll get bitten by an\nirritated Grubbin.
737	It buries itself in fallen leaves and barely\nmoves, munching away on humus. If you\naccidentally step on one, you’ll get a shock!
738	It has an organ that generates electricity in its\nabdomen. It concentrates energy in its strong\njaws and fires off powerful jolts of electricity.
739	Its hard pincers are well suited to both offense\nand defense. Fights between two Crabrawler\nare like boxing matches.
740	It stores coldness in its pincers and pummels its\nfoes. It can even smash thick walls of ice\nto bits!
741	It wins the hearts of its enemies with its\npassionate dancing and then uses the opening\nit creates to burn them up with blazing flames.
742	Nectar and pollen are its favorite fare. In fields\nof flowers, it gets into skirmishes with\nButterfree over food.
743	Rain makes pollen damp, so Ribombee hates\nrain. When it sees ominous clouds, it finds a\nhollow in a tree, where it waits stock-still.
744	As they develop, their disposition grows more\nviolent and aggressive. Many Trainers find them\ntoo much to handle and abandon them.
745	The sharp rocks in its mane can cut like knives.\nLycanroc wears its prey down by degrees\nbefore finishing them off.
746	They’re weak, so they move in schools.\nHowever, they can also often be seen all alone,\nhaving strayed from the school.

756	It puts its prey to sleep and siphons off their\nvitality through the tip of its arms. If one of its\nkind is weakened, it helps by sending it vitality.
757	The males will do whatever the females tell\nthem. They give the females most of their food.\nDue to malnutrition, the males can’t evolve.
758	Salazzle lives deep in caves and forces the\nSalandit it has attracted with its pheromones\nto serve it.
759	It boasts power enough to split large trees in\nhalf. The organ on its rear releases an odor that\nit uses to communicate with others of its kind.

10	Its body is soft and weak. In nature, its\nperpetual fate is to be seen by others as food.
11	Its hard shell doesn’t crack a bit even if Pikipek\npecks at it, but it will tip over, spilling out\nits insides.
12	Nectar from pretty flowers is its favorite food.\nIn fields of flowers, it has heated battles with\nCutiefly for territory.

19	This Pokémon is common but hazardous. Its\nsharp incisors can easily cut right through\nhard wood.
20	Its whiskers are essential for maintaining its\nbalance. No matter how friendly you are, it will\nget angry and bite you if you touch its whiskers.
21	Due to its short wings, it can’t fly long\ndistances. It wanders about restlessly and\npecks at bug Pokémon.
22	In Alola, fish Pokémon are its prey. It can be\nseen circling above the ocean searching\nfor food.
23	The eggs of bird Pokémon are its favorite food.\nIt swallows eggs whole, so sometimes an egg\ngets stuck, and Ekans faints.
24	After stunning its opponents with the pattern\non its stomach, it quickly wraps them up in its\nbody and waits for them to stop moving.
25	While sleeping, it generates electricity in the\nsacs in its cheeks. If it’s not getting enough\nsleep, it will be able to use only weak electricity.
26	Because so many Trainers like the way Pikachu\nlooks, you don’t see this Pokémon very often.
27	When its skin gets wrinkled from moisture, it\nheads for a volcano. It lies flat on a spot with a\nlot of geothermal heat and dries itself out.
28	Thanks to its thick claws, it’s good at climbing\ntrees. There are plenty of Sandslash that park\nthemselves in trees and go right to sleep.

35	Bathed in moonlight, its wings glow faintly.\nWithout even flapping, Clefairy rises into the air,\nwhere it dances around.
36	Some scientists believe that it gazes intently at\nthe sky on nights with a full moon because\nit’s homesick.
37	It manipulates balls of fire to catch its prey.\nIf you raise one from when it’s young, it will\ngrow close to you like a puppy Pokémon.
38	The flickering flames it spews from its mouth\nleave its opponents hypnotized. Then, this\nextremely intelligent Pokémon attacks.
39	The songs they sing are totally different\ndepending on the region they live in. Some even\nsound like they’re shouting!
40	When it gets angry, it inhales with all its might,\nand its body gradually inflates. Sometimes they\ncan grow 20 times larger!
41	Their skin is so thin that they’ll be burned if\nsunlight hits them. When it gets cold out, they\ngather together to warm one another’s bodies.
42	They can suck down over 10 ounces of blood in\none go. They have been known to drink so much\nblood that they can no longer fly.
43	
44	
45	
46	The mushrooms, known as tochukaso, are\ncontrolling the bug. Even if the bug bugs the\nmushrooms, they tell it to bug off.
47	Its poisonous spores are also used in traditional\nmedicine. Apparently, spores produced in Alola\nare not of very good quality.
48	
49	
50	Around their crops, farmers plant the kind of\ntree that Diglett like to eat as a way of getting\nDiglett to plow the fields for them.
51	Dugtrio’s heads are sleek and smooth and\nincredibly hard. It can dig through any soil with\nits headbutts.
52	It loves coins, so if you give it one, you can\nmake friends with Meowth easily. But it’s fickle,\nso you can’t count on that friendship lasting.
53	This Pokémon is popular with rich people.\nIt’s also targeted by hunters who are after\nthe jewel in its forehead.
54	It has been found that its brain cells are\n10 times more active when Psyduck is\nexperiencing a headache.
55	A professional swimmer, it can continue\nswimming for two days straight by waving its\nlong tail skillfully.
56	If one gets angry, all the others around it will\nget angry, so silence is a rare visitor in a troop\nof Mankey.
57	The blood vessels in its brain are sturdier than\nthose of other Pokémon, so it can stay healthy\ndespite its constant raging.
58	It has lived alongside humans since ages ago.\nIts bones have been found in excavations of\nruins from the Stone Age.
59	There are so many old tales about them that\nthey’re called legendary Pokémon, but there are\nway more of them around than you’d expect.
60	The direction of the swirl on their stomachs\ndiffers depending on where they live. Poliwag\naficionados can tell them apart at a glance.
61	Its health suffers when its skin dries out, so be\nsure to moisturize it diligently.
62	The muscles it has developed through swimming\nare thick and powerful. When it lands a square\npunch, it can turn huge boulders to dust.
63	It can read others’ minds and will teleport away\nwhen danger approaches. You must clear your\nmind if you want to catch it.
64	It possesses strong mental capabilities, but its\npsychic powers are halved when it’s not\nholding a silver spoon.
65	If it trusts someone deeply, it will let them have\none of its spoons. Anything you eat with that\nspoon is apparently delicious.
66	It likes food that’s highly nutritious because its\ninstincts drive it to build muscle efficiently.
67	A popular motif for sculptures, its incredibly\nwell-developed muscles have captured the\nimagination of many an artist.

69	
70	
71	
72	Its body is 99% water. The remaining 1%\ncontains the organ that makes its poison.

74	It uses both hands to climb precipitous cliffs.\nPeople who see it in action have been known to\ntake up bouldering.
75	It travels by rolling down cliffs. If it falls into a\nriver, it will explode with its last gasp.
76	It detonates its own body. The power from\nthat explosion can propel it up steep mountain\npaths with amazing speed.
77	
78	
79	Although their tails, which fall off naturally, can\neasily be found lying around, they’re a precious\ningredient for cooking.
80	Shellder, in its greed to suck out more and more\nsweetness from Slowbro’s tail, has\nmetamorphosed into a spiral-shaped shell.
81	Perhaps because electrical lines are often\nburied these days, the number of Magnemite\nattacks on power plants has increased.
82	When rain clouds form, many Magneton gather\nin high places to wait for lightning to strike.
83	
84	
85	
86	Thanks to its thick fat, cold seas don’t bother it\nat all, but it gets tired pretty easily in\nwarm waters.
87	It sunbathes on the beach after meals. The rise\nin its body temperature helps its digestion.
88	The wastewater coming from factories is clean\nthese days, so Grimer have nothing to eat.\nThey’re said to be on the verge of extinction.
89	Because they scatter germs everywhere,\nthey’ve long been targeted for extermination,\nleading to a steep decline in their population.
90	Even when its shell is closed, its tongue still\nhangs out. If you give its tongue a good yank,\nthe shock will cause Shellder to open its shell.
91	Slowpoke tails are its favorite food. It has even\nbeen known to come up on land to look for\nSlowpoke from time to time.
92	Poisonous gas comprises 95% of its body. It’s\nsaid that the remaining 5% is made up of the\nsouls of those who died from the gas.
93	It’s dangerous to go outside alone on nights\nwhen you’re feeling sad. Haunter will catch you,\nand you won’t be able to go back home.
94	Even your home isn’t safe. Gengar will lurk in\nwhatever dark corner of a room it can find and\nwait for its chance to catch its prey.
95	
96	It puts its prey to sleep and devours their\ndreams. It seems that bad dreams taste sour,\nso Drowzee doesn’t particularly like eating them.
97	There are some Hypno that assist doctors with\npatients who can’t sleep at night in hospitals.
98	
99	
100	
101	
102	Although they are the same size as other\nExeggcute, the ones produced in Alola are quite\nheavy. Their shells are packed full.
103	Each of its three heads has its own thoughts.\nWhen they want to go in different directions,\nExeggutor becomes unable to move.
104	It wears its mother’s skull on its head, so no\none knows what its bare face looks like.\nHowever, it’s clear that it’s always crying.
105	They thump their bones rhythmically to\ncommunicate among themselves. There are\nnearly 50 different rhythmic patterns.
106	
107	
108	It licks filth clean with its tongue. Whatever it\nlicks always stinks afterward, so whether it’s\nreally clean is...questionable.
109	
110	
111	
112	
113	Because the eggs on their bellies have been\noverharvested by people in the past, the\nChansey population remains very small.
114	
115	You shouldn’t get close to the child when it’s\nplaying outside its mother’s pouch. Its mother is\nalways nearby watching over it.
116	
117	
118	The way it swims along fluttering its dress-like\nfins has earned it the name “princess of\nthe water.”
119	To attract females, males dance on the river’s\nfloor. The females gather around the male that\ndances most gracefully.
120	No number of injuries can bother Staryu. Its\namazing regenerative powers return it to its\nprevious state in half a day!
121	It rotates its geometrically shaped body to swim\nthrough the water. It always seems to be\nsending out mysterious radio waves.
122	It creates invisible walls with its pantomiming.\nIf you don’t act impressed, it will attack you\nwith a double slap!
123	Some call it a ninja. Its movements—\nimperceptibly quick—are sufficient to cleave\nthe air in two. It’s very popular in Alola.
124	Its strange cries sound like human language.\nThere are some musicians who compose songs\nfor Jynx to sing.
125	While it’s often blamed for power outages, the\ntruth is the cause of outages is more often\nan error on the part of the electric company.
126	The hotter the place, the better they feel.\nMagmar in Alola are said to be hardier than\nthose in other areas.
127	Although it’s tough, it can’t handle cold well.\nWhen night falls, it buries itself in leafage\nand sleeps.
128	The climate seems to be related to the reason\nTauros in Alola are a little calmer than those in\nother regions.
129	Thanks to their strong hold on life, dirty water\ndoesn’t bother them at all. They live in waters\nall over the world!
130	The energy from evolution stimulated its brain\ncells strongly, causing it to become\nvery ferocious.
131	They’ve been so cherished that there’s now an\noverabundance. The fish Pokémon population\nhas declined in waters with too many Lapras.
132	It transforms into whatever it sees. If the thing\nit’s transforming into isn’t right in front of it,\nDitto relies on its memory—so sometimes it fails.
133	Its genes are easily influenced by its\nsurroundings. Even its face starts to look like\nthat of its Trainer.
134	It detects nearby moisture with its fin. When its\nfin begins trembling rapidly, that means rain will\nfall in a few hours.
135	Its fur stands on end, becoming like needles\nit fires at enemies. Once they’re weakened, it\nfinishes them off with a 10,000 volt shock.
136	The flame chamber inside its body ignites when\nFlareon gets agitated, reaching temperatures of\nup to 1,650 degrees Fahrenheit.
137	It was built 20 years ago by scientists who\ndreamed of exploring space. Their dreams have\nyet to come true.
138	It was restored from an ancient fossil. Those\nHelix Fossils are excavated from areas that\nwere once oceans long, long ago.
139	It wraps its prey in its tentacles to immobilize\nthem and then finishes them off with its\nsharp fangs.
140	This Pokémon became extinct everywhere,\nexcept in a few areas. It protects itself with its\nhard shell.
141	It swims at speeds of roughly 29 knots, quickly\nclosing in on its prey and slashing into them\nwith its scythes to finish them off.
142	It flew through the open skies over the ancient\ncontinent as if they were its own. When it\ntouched ground, its walk was weak and slow.
143	It has no interest in anything other than eating.\nEven if you climb up on its stomach while it’s\nnapping, it doesn’t seem to mind at all!
144	
145	
146	
147	It sheds its skin—almost on a daily basis—and\ngrows larger. Its skin is soft just after it’s\nbeen shed.
148	Some say that if you see it at the start of the\nyear, flying through the sky and twisting its\nbody, you’ll be healthy all year long.
149	You’ll often hear tales of this kindhearted\nPokémon rescuing people or Pokémon that\nare drowning.

163	It cries out at the same time every day. A long\ntime ago, people cherished it and considered it\na divine messenger sent to tell the time.
164	When it turns its head entirely upside down,\nyou know it’s troubled by something. If you don’t\nleave it be, it will peck you.
165	These very cowardly Pokémon join together and\nuse Reflect to protect their nest.
166	It flies through the night sky, sprinkling sparkly\ndust. According to some, if that dust sticks to\nyou, good things will happen to you.
167	Although the poison from its fangs isn’t that\nstrong, it’s potent enough to weaken prey that\ngets caught in its web.
168	It spews threads from its mouth to catch its\nprey. When night falls, it leaves its web to go\nhunt aggressively.
169	It feeds on the blood of living people and\nPokémon. If it can’t drink any blood for even a\nshort while, it becomes weak and unable to fly.
170	Chinchou blink their shining antennae at one\nanother to claim their respective turf.
171	It lives far down in the depths of the ocean. It\nblinds its prey with light, using the moment\nthey’re dazzled to swallow them whole.
172	It has electric sacs in its cheeks. When they’re\nfully charged, Pichu plays very energetically.
173	Said to have ridden here on a shooting star,\nCleffa seem to appear in places where\nmeteorites have struck in the past.
174	Left to its own devices, it will constantly\npractice singing. You should make it take a\nbreak so it doesn’t hurt its throat.
175	
176	
177	The look in its eyes gives the impression that\nit’s carefully observing you. If you approach it,\nNatu will hop away.
178	While it can see the future, it has no desire to\nchange it, which is probably why it remains\nmotionless at all times.
179	Rubbing its fleece generates electricity.\nYou’ll want to pet it because it’s cute, but if you\nuse your bare hand, you’ll get a painful shock.
180	It stores electricity in its fluffy fleece. If it\nstores up too much, it will start to go bald in\nthose patches.
181	Its tail shines bright and strong. It has been\nprized since long ago as a beacon for sailors.
182	
183	
184	
185	The result of its holding the same pose all the\ntime is arms that have become supple\nyet strong.
186	The longer and more luxurious the curled hair on\nits head, the greater the number of Poliwag and\nPoliwhirl that will obey it.
187	
188	
189	
190	It searches for prey from the tops of trees.\nWhen it spots its favorite food, Bounsweet,\nAipom gets excited and pounces.
191	
192	
193	
194	
195	
196	Psychic power builds up in the orb on its\nforehead as it bathes in the sunshine. Espeon is\nnot good at battling at night.
197	It lurks in the dark of night looking for prey.\nAt the moment it pounces, the rings on its\nbody glow dimly but ominously.
198	It searches for shiny things for its boss.\nMurkrow’s presence is said to be unlucky, so\nmany people detest it.
199	It’s called “the sage of the sea.” It engages in\nbattles of wits with Oranguru, but the result is\nusually a draw.
200	What makes it happy is imitating the voices of\nweeping people and scaring everyone. It doesn’t\ndeal well with folks who aren’t easily frightened.
201	
202	
203	
204	It sticks tree bark to itself with its saliva,\nmaking itself thicker and larger. Elderly Pineco\nare ridiculously huge.
205	In the moment that it gulps down its prey, the\ninside of its shell is exposed, but to this day,\nno one has ever seen that sight.
206	When it sees a person, it digs a hole with its tail\nto make its escape. If you happen to find one,\nconsider yourself lucky.
207	
208	
209	In contrast to its appearance, it’s quite\ntimid. When playing with other puppy\nPokémon, it sometimes gets bullied.
210	Although it’s popular with young people,\nGranbull is timid and sensitive, so it’s totally\nincompetent as a watchdog.
211	
212	Once it has identified something as an enemy, it\nwill continue beating them with its steel-hard\npincers until there’s nothing left but scraps.
213	
214	It roams through forests searching for sweet\nnectar. Although it boasts fantastic physical\nstrength, it’s not that good at flying.
215	It blends into the dark of night to ambush its\nprey. Sneasel will attack Sandshrew, but its\nhard skin can cause Sneasel’s claws to snap off.
216	
217	
218

221	
222	In Alola, where their natural enemies Mareanie\nare plentiful, many Corsola have stubby\nbranches on their heads.
223	Also known as the “sniper of the seas,”\nits water gun can hit prey without fail from\nover 300 feet away.
224	It usually sleeps in caves. The pitch-black ink\nthat Octillery spits is also used for cooking.
225	It wraps food in its tail to carry it around.\nThe Delibird with the biggest tail is the boss\nof the flock!
226	Many people have taken up surfing because\nthey admire how magnificently Mantine swims.
227	Its body is draped in steel armor. It looks heavy,\nbut it can fly at speeds of up to 185 miles\nan hour!
228	They make repeated eerie howls before dawn\nto call attention to their pack.
229	Identifiable by its eerie howls, people a long\ntime ago thought it was the grim reaper and\nfeared it.
230	
231	
232	
233	Even though it doesn’t die in the vacuum of\nspace, it can’t move around very well in\nzero gravity.
234	
235	It draws symbols with the fluid that oozes from\nthe tip of its tail. Depending on the symbol,\nSmeargle fanatics will pay big money for them.
236	
237	
238	Highly perceptive sensors, Smoochum’s lips are\nkept moist by its daily application of tree sap.
239	When its horns shine a bluish white, that’s the\nsign it’s fully charged. You’ll get a shocking\njolt if you touch it!
240	Its body temperature is always around 1,100\ndegrees Fahrenheit. If Magby falls into a small-\nenough pond, the whole thing will dry up.
241	Its milk is delicious and chock-full of nutrients.\nHowever, if you drink too much, it could make\nyour stomach hurt, so be careful.
242	This Pokémon is overflowing with love. Only\nChansey that share a strong bond with their\nTrainer can evolve, so people say.
243	
244	
245	
246	Raised on nutrients it finds in the dirt, it eats\nroughly a mountain’s worth of dirt before\nit becomes a pupa.
247	This dangerous pupa thrashes about. Its shell is\nas hard as bedrock, containing its gradually\nforming new body within.
248	This Pokémon is a mobile disaster, leaving\nmountains crumbled and houses destroyed in\nits wake.

277	
278	It builds nests in cliffs by the sea. It circles the\nskies above the ocean looking for its favorite\nfood—Wishiwashi.
279	It scoops up Wishiwashi in its huge beak and\nswallows them whole. It can devour more than\n30 at one go!
280	
281	
282	
283	It lives in ponds and marshes that feature lots\nof plant life. It often fights with Dewpider,\nwhose habitat and diet are similar.
284	Its thin, winglike antennae are highly absorbent.\nIt waits out rainy days in tree hollows.

296	There’s a rumor of a traditional recipe for stew\nthat Trainers can use to raise strong Makuhita.
297	Hariyama that are big and fat aren’t necessarily\nstrong. There are some small ones that move\nnimbly and use moves skillfully.
298	
299	It hunts without twitching a muscle by pulling in\nits prey with powerful magnetism. But\nsometimes it pulls natural enemies in close.
300	
301	
302	Materials from gems it has eaten float to the\nsurface of its body and can form an infinite\nnumber of patterns among individuals.
303	It has two mouths. The big jaws on the back of\nits head can’t taste anything, so that’s the\nmouth it uses to eat foods it doesn’t like.
304	
305	
306	
307	
308	
309	Static electricity builds up all over its body\nas strands of its long fur rub together. This\nPokémon boasts incredible speed.
310	It stimulates its own muscles with electricity, so\nit can move quickly. It eases its soreness with\nelectricity, too, so it can recover quickly as well.
311	
312	
313	
314	
315	
316	
317	
318	With its sturdy jaws and fangs, it can easily\nchomp wooden boats to splinters. It fights with\nBasculin over food.
319	It drinks in seawater and jets it from its rear to\npropel itself. It’s very sensitive to the scent\nof blood.
320	Due to their memories of when they once lived\non land, pods of them will, very rarely, wash up\non shore.
321	When a small Wailmer is attacked by Sharpedo\nor Dhelmise, its whole pod works together to\nprotect it.
322	
323	
324	It burns coal to produce energy. When it has\nburned through all of its coal, it becomes unable\nto move.
325	
326	
327	Each Spinda’s spot pattern is different. With its\nstumbling movements, it evades opponents’\nattacks brilliantly!
328	It builds nests that double as traps, lying in\nwait for its prey to get caught. When night falls,\nit digs itself a spot beneath the sand to sleep.
329	It vibrates its wings to send out odd sound\nwaves. Trainers who are with it need earplugs.
330	People continue to have their hearts stolen by\nits enchanting songs and find themselves\nstranded in the desert.
331	
332	
333	
334	
335	
336	
337	
338	
339	Its whiskers are filled with nerves. They can\nsense smells and flavors just as a person’s nose\nor tongue would.
340	Its vision is not that good. It senses vibrations in\nthe water with its whiskers to determine the\nlocation of its prey.
341	It can adapt very well to its environment.\nFeebas and Corphish are about the only\nPokémon to live in stagnant ditches.
342	Its pincers often fall off. Unlike with Crabrawler\nor Clauncher, the meat in its claws is utterly\nnasty and stinking.
343	When they find others of their kind, they cry\nout loudly and gather together. Large numbers\nof them can be found in old graveyards.
344	The ancient people who made it apparently\nmodeled it after something that descended\nfrom the sky. It fires beams from both arms.
345	It sticks to rocks with its powerful suckers and\ncan’t be washed away no matter how rough the\nsurf gets.
346	This carnivorous Pokémon lived in primordial\nseas. It catches prey in its eight tentacles and\ndissolves them with digestive fluid as it eats.
347	This is one kind of primeval bug Pokémon.\nWith eight wings, it could apparently swim\na lot faster than you’d expect.
348	Armaldo adapted from living in water to living on\nland. It has been determined that it is the\nancestor of some bug Pokémon.
349	Because of its wretched appearance, most\npeople pay it no attention, but there are some\nwho collect Feebas—and Feebas alone!
350	Its dwelling place is the bottom of big lakes.\nThose who behold its loveliness are said to\nhave their hearts purified.
351	Its form changes depending on the weather.\nThe rougher conditions get, the rougher\nCastform’s disposition!
352	Its color changes for concealment and also\nwhen its mood or health changes. The darker\nthe color, the healthier it is.
353	There’s a proverb that says, “Shun the house\nwhere Shuppet gather in the growing dusk.”
354	Resentment at being cast off made it spring into\nbeing. Some say that treating it well will satisfy\nit, and it will once more become a stuffed toy.
355	
356	
357	Bunches of delicious fruit grow around its neck.\nIn warm areas, many ranches raise Tropius.
358	
359	The elderly call it the disaster Pokémon and\ndetest it, but interest in its power to predict\ndisasters is on the rise.
360	
361	Rich people from cold areas all share childhood\nmemories of playing with Snorunt.
362	Its actual body is a rock that isn’t particularly\nhard. Glalie absorbs moisture from the air and\ndrapes itself in an armor of ice.
363	
364	
365	
366	Clamperl’s pearls are exceedingly precious.\nThey can be more than 10 times as costly\nas Shellder’s pearls.
367	Deep seas are their habitat. According to\ntradition, when Huntail wash up onshore,\nsomething unfortunate will happen.
368	It sucks bodily fluids out of its prey. The\nleftover meat sinks to the seafloor, where it\nbecomes food for other Pokémon.
369	The reason it hasn’t changed at all in a hundred\nmillion years is that it’s apparently already a\nperfect life-form.
370	Luvdisc makes its home in coral reefs in warm\nseas. It especially likes sleeping in the space\nbetween Corsola’s branches.
371	Some theories suggest that its behavior\nof forcefully bashing its head into things\nstimulates cells that affect its evolution.
372	Shelgon lives deep within caves. It stays shut\nup in its hard shell, dreaming of the day it will\nbe able to fly.
373	Thanks to its fervent wishes, the cells in its\nbody finally mutated, and at last it has its\nheart’s desire—wings.
374	If you anger it, it will do more than rampage. It\nwill also burst out strong magnetism, causing\nnearby machines to break.
375	It flies at high speeds around the skies. When it\nfinds its prey, Metang takes a firm grip with its\nsharp claws and never lets go.
376	It analyzes its opponents with more accuracy\nthan a supercomputer, which enables it to\ncalmly back them into a corner.

407	
408	Its hard skull is its distinguishing feature. It\nsnapped trees by headbutting them, and then\nit fed on their ripe berries.
409	This ancient Pokémon used headbutts skillfully.\nIts brain was really small, so some theories\nsuggest that its stupidity led to its extinction.
410	Although its fossils can be found in layers of\nprimeval rock, nothing but its face has ever\nbeen discovered.
411	This Pokémon is from roughly 100 million years\nago. Its terrifyingly tough face is harder\nthan steel.

422	When it senses danger, a purple liquid oozes out\nof it. The liquid is thought to be something like\ngreasy sweat.
423	Their shape and color change, depending on\ntheir environment and diet. There are many of\nthem at beaches where the waves are calm.
424	It uses its tails for everything. If it wraps both\nof its tails around you and gives you a squeeze,\nthat’s proof it really likes you.
425	Wandering souls gathered together to form this\nPokémon. When trying to make friends with\nchildren, Drifloon grabs them by the hand.
426	The raw material for the gas inside its body\nis souls. When its body starts to deflate, it’s\nthought to carry away people and Pokémon.
427	The reason it keeps one ear rolled up is so it\ncan launch a swift counterattack if it’s attacked\nby an enemy.
428	It’s notably wary and has a dislike of fighting,\nbut at the same time, it can deliver powerful\nkicks with its lithe legs.
429	Its muttered curses can cause awful headaches\nor terrifying visions that torment others.
430	Its goons take care of most of the fighting for it.\nThe only time it dirties its own hands is in\ndelivering a final blow to finish off an opponent.
431	
432	
433	
434	
435	
436	
437	
438	If its body gets too damp, it will die. So, in a\nprocess reminiscent of sweating, its eyes\nexpel moisture.
439	When this gifted mimic surprises an opponent,\nMime Jr. feels so happy that it ends up\nforgetting it was imitating something.
440	When it sees something round and white,\nHappiny puts it into the pouch on its stomach. It\nsometimes becomes overloaded and can’t move.
441	
442	
443	Its original home is an area much hotter than\nAlola. If you’re planning to live with one, your\nheating bill will soar.
444	It sheds its skin and gradually grows larger. Its\nscales can be ground into a powder and used\nas raw materials for traditional medicine.
445	Its fine scales don’t just reduce wind\nresistance—their sharp edges also cause injury\nto any opponent who attacks it.
446	Anything that looks edible, Munchlax will go on\nand swallow whole. Its stomach is tough enough\nto handle it even if the food has gone rotten.
447	It uses waves called auras to communicate with\nothers of its kind. It doesn’t make any noise\nduring this time, so its enemies can’t detect it.
448	Lucario reads its opponent’s feelings with its\naura waves. It finds out things it would rather\nnot know, so it gets stressed out easily.
449	
450	
451	
452	
453	
454	
455	
456	It lures in prey with its shining tail fins. It stays\nnear the surface during the day and moves to\nthe depths when night falls.
457	They traverse the deep waters as if crawling\nover the seafloor. The fantastic lights of its\nfins shine like stars in the night sky.
458	Mantyke are friendly toward people and will\napproach boats closely. The patterns on their\nbacks differ depending on their habitat.
459	
460	
461	Thanks to its increased intelligence, scrapping\nover food is a thing of the past. A scratch from\nits claws will give you a case of frostbite!
462	There are still people who believe that this\nPokémon came from outer space. It emanates\na powerful magnetic field.
463	It uses its tongue much more skillfully than its\nhands or its feet. It can deftly pick up a\nsingle small bean with its tongue.
464	
465	
466	A single Electivire can provide enough electricity\nfor all the buildings in a big city for a year.
467	Magmortar takes down its enemies by shooting\nfireballs, which burn them to a blackened crisp.\nIt avoids this method when hunting prey.
468	
469	
470	It gets its nutrition from photosynthesis. It lives\na quiet life deep in forests where clean\nrivers flow.
471	It can instantaneously freeze any moisture\nthat’s around it, creating ice pellets to shoot at\nits prey.
472	
473	
474	A faulty update was added to its programming.\nIts behavior is noticeably strange, so the\nexperiment may have been a failure.
475	
476	It uses three small units to catch prey and\nbattle enemies. The main body mostly just\ngives orders.
477	
478	It’s said that on nights of terrible blizzards, it\ncomes down to human settlements. If you hear\nit knocking at your door, do not open it!

506	This Pokémon is popular with beginners\nbecause it’s intelligent, obedient to its Trainer’s\ncommands, and easy to raise.
507	It has been living with people for so long that\nportrayals of it can be found on the walls of\ncaves from long, long ago.
508	Its fur is long and thick. A long time ago in cold\nregions, every household kept a Stoutland.

523	
524	It was found in a fissure in a layer of exposed\nrock. The material that makes up its body is\ndirt from several hundred years ago.
525	Its orange crystals are lumps of powerful\nenergy. They’re valuable, so Boldore is\nsometimes targeted for them.
526	It absorbs rays of sunlight and shoots out\nenergy. It’s usually lurking deep beneath\nthe surface.

546	When attacked, it expels cotton from its\nbody to create a diversion. The cotton it loses\ngrows back in quickly.
547	Whimsicott doesn’t live in a fixed location. It\nfloats around on whirling winds, appearing all\nover the place to perform its mischief.
548	They prefer clean water and soil. When the\nenvironment they live in turns bad, the whole\nbunch will up and move to a new area.
549	It’s well liked by other Pokémon because of its\nbeauty. The flower on its head needs constant\ncare, or it will soon wither and rot.
550	When a school of Basculin appears in a lake,\neverything else disappears, except for Corphish\nand Crawdaunt. That’s how violent Basculin are.
551	Sandile’s still not good at hunting, so it mostly\neats things that have collapsed in the desert.\nIt’s called “the cleaner of the desert.”
552	It buries some of its prey in the sand to use as\nemergency meals when its hunts\nare unsuccessful.
553	It conceals itself in sandstorms that Flygon\nwhip up and waits patiently for prey to appear.
554	
555	
556	
557	
558	
559	It stretches its saggy skin up to its neck to\nprotect itself. The saggier their skin, the more\nrespect they garner.
560	It taunts its opponents by spitting. It has a\ncertain territory that it never leaves its whole\nlife long.
561	
562	
563	
564	Its hunting grounds encompassed a broad area,\nfrom the land to more than half a mile deep in\nthe ocean.
565	Carracosta eats every last bit of the prey it\ncatches, even the shells and bones, to further\nstrengthen its sturdy shell.
566	Restored from a fossil, this ancient bird\nPokémon has wings but can’t yet fly.
567	Said to be an ancestor of bird Pokémon, the\nmuscles it uses to flap its wings are still weak,\nso it needs a long runway in order to take off.
568	If a young Pokémon or child breathes in the\ntoxic gas that Trubbish belches out, it could be\na life-threatening situation.
569	Some say the reason Garbodor in Alola are a\nlittle stronger than their counterparts elsewhere\nis the presence of Muk, their natural enemy.
570	If a normally talkative child suddenly stops\ntalking, it may have been replaced by Zorua.
571	If it thinks humans are going to discover its den,\nZoroark shows them visions that make them\nwander around in the woods.
572	When its tail has gotten dirty from self-cleaning\nor from cleaning its nest, Minccino spends a\nwhole day washing its tail in clean spring water.
573	The oil that seeps from its body is really\nsmooth. For people troubled by bad skin,\nthis oil is an effective treatment.
574	
575	
576	
577	
578	
579	
580	
581	
582	When the morning sun hit an icicle, it wished not\nto melt, and thus Vanillite was born. At night, it\nburies itself in snow to sleep.
583	This hearty Pokémon survived the Ice Age.\nIt’s incredibly popular in very hot regions.
584	Vanilluxe is born when two Vanillish, half-melted\nby the day’s light, stick to each other and\nfreeze together in the cold return of night.
585	
586	
587	As it flies, it scatters electricity around, so bird\nPokémon keep their distance. That’s why\nEmolga can keep all its food to itself.
588	
589	
590	
591	
592	Using the invisible poison spikes on its veillike\narms and legs, it paralyzes its enemies and\ncauses them to drown.
593	Fishermen are terrified of Jellicent.\nIt’s rumored to drag them into the sea\nand steal their lives away.
594	The reason it helps Pokémon in a weakened\ncondition is that any Pokémon coming after\nthem may also attack Alomomola.

605	This Pokémon is shrouded in mystery. It’s said\nto have appeared from a UFO that fell from the\nsky about 50 years ago.
606	It has strong psychic powers. Using its fingers\nthat flash three different colors, it controls its\nopponents and rewrites their memories.

619	They seclude themselves in the mountains and\ndevote themselves to training. The form of their\nkicks and chops differs from pack to pack.
620	When Mienshao lets out a bizarre wail, you’re in\ndanger. A flurry of kicks and chops too fast to\nsee is about to be unleashed!
621	It infiltrates tunnels that Pokémon like Diglett\nand Dugtrio have dug and quietly waits for prey\nto pass through.
622	Although ancient people apparently built it by\nworking with clay, the source of its energy\nis unclear.
623	When the seal on its chest is removed, it rages\nindiscriminately, turning the whole town around\nit into a mountain of rubble.
624	It follows Bisharp’s orders to a tee when it\nattacks enemies. After slashing an opponent,\nPawniard clangs both of its blades together.
625	It leads a group of Pawniard. Bisharp doesn’t\neven change its expression when it deals\nthe finishing blow to an opponent.
626	
627	Known as a natural-born warrior, soon after its\nhatching, it will challenge its parent to a fight in\norder to gain their acceptance.
628	Known as “the hero of the skies,” this\nPokémon is so proud and so brave that it will\nnever retreat, even when it’s injured.
629	Its healthy appetite leads to visible growth\nspurts. It often has to replace the bones it\nwears as its size increases.
630	It’s always searching for food for Vullaby. When\nit finds a weak Pokémon, Mandibuzz swoops it\nright off to its nest.
631	
632	
633	
634	
635	
636	It protects itself with flame. Long years ago,\npeople believed Larvesta had a nest on the sun.
637	According to legends, it was hatched from a\nflaming cocoon to save people and Pokémon\nthat were suffering from the cold.

661	Its body is always warm. Trainers who live in\ncold areas apparently sleep with it in their bed.
662	Its speed right after takeoff already puts it in\nthe top speed class of all bird Pokémon.
663	Bird Pokémon make up most of its diet.\nIt approaches at high speeds and smacks them\ndown to the ground with its powerful kick.
664	
665	
666	
667	This hot-blooded Pokémon is filled with\ncuriosity. When it gets angry or starts\nfighting, its short mane gets hot.
668	The temperature of its breath is over 10,000\ndegrees Fahrenheit, but Pyroar doesn’t use it on\nits prey. This Pokémon prefers to eat raw meat.
669	Flabébé wears a crown made from pollen it’s\ncollected from its flower. The crown has hidden\nhealing properties.

750	It can trudge mountain roads without rest\nfor three days and three nights, all the while\ndragging a 10-ton load.
751	It can only breathe oxygen that has dissolved in\nwater, so it wears a water bubble on its head\nwhen it walks around on land.

763	A Pokémon with an aggressive personality and\na mastery of kicking, it cackles every time it\nkicks an opponent.

765	Oranguru don’t get along with each other, so\nthey’re always engaging in battles of wits to\ndecide which one is superior.

767	An astonishingly cowardly Pokémon, Wimpod\nwill whir its legs at high speeds to run away if\nanything comes near it.
768	Its claws, which it can extend and retract at\nwill, are its greatest weapons. Golisopod is\nsometimes accompanied by Wimpod.
769	If you build sand mounds when you’re playing,\ndestroy them before you go home, or they\nmay get possessed and become Sandygast.
770	Once it has whipped up a sandstorm to halt\nits opponents in their tracks, this terrifying\nPokémon snatches away their vitality.
771	Its entire body is covered in its own slime. If you\naccidentally step on one, you’ll slip, and it will\nget mad and smack you!
772	There’s danger of its going on a rampage, so its\ntrue power is sealed away beneath its\ncontrol mask.
773	Through the bond it formed with its Trainer, its\nwill was strengthened, and it was able to\ndestroy its control mask.
774	Although its outer shell is uncommonly durable,\nthe shock of falling to the ground smashes the\nshell to smithereens.
775	It remains asleep from birth to death as a result\nof the sedative properties of the leaves that\nform its diet.
776	Its exploding shell poses a real danger but\nis sensitive to moisture. On rainy days,\nTurtonator takes silent refuge in caves.
777	Its capacity to produce electricity is somewhat\nlimited, so it gets charged up by letting lightning\nstrike it!
778	A gust of wind revealed what hides under this\nPokémon’s rag to a passing Trainer, who went\nhome and died painfully that very night.
779	Its skin is thick enough to fend off Mareanie’s\nspikes. With its robust teeth, Bruxish crunches\nup the spikes and eats them.

783	The scales it sheds can be molded and\nprocessed to make pots and pans. They\nconduct heat well, so they’re a popular item.
784	It battles valiantly with its fists, which are\narmored in steel scales. Kommo-o specializes\nin uppercuts.

786	Although called a guardian deity, Tapu Lele is\ndevoid of guilt about its cruel disposition and\ncan be described as nature incarnate.
787	It makes ringing sounds with its tail to let others\nknow where it is, avoiding unneeded conflicts.\nThis guardian deity of Ula’ula controls plants.
788	Although it’s called a guardian deity, terrible\ncalamities sometimes befall those who\nrecklessly approach Tapu Fini.
