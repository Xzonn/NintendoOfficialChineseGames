gam008_step1_00	Chess is a game where you try to corner the\x0d\nopponent's {c[f40428]}king{c[020202]}.
gam008_step1_01	We'll start with the basics: how the {c[f40428]}pawn {c[020202]}moves.
gam008_step1_02	The {c[f40428]}pawn {c[020202]}can move two spaces the first time it moves.\x0d\nOn all turns after that, it moves one space at a time.
gam008_step1_03	Move your {c[f40428]}pawns {c[020202]}and capture two of the opponent's\x0d\npieces!
gam008_step1_04	If you place a piece in a {c[f40428]}red square{c[020202]}, it's in danger of\x0d\ngetting captured.
gam008_step1_05	If an opponent's piece is in a {c[1d00ff]}blue square{c[020202]}, that means\x0d\nyou can capture it!
gam008_step1_06	{c[f40428]}Pawns {c[020202]}are unusual because they can only capture\x0d\npieces diagonally.
gam008_step1_07	The piece you capture must be diagonally in front\x0d\nof you.
gam008_step1_08	Remember, {c[f40428]}pawns {c[020202]}cannot move backward!
gam008_step1_09	All right! Use a {c[f40428]}pawn {c[020202]}to capture one more.
gam008_step1_10	That's two pieces down! You've cleared step one.
gam008_step1_11	Move your {c[f40428]}pawns {c[020202]}to open up a path for the strong\x0d\npieces behind them.
gam008_step1_12	You put them in checkmate! Way to go!
gam008_step1_13	The first of the basics is covered now.
gam008_step1_14	Sure, you lost, but you learned how to use pawns.
gam008_step1_15	Let's move on to the next lesson!
gam008_step1_16	A draw isn't bad for a beginner! Give yourself a pat\x0d\non the back.
gam008_step2_00	Now we'll introduce the {c[f40428]}knight {c[020202]}and {c[f40428]}bishop{c[020202]}.
gam008_step2_01	The {c[f40428]}knight{c[020202]} is an interesting piece that can jump over\x0d\nother pieces!
gam008_step2_02	The {c[f40428]}bishop{c[020202]} can advance as far as it likes in any\x0d\ndiagonal direction.
gam008_step2_03	Move a piece up in order to create a path for\x0d\nthe bishop.
gam008_step2_04	The {c[f40428]}bishop {c[020202]}is ready to go! This piece can move diagonally\x0d\nas far as it likes.
gam008_step2_05	All right! Now capture another piece using either\x0d\na {c[f40428]}knight{c[020202]} or {c[f40428]}bishop{c[020202]}.
gam008_step2_06	You got them both! Nice job clearing Step Two!
gam008_step2_07	The {c[f40428]}bishop{c[020202]} and {c[f40428]}knight{c[020202]} are pieces that can put your\x0d\nopponent on the defensive right from the start.
gam008_step2_08	Incredible! You put them in checkmate!
gam008_step2_09	Well, you lost. But you learned how the {c[f40428]}knight{c[020202]} and\x0d\n{c[f40428]}bishop{c[020202]} move, which is what matters!
gam008_step2_10	On with the next lesson!
gam008_step2_11	A draw is nothing to sneeze at!
gam008_step2_12	Capture two of your opponent's pieces with\x0d\na {c[f40428]}knight{c[020202]} or {c[f40428]}bishop{c[020202]}!
gam008_step3_00	Finally, let's introduce the {c[f40428]}rook{c[020202]} and {c[f40428]}queen{c[020202]}!
gam008_step3_01	The {c[f40428]}rook {c[020202]}can move vertically or horizontally as far as\x0d\nit likes!
gam008_step3_02	The {c[f40428]}queen{c[020202]} is a very powerful piece. It can move\x0d\nvertically, horizontally, or diagonally as far as it likes!
gam008_step3_04	First, move some {c[f40428]}pawns {c[020202]}out of the way, and then move\x0d\na rook and queen once each.
gam008_step3_05	The {c[f40428]}king{c[020202]} is your most important piece.
gam008_step3_06	If you are put in check, you must make sure to defend\x0d\nyour {c[f40428]}king{c[020202]}!
gam008_step3_07	You can move the {c[f40428]}rook {c[020202]}now!
gam008_step3_08	There it goes! Next, let's move the {c[f40428]}queen{c[020202]}.
gam008_step3_09	You can move the {c[f40428]}queen{c[020202]} now!
gam008_step3_10	There it goes! Next, let's move the {c[f40428]}rook{c[020202]}.
gam008_step3_11	They've both been moved now!
gam008_step3_12	Now let's try to get the opponent in {c[f40428]}check{c[020202]}.
gam008_step3_13	{c[f40428]}Check{c[020202]} means that the king is in danger of being\x0d\ncaptured on the next turn.
gam008_step3_14	Going by the threat map, you need to put your\x0d\nopponent's king in a {c[1d00ff]}blue square{c[020202]}.
gam008_step3_15	Congratulations! That's a big step toward becoming\x0d\na better chess player!
gam008_step3_16	In a real match, the challenge is closing off the king's\x0d\nescape route.
gam008_step3_17	Play a real match and go for checkmate!
gam008_step3_18	It's fine that you lost, so long as you understand now\x0d\nhow the rook and queen move.
gam008_step3_19	A draw! That's not half bad.
gam008_step3_20	A checkmate?! We were only looking for a check!\x0d\nWay to go above and beyond!

gam009_step1_00	Shogi is a game where you try to corner your\x0d\nopponent's {c[f40428]}king{c[020202]}.
gam009_step1_01	Protect your king while trying to corner your opponent's!
gam009_step1_02	Try to capture two of your opponent's pieces.
gam009_step1_03	The {c[f40428]}pawn{c[020202]} can move just one space forward.
gam009_step1_04	If you place a piece in a {c[f40428]}red square{c[020202]}, it's in danger of\x0d\ngetting captured.
gam009_step1_05	Squares that are both {c[f40428]}red{c[020202]} and {c[1d00ff]}blue{c[020202]} mean both your own\x0d\nand your opponent's piece are at risk of capture.
gam009_step1_06	If an opponent's piece is in a {c[1d00ff]}blue square{c[020202]}, that means\x0d\nyou can capture it!
gam009_step1_07	All right! Capture one more of your opponent's pieces.
gam009_step1_08	That's two captures! Congratulations!
gam009_step1_09	The {c[f40428]}pawn {c[020202]}is the most basic piece in shogi.
gam009_step1_10	There are many effective ways to place pieces and\x0d\nchange the flow of battle.
gam009_step1_11	Amazing! You checkmated the king.
gam009_step1_12	Keep going! There are more lessons after this one!
gam009_step1_13	Now you know how the pawn moves.
gam009_step1_14	Let's proceed to the next lesson!
gam009_step2_00	Now try to capture five of your opponent's pieces.
gam009_step2_01	Use as many kinds of pieces as you can to do it.
gam009_step2_02	Well done! Now just capture [0] more of your\x0d\nopponent's pieces.
gam009_step2_03	The {c[f40428]}pawns{c[020202]} have very basic moves, but you can use them\x0d\nin all kinds of ways.
gam009_step2_04	The {c[f40428]}rook{c[020202]} is a powerful piece that serves as the\x0d\ncornerstone of your offense.
gam009_step2_05	Leave any diagonal movement to the {c[f40428]}bishop{c[020202]}! It can\x0d\ntravel far across the board.
gam009_step2_06	The {c[f40428]}lance{c[020202]} cannot retreat after advancing. Use it only\x0d\nwhen you have a definite plan in mind.
gam009_step2_07	The {c[f40428]}knight{c[020202]} has very special moves. It can take the\x0d\nopponent by surprise!
gam009_step2_08	The {c[f40428]}silver general{c[020202]} is a well-balanced piece that can be\x0d\nused for both offense and defense.
gam009_step2_09	The {c[f40428]}gold general{c[020202]} is better suited to going on the\x0d\noffensive.
gam009_step2_10	A key to victory is defending your king while eliminating\x0d\nyour opponent's gold generals.
gam009_step2_11	The {c[f40428]}king {c[020202]}is your most important piece. If it gets\x0d\ncornered, you lose.
gam009_step2_12	You captured five pieces! That takes care of Step Two.
gam009_step2_13	Remember your pieces' moves and use them well.
gam009_step2_14	Congratulations! You cornered the opponent's king.
gam009_step2_15	Are you ready to keep going?
gam009_step2_16	Now you know how all the pieces move.
gam009_step2_17	Let's go a little deeper, shall we?
gam009_step3_00	You can use captured pieces as your allies!
gam009_step3_01	This is a major part of what sets it apart from chess.
gam009_step3_02	You can place {c[f40428]}captured pieces{c[020202]} back on the board.
gam009_step3_03	You can use them to defend your king...
gam009_step3_04	Or they can be dropped directly into enemy territory\x0d\nto attack!
gam009_step3_05	Let's try it out now.
gam009_step3_06	Capture five of your opponent's pieces.
gam009_step3_07	Capture [0] more of your opponent's pieces.
gam009_step3_08	Oh, your piece flipped over!
gam009_step3_09	This is called {c[f40428]}promoting{c[020202]}.
gam009_step3_10	You can strengthen your pieces by having them enter\x0d\nyour opponent's territory.
gam009_step3_11	Keep trying to capture your opponent's pieces!
gam009_step3_12	You captured five pieces! That clears Step Three.
gam009_step3_13	Don't forget to put those pieces you captured to work!
gam009_step3_14	Always keep that in mind!
gam009_step3_15	Now, onto the last step!
gam009_step3_16	Congratulations! You cornered the king.
gam009_step3_17	Now, onto the last lesson!
gam009_step3_18	You learned how to use captured pieces.
gam009_step3_19	There's just one more lesson to learn!
gam009_step4_00	Let's apply what we've learned so far.
gam009_step4_02	Use all your pieces to achieve {c[f40428]}check{c[020202]}!
gam009_step4_03	{c[f40428]}Check{c[020202]} means that the king is in danger of being\x0d\ncaptured on the next turn.
gam009_step4_04	Going by the threat map, you need to put your\x0d\nopponent's king in a {c[1d00ff]}blue square{c[020202]}.
gam009_step4_05	Congratulations! How does it feel to make your\x0d\nshogi debut?
gam009_step4_06	Play a real match and go for checkmate!
gam009_step4_07	You put the king in checkmate!
gam009_step4_08	May your real matches go just as smoothly!
gam009_step4_09	You did well!
gam009_step4_10	Next time, aim to put the opponent's king in check!

gam042_stepup_1_01	Mahjong is a game where you try to make a valid hand\x0d\nusing the 14 tiles you're given.
gam042_stepup_1_02	There are two kinds of tiles: {c[f40428]}number tiles{c[020202]}, which have\x0d\nthree suits, and {c[f40428]}honor tiles{c[020202]}.
gam042_stepup_1_05	We'll start by going over the basic flow of the game.
gam042_stepup_1_06	You drew a {c[f40428]}North{c[020202]} tile, so now you have two North tiles.
gam042_stepup_1_07	When discarding tiles, get rid of tiles not adjacent to\x0d\nany number tiles or tiles of which you only have one.
gam042_stepup_1_08	You drew a {c[f40428]}3 of Sticks{c[020202]}, so now you have a run of\x0d\nthree tiles.
gam042_stepup_1_09	Discard a tile that you don't need.
gam042_stepup_1_10	You drew another North, so now you have three\x0d\nNorth tiles.
gam042_stepup_1_11	Discard a tile that you don't need.
gam042_stepup_1_14	Discard a tile that you don't need.
gam042_stepup_1_15	You drew a {c[f40428]}5 of Characters{c[020202]}, so now you have a run\x0d\nof three tiles.
gam042_stepup_1_16	You're now in tenpai! You only need one tile now to\x0d\ncomplete a valid hand.
gam042_stepup_1_17	If you get to tenpai using only tiles that you drew\x0d\nyourself, you can declare a hand called {c[f40428]}Riichi{c[020202]}.
gam042_stepup_1_18	Let's declare Riichi and wait for that last tile!
gam042_stepup_1_19	You drew the tile you needed to complete your hand!\x0d\nNice work!
gam042_stepup_1_20	You have all 14 tiles you need to make a valid hand,\x0d\nso declare {c[ff1d38]}{c[f40428]}tsumo{c[ff1d38]} {c[020202]}to show your hand and win the game!
gam042_stepup_1_21	This is how you play mahjong: try to be the first to\x0d\nmake a valid hand so that you can win that hand.
gam042_stepup_1_23	If your tiles don't make up a valid hand, you can't use\x0d\nit to finish, so be careful.
gam042_stepup_1_24	These are the fundamentals of Riichi mahjong.
gam042_stepup_1_25	In the next lesson, we'll learn about "{c[f40428]}calls{c[020202]}"!
gam042_stepup_2_01	In mahjong, you can sometimes {c[f40428]}take{c[020202]} tiles that your\x0d\nopponents discard!
gam042_stepup_2_02	You can do this with specific {c[f40428]}calls{c[020202]}.
gam042_stepup_2_03	In this lesson, we'll make a valid hand by calling for your\x0d\nopponents' discarded tiles.
gam042_stepup_2_04	The player to your left discarded a tile that you can\x0d\nuse to complete a run.
gam042_stepup_2_05	In this case, you can call "{c[f40428]}chii{c[020202]}" to take that tile.
gam042_stepup_2_06	Taking a tile from the person to your left that can\x0d\ncomplete a run is called "{c[f40428]}chii{c[020202]}."
gam042_stepup_2_07	Discard a tile that you don't need.
gam042_stepup_2_08	The player across from you discarded a tile identical\x0d\nto two tiles you already have in your hand.
gam042_stepup_2_09	In this case, you can call "{c[f40428]}pon{c[020202]}" to take that tile.
gam042_stepup_2_10	Taking a tile that can complete a triplet is called "{c[f40428]}pon{c[020202]}."
gam042_stepup_2_11	"Pon" can be used on any other player's discards.
gam042_stepup_2_12	Discard a tile that you don't need.
gam042_stepup_2_13	The player to your left has discarded an {c[f40428]}8 of Dots{c[020202]}.
gam042_stepup_2_14	With this, you can make a hand called {c[f40428]}All Simples\x0d\n{c[020202]}and finish!
gam042_stepup_2_15	Using an opponent's tile to complete a valid hand and\x0d\nwin the hand is called "{c[f40428]}ron{c[020202]}."
gam042_stepup_2_16	Go ahead and call out "ron" to finish this hand!
gam042_stepup_2_17	Congratulations! Looks like you won the hand!
gam042_stepup_2_18	In mahjong, using tiles discarded by your opponents is\x0d\na very important part of the game!
gam042_stepup_3_01	There are many kinds of hands you can make in mahjong.
gam042_stepup_3_03	In this lesson, let's try to make a special hand called\x0d\n{c[f40428]}Seven Pairs{c[020202]}.
gam042_stepup_3_04	This is a simple hand made up entirely of pairs,\x0d\nso you don't have to worry about memorizing anything.
gam042_stepup_3_05	You need to get {c[f40428]}seven pairs{c[020202]} to make this hand.
gam042_stepup_3_06	(The Japanese name for it, if you were curious,\x0d\nis "chiitoitsu.")
gam042_stepup_3_07	Right now, you have four pairs in your hand.
gam042_stepup_3_08	You drew a {c[f40428]}4 of Characters{c[020202]}, so that makes five pairs.
gam042_stepup_3_09	Discard a tile that you don't need in order to proceed.
gam042_stepup_3_10	You drew a {c[f40428]}6 of Sticks{c[020202]}! You're close now, with six\x0d\npairs in your hand.
gam042_stepup_3_11	You're now in tenpai. That means you only need one\x0d\nmore tile to complete a hand!
gam042_stepup_3_12	Let's declare "Riichi" and wait for that last tile.
gam042_stepup_3_13	Someone discarded the tile that you need! Take it\x0d\nand complete your Seven Pairs hand.
gam042_stepup_3_14	Remember, you call "ron" when using an opponent's tile\x0d\nto complete a valid hand and win.
gam042_stepup_3_15	Time to call out "ron" and finish this hand!
gam042_stepup_3_16	There are many kinds of valid hands in mahjong.
gam042_stepup_3_17	Try to start by aiming for simple hands, such as\x0d\nSeven Pairs, All Simples, and Riichi!
gam042_stepup_3_18	We recommend using the Global Tiles design until\x0d\nyou've got a feel for the tiles.

gam105_list_act_ex00	The bet is when you first risk your chips. Afterward,\x0d\nevery other player must call, raise, or fold.
gam105_list_act_ex01	A player calls when they match the number of chips that\x0d\nwas bet by the player before them.
gam105_list_act_ex02	Raising increases the number of chips you bet by at least\x0d\ntwice the amount of the previous player. Any players still in\x0d\nhave to decide whether or not they'll stay in the game.
gam105_list_act_ex03	You can only check when nobody else has made a bet in\x0d\nthe round yet. If you don't feel good about your cards,\x0d\nbut don't want to fold, pass your turn to the next player\x0d\nwithout betting.
gam105_list_act_ex04	A player who folds gives up on the round and loses any chips\x0d\nalready added to the pot. If everyone folds, the last player\x0d\nremaining wins by default.
gam105_list_act_ex05	When you don't have enough chips to match a call, you can\x0d\nstill play by going "all in," or betting all of your chips.

menu_movie_gam003_03	Not off to a great start here.
menu_movie_gam003_04	I think I've got this in the bag...
menu_movie_gam003_05	I didn't blow it! The wind blew it.

menu_movie_gam004_00	Now that there are no kids around...show me how to\x0d\nplay billiards!
menu_movie_gam004_01	Sure. The basic play is to hit the white cue ball into\x0d\nthe others to sink them.
menu_movie_gam004_02	Don't just explain it. I want you to show me!
menu_movie_gam004_03	Can do. You start with the break shot.
menu_movie_gam004_04	Whoa, nice job! You got two in already.
menu_movie_gam004_05	Yeah, it's pretty normal to get a few in on the break.
menu_movie_gam004_06	Heh... That's normal too.
menu_movie_gam004_07	I'm learning so much!\x0e\x01\x06\x02\x01\xcd My turn now.
menu_movie_gam004_08	I'm guessing that was a bad play.
menu_movie_gam004_09	Hey, it's all part of the learning process.
menu_movie_gam004_10	I think I'll try it from here.
menu_movie_gam004_15	*exert*

menu_movie_gam006_ttm_02	I brought mine too!
menu_movie_gam006_ttm_03	Good. If we all line up our consoles, we can make the\x0d\nlongest course in the neighborhood.
menu_movie_gam006_ttm_05	First, watch what happens when you put them in a line.
menu_movie_gam006_ttm_06	Just gotta swipe my finger here and...

menu_movie_gam007.msbt
menu_movie_gam007_00	Oh... I know this game. 
menu_movie_gam007_01	We have a long and troubled history.
menu_movie_gam007_02	Really? All you gotta do is flip your opponent's pieces\x0d\nby placing yours on either side.
menu_movie_gam007_03	I know, but it feels like I ALWAYS end up losing at the\x0d\nlast minute.
menu_movie_gam007_04	Huh. Are you securing the corners?
menu_movie_gam007_05	The corners? Why?
menu_movie_gam007_06	Ahhh. See, if you take all four corners...
menu_movie_gam007_07	You can flip the script on your opponent!
menu_movie_gam007_08	Ohhhh. All right, Renegade. You have no more power\x0d\nover me!
menu_movie_gam008.msbt
menu_movie_gam008_00	Chess is a game where each player is trying to take\x0d\nthe other's king.
menu_movie_gam008_01	You get to say "checkmate" when that happens, right?
menu_movie_gam008_02	Totally. So each type of piece moves differently,\x0d\nand only the knight can jump over other pieces.
menu_movie_gam008_03	I love the way saying that feels. "Checkmate"...\x0d\n"Checkmate"...
menu_movie_gam008_04	Any other pieces you capture are out of play.
menu_movie_gam008_05	Oh! So it's not like shogi. I'll have to remember that.
menu_movie_gam008_06	Pawns that make it all the way to the other side\x0d\nget a promotion. A pawn can become a queen!
menu_movie_gam008_07	That'll make it easier to get a you-know-what!
menu_movie_gam008_08	Uh-oh.
menu_movie_gam008_09	It's time! I get to say the thing!
menu_movie_gam008_10	*sigh* Yeah, go for it.
menu_movie_gam008_11	{s[120]}*ah-he-hem* Checkmate!{s[100]}
menu_movie_gam008_12	I wish I ever got to say it...
menu_movie_gam008_13	{s[140]}Promotion{s[100]}
menu_movie_gam008_14	Pawns that make it to the opposite side can become\x0d\ndifferent pieces.

menu_movie_gam009_00	I like a good game of chess, but I don't know shogi.
menu_movie_gam009_01	It's a game of war. The ultimate goal...is regicide.
menu_movie_gam009_02	This is the king.
menu_movie_gam009_03	Hm. What are the pieces around him?
menu_movie_gam009_04	His troops. They all move differently.
menu_movie_gam009_05	Ah! Not so different from chess, then.
menu_movie_gam009_06	Ah, but you see, when they breach enemy lines...
menu_movie_gam009_07	They get stronger!
menu_movie_gam009_08	So...only a little bit like chess.
menu_movie_gam009_09	Not only that, but if you capture an enemy piece,\x0d\nit joins your side!
menu_movie_gam009_10	All right, all right, I'll stop comparing it to chess.
menu_movie_gam009_11	There's more to it than that, of course.
menu_movie_gam009_12	There's more?
menu_movie_gam009_13	But don't worry. You'll pick up the finer points once\x0d\nyou play a game or two.

menu_movie_gam012.msbt
menu_movie_gam012_01	Ahhh, nature.
menu_movie_gam012_02	It's good to get away from the grind.
menu_movie_gam012_07	Red alert! You've got a bite!

menu_movie_gam012_ttm_00	Everyone ready to go fishing?
menu_movie_gam012_ttm_01	Yeeeeaaaaah!
menu_movie_gam012_ttm_01_2	Yeeeeaaaaah!
menu_movie_gam012_ttm_01_3	Yeeeeaaaaah!
menu_movie_gam012_ttm_02	You can fish different places depending on how\x0d\nyou line up your consoles.
menu_movie_gam012_ttm_03	Watch—I'll show you what four in a straight line\x0d\nlooks like.
menu_movie_gam012_ttm_04	Just gotta slide this over...
menu_movie_gam012_ttm_05	{s[140]}A river!{s[100]}

menu_movie_gam012_ttm_07_2	{s[140]}A waterfall!{s[100]}

menu_movie_gam012_ttm_10	Look at that huuuge fish over there!
menu_movie_gam012_ttm_11	Huh. So the fish change depending on how you\x0d\nline everything up.
menu_movie_gam012_ttm_12	Anyone wanna see who'll catch the most fish?
menu_movie_gam012_ttm_13	You will...
menu_movie_gam012_ttm_13_2	You will...
menu_movie_gam012_ttm_13_3	You will...
menu_movie_gam013.msbt
menu_movie_gam013_00	The name's Board. Games Board.
menu_movie_gam013_01	None of my targets have ever escaped.
menu_movie_gam013_02	U-uhh...
menu_movie_gam013_03	Aaaaaaaah!
menu_movie_gam013_04	{s[140]}AAAAAAAH!{s[100]}
menu_movie_gam013_05	Maybe I should go back to driving tanks...
menu_movie_gam014.msbt
menu_movie_gam014_00	We gotta slide the panels to make a path for\x0d\nthe turtle.
menu_movie_gam014_01	I bet he appreciates it.
menu_movie_gam014_02	I'll be your navigator!
menu_movie_gam014_03	Oh! Pick up more jewels!
menu_movie_gam014_04	No sweat! 
menu_movie_gam014_05	I can move just one panel, or a whole bunch at once.
menu_movie_gam014_06	Neat. No turtle problems so far!
menu_movie_gam014_07	Uh-oh!
menu_movie_gam014_08	Nooo! Turn back!
menu_movie_gam014_09	Sorry, Mr. Turtle...

menu_movie_gam022.msbt
menu_movie_gam022_11	Wait, that's it?!
menu_movie_gam022_00	Yup.
menu_movie_gam022_01	Come on. You always have SOMETHING to say.
menu_movie_gam022_02	Well...
menu_movie_gam022_03	There are keys, and...\x0e\x01\x06\x02\x01\xcdlittle keys...
menu_movie_gam022_04	Oh, forget it!
menu_movie_gam022_ttm.msbt
menu_movie_gam022_ttm_00	We can do something pretty cool if everyone has\x0d\ntheir consoles.
menu_movie_gam022_ttm_01	How about a bigger piano?!
menu_movie_gam022_ttm_02	All you have to do is slide your finger like so...
menu_movie_gam022_ttm_03	{s[140]}Whoa!{s[100]}
menu_movie_gam022_ttm_03_2	{s[140]}Whoa!{s[100]}
menu_movie_gam022_ttm_03_3	{s[140]}Whoa!{s[100]}
menu_movie_gam022_ttm_04	What should we do with these, though?
menu_movie_gam022_ttm_05	\ue002 Maracas!

menu_movie_gam022_ttm_07	\ue001 Drums!

menu_movie_gam031_00	Wanna play gomoku?
menu_movie_gam031_01	Do I ever!
menu_movie_gam031_02	Oh, is that gomoku? Let me show you kids how to play.
menu_movie_gam031_03	We already know how!
menu_movie_gam031_04	Yeah! The first one to make a line of five in any\x0d\ndirection wins.
menu_movie_gam031_05	Well...yeah. I guess you got it.
menu_movie_gam031_06	I told you we didn't need you to explain!
menu_movie_gam031_07	Yeah! Take a hike!
menu_movie_gam031_08	Uh...
menu_movie_gam031_09	I'll go first!
menu_movie_gam031_10	Oh, if you're going first, then—
menu_movie_gam031_11	I use the black stones. I told you! We GOT this!
menu_movie_gam031_16	Not even a little strategy advice?
menu_movie_gam031_17	Gotcha!
menu_movie_gam031_18	Not so fast!
menu_movie_gam031_19	Huh. I'm...gonna go play solitaire.
menu_movie_gam032.msbt
menu_movie_gam032_00	Long, long ago in a land far away...
menu_movie_gam032_01	The Roman Empire existed.
menu_movie_gam032_02	Roman rulers gathered in the Senate to debate.
menu_movie_gam032_03	There, they would send their proxies out to speak.
menu_movie_gam032_04	If three proxies could line up in a row, they would all\x0d\nshout in unison:
menu_movie_gam032_05	{s[140]}"MILL!"{s[100]}
menu_movie_gam032_06	And everyone agreed that the argument was\x0d\nvery convincing.
menu_movie_gam032_07	Losing orators fled the Senate in disgrace.
menu_movie_gam032_09	Eventually, one senator would concede, having\x0d\ntoo few proxies left to make a case.
menu_movie_gam032_08	But who was Morris, you ask? Ahh...a tale for\x0d\nanother time.
menu_movie_gam032_20	Mill!
menu_movie_gam032_30	Eliminate your rival's pieces!
menu_movie_gam032_31	With two pieces, you can't Mill.
menu_movie_gam033.msbt
menu_movie_gam033_00	Have you come to try and get four in a row before me?
menu_movie_gam033_01	Token Drop Block!
menu_movie_gam033_02	Falling Circle Counter!
menu_movie_gam033_03	Crouching Disc Stance!
menu_movie_gam033_04	Seeds of Future Victory!
menu_movie_gam033_05	Hidden Path Strike!
menu_movie_gam033_06	(I'm so clooose!)
menu_movie_gam033_07	You fought honorably.
menu_movie_gam033_08	We will duel again in winter.
menu_movie_gam034.msbt
menu_movie_gam034_00	Ever played this one before?
menu_movie_gam034_01	Don't think so. Where's the board? And the pieces?
menu_movie_gam034_02	All you need for this one is a pen and paper.
menu_movie_gam034_03	That's it? So I take it the rules aren't too complicated?
menu_movie_gam034_04	There are basically just two. On your turn, you draw\x0d\na line.
menu_movie_gam034_05	When your line finishes a box, you get a point!
menu_movie_gam034_06	Two rules for a 2D game. I'll give it a shot!
menu_movie_gam034_07	What just happened?!
menu_movie_gam034_08	Oh, right. If you finish a box, you get to keep going.
menu_movie_gam034_09	A third dimension...
menu_movie_gam035.msbt
menu_movie_gam035_00	Awww, look at the animals! Cute!
menu_movie_gam035_01	It's not as cute as it looks. The hare is trying to escape\x0d\nthe hunting hounds and get to the other side.
menu_movie_gam035_02	Yikes!
menu_movie_gam035_03	Mhm! The hounds win by blocking the hare's\x0d\nescape route.
menu_movie_gam035_04	Awww, poor bunny! It's all alone against three dogs!
menu_movie_gam035_05	I wouldn't count the hare out just yet.
menu_movie_gam035_06	Only one hound can move on their turn.
menu_movie_gam035_07	And the hounds can't move backward, while the hare\x0d\ncan go wherever it wants.
menu_movie_gam035_08	It's actually pretty tough for the hounds to catch!
menu_movie_gam035_09	Awww, poor doggies!
menu_movie_gam035_10	Now you're on their side?
menu_movie_gam036.msbt
menu_movie_gam036_00	This game's kind of like poker, but with dice\x0d\ninstead of cards.
menu_movie_gam036_01	How you roll plays into which category you aim for.
menu_movie_gam036_02	So...I want to get more points than you in each\x0d\ncategory. Is that the size of it?
menu_movie_gam036_03	Pretty much. Luck, don't fail me now!
menu_movie_gam036_04	*exert*
menu_movie_gam036_05	Huh. The three 1s could be something.
menu_movie_gam036_06	Yeah. I'll keep those and try the other two again.
menu_movie_gam036_07	Fingers crossed!
menu_movie_gam036_08	Nice! There's a fourth 1!
menu_movie_gam036_09	You're on a roll! Heh.
menu_movie_gam036_10	No puns. We talked about this. If I can just get one\x0d\nmore, it'll be a Yacht worth 50 points.
menu_movie_gam036_11	Awww, rats. Didn't get the full set.
menu_movie_gam036_12	So after the third roll, you have to pick a category?
menu_movie_gam036_13	Yeah. Hmm... 4 of a Kind would be worth more\x0d\nhere than Aces.
menu_movie_gam036_14	But this is the weakest 4 of a Kind I could\x0d\nroll, so I'll save that one.
menu_movie_gam036_15	Which means Aces it is.
menu_movie_gam036_16	You really have to think about which category to\x0d\ngo with.
menu_movie_gam036_17	So are you ready to try?
menu_movie_gam036_18	Let the good times roll!
menu_movie_gam036_19	\ue0243 left
menu_movie_gam036_20	\ue0242 left
menu_movie_gam036_21	\ue0241 left

menu_movie_gam037.msbt
menu_movie_gam037_00	Isn't this game old? Like, real old?
menu_movie_gam037_01	It's not old—it's a classic! The object is to go\x0d\naround the board to the other side.
menu_movie_gam037_02	So I'm trying to get here.
menu_movie_gam037_03	And my goal's over there.
menu_movie_gam037_04	Got it. Let's get started!
menu_movie_gam037_05	I'm thinking I'll move this piece three spaces...
menu_movie_gam037_06	And this one can advance five.
menu_movie_gam037_09	A 3, huh? Think I'll just move this piece a little...
menu_movie_gam037_07	You're sending me back AGAIN? This is getting old!
menu_movie_gam037_08	Not old. Classic.
menu_movie_gam037_20	Goal
menu_movie_gam037_21	[Turn Order] Whoever rolls higher goes first.
menu_movie_gam037_22	That player uses the deciding roll on their first turn.
menu_movie_gam037_23	Land on an opponent's piece to send it back!
menu_movie_gam038.msbt
menu_movie_gam038_00	It's slow going, moving one diagonal space at a time.
menu_movie_gam038_01	Then I jump to capture you and it's all for nothing!
menu_movie_gam038_02	*sigh*
menu_movie_gam038_03	I'll capture all your pieces before you know it.
menu_movie_gam038_04	Not if I can reach the other side and get kinged!
menu_movie_gam038_05	That's a verb now?
menu_movie_gam038_06	Wow. Kinged pieces get to move backward too.
menu_movie_gam038_07	Royal privilege is hard-won, but sweet.
menu_movie_gam039.msbt
menu_movie_gam039_00	Whoa. A wide-open field. No one's touched it.
menu_movie_gam039_01	That's where we come in!
menu_movie_gam039_02	My road's gonna stretch from there to there!
menu_movie_gam039_03	Nuh-uh! I'm gonna get from here to here!
menu_movie_gam039_04	Wow, we're gonna ruin this field.
menu_movie_gam039_05	Yeah. But I'll ruin you first!
menu_movie_gam039_06	Quit blocking my road!
menu_movie_gam039_07	Why?! That's the whole game!
menu_movie_gam039_08	Almost there...
menu_movie_gam039_09	Help! Unauthorized building! Block the bulldozers!
menu_movie_gam039_10	Yeah! My road's done! I'm gonna set up a toll on it.
menu_movie_gam039_11	Looks like I lose. Me...and nature.
menu_movie_gam040.msbt
menu_movie_gam040_00	It's time I introduced you all to ludo!
menu_movie_gam040_01	{s[120]}What?!{s[100]}
menu_movie_gam040_01_2	What?!
menu_movie_gam040_01_3	What?!
menu_movie_gam040_02	It's a dice game that was invented in India.
menu_movie_gam040_03	Oh. Whew. I thought you said "judo."
menu_movie_gam040_04	Well, you do toss other players' pieces back to the start\x0d\nif you land on them. 
menu_movie_gam040_05	Maybe there's some judo there.
menu_movie_gam040_06	All the way back to the start?!
menu_movie_gam040_07	Yep! Setting your opponents back is half the fun.
menu_movie_gam040_08	If you say so...
menu_movie_gam040_09	You win by getting all your pieces into your goal.
menu_movie_gam040_10	Sounds easy!
menu_movie_gam040_10_2	Sounds easy!
menu_movie_gam040_11	I'm ready to play if you are!
menu_movie_gam040_12	{s[120]}Let's get him!{s[100]}
menu_movie_gam040_12_2	Let's get him!

menu_movie_gam041_00	This is a three-player game where the object is to\x0d\nrelocate all your marbles.
menu_movie_gam041_01	Moving day!
menu_movie_gam041_01_2	Moving day!
menu_movie_gam041_02	They pack up over here and their new home is\x0d\nover there.
menu_movie_gam041_03	Ooh! If a marble is in my way, I can jump over it.
menu_movie_gam041_04	Right! And if you have room to make another\x0d\njump after that, you can keep jumping!
menu_movie_gam041_05	This is way more fun than real moving day!
menu_movie_gam041_06	Jumpy jumpy jump!
menu_movie_gam041_06_2	Jumpy jumpy jump!
menu_movie_gam041_07	Ha! Careful with those boxes, kids!
menu_movie_gam042.msbt
menu_movie_gam042_00	I know one thing about this game: the pieces go "clack"\x0d\nwhen you put them down.
menu_movie_gam042_01	That's the least useful thing you've ever said.
menu_movie_gam042_02	Sorry. I'm guessing you play using these tiles with the\x0d\ncharacters and pictures on them.
menu_movie_gam042_03	We're using the global version of the tiles, right?\x0d\nThat should help.
menu_movie_gam042_04	Oh, sure enough. It says here we have to make\x0d\nsomething from the 14 tiles that we get.
menu_movie_gam042_05	Make what? Are we trying to get four of a kind?\x0d\nA straight?
menu_movie_gam042_06	Uhh, seems like lots of things will work. The list here\x0d\nhas over 35 hands you can make.
menu_movie_gam042_07	How is anyone supposed to remember all that?!
menu_movie_gam042_08	I've been leaning pretty heavily on the recommended\x0d\nhands in the Assist Mode.
menu_movie_gam042_09	What kind of stuff is in there?
menu_movie_gam042_10	It has a list of hands you can refer to. Also, some tips\x0d\nto help you make them.
menu_movie_gam042_11	Let me in on that action!
menu_movie_gam042_12	Wanna give it a try and see how we do?
menu_movie_gam042_13	I'm game if you are!
menu_movie_gam042_14	Great! It seems pretty deep, so let's stick a toe in and\x0d\nsee how it feels!

menu_movie_gam043_00	This one's fun. You have to get rid of matching\x0d\nmahjong tiles.
menu_movie_gam043_01	But they make such a pretty design.
menu_movie_gam043_02	And we're going to destroy it.
menu_movie_gam043_03	Starting with these two!
menu_movie_gam043_04	Well, if we're doing this...let's do these two next.
menu_movie_gam043_05	Nope, that's not allowed.
menu_movie_gam043_06	Oh, there are rules? Now I'm interested.
menu_movie_gam043_07	You can take tiles only if they're not surrounded on\x0d\neither side and aren't covered by anything.
menu_movie_gam043_08	Pressing this should clear things up.
menu_movie_gam043_09	Oh, so I can't take any of the darkened tiles.\x0d\nI kind of get it now.
menu_movie_gam043_10	Told you. The assist function is really helpful\x0d\nfor beginners.
menu_movie_gam043_11	Beginners. Right. I can turn it off anytime I want.

menu_movie_gam044_00	Hey, this looks {s[140]}WAY{s[100]} easier than regular shogi!
menu_movie_gam044_01	Don't be so sure.
menu_movie_gam044_02	Already?!
menu_movie_gam044_03	I guess without pawns, there's nowhere to hide.
menu_movie_gam044_04	You catch on quick.
menu_movie_gam044_05	This is {s[140]}WAY{s[100]} harder than it looks!
menu_movie_gam044_06	I like to go straight for the kill.

menu_movie_gam045_00	Mancala is all about planting!
menu_movie_gam045_01	Like...seeds?
menu_movie_gam045_02	Oh, I see. You pick up the seeds and drop them in\x0d\ntheir little holes.
menu_movie_gam045_03	You get to choose which of your pockets to move\x0d\nstones from.
menu_movie_gam045_04	And these six pockets are mine?
menu_movie_gam045_05	Yeah! The goal is to collect the most stones in\x0d\nyour store.
menu_movie_gam045_06	Sure. In case of famine.
menu_movie_gam045_07	There's one other twist you should know.
menu_movie_gam045_08	Yeah?
menu_movie_gam045_09	If you drop your last stone in an empty pocket,\x0d\nit's capturing time!
menu_movie_gam045_10	Hey, you can take your opponent's seeds! Nice.
menu_movie_gam045_11	The game ends when one player runs out of stones\x0d\nin their pockets.
menu_movie_gam045_12	So whoever has the most seeds in their store\x0d\nsurvives the winter. I mean, wins the game.
menu_movie_gam045_13	How does it all work, you ask? \x0d\n{s[140]}We'll figure it out as we go!{s[100]}
menu_movie_gam045_14	Said the grasshopper to the ant.

menu_movie_gam046_00	What's all this?
menu_movie_gam046_01	It's a game where you guess at a set of hidden pegs.
menu_movie_gam046_02	Oh, fun!
menu_movie_gam046_03	Here's how it works.
menu_movie_gam046_04	A brown peg means you have the right color in\x0d\nthe right spot. Like a direct "hit."
menu_movie_gam046_05	With you so far.
menu_movie_gam046_06	A white peg means you've got the right color,\x0d\nbut in the wrong place. Or a glancing "blow."
menu_movie_gam046_07	So this means...you have all four colors right,\x0d\nbut only two are in the right place.
menu_movie_gam046_08	Exactly. 
menu_movie_gam046_09	Let's assume red's in the right spot.
menu_movie_gam046_10	What happens if I try...this!
menu_movie_gam046_11	Does that tell us anything?
menu_movie_gam046_12	Um. Well. What about if I switch them around like so?
menu_movie_gam046_13	Ugh, I don't understand...
menu_movie_gam046_14	This is taking forever. Let me try.
menu_movie_gam046_15	I think you were onto something with that red one.
menu_movie_gam046_16	Blue's obviously one of the bottom two, so...\x0d\nlet's put it here.
menu_movie_gam046_17	But we have to make a change somewhere, so I'll\x0d\nswap purple and white.
menu_movie_gam046_18	And voila!
menu_movie_gam046_19	Heh! Not bad, right?
menu_movie_gam046_20	Oh. Uh...way to learn from my mistakes.

menu_movie_gam047_00	We're gonna play dominoes!
menu_movie_gam047_01	You can PLAY dominoes? I just like lining them up.
menu_movie_gam047_02	No, it's a real game. Wanna try it?
menu_movie_gam047_03	Well...
menu_movie_gam047_03_2	Well...
menu_movie_gam047_04	Sure you do! I'll start us off.
menu_movie_gam047_05	If you have a domino with the same number, you can\x0d\nconnect it to that one.
menu_movie_gam047_06	So...one with a 6. Like this?
menu_movie_gam047_20	5 and 5...
menu_movie_gam047_21	4 to 4...
menu_movie_gam047_22	1 goes with 1...
menu_movie_gam047_07	What if you don't have any dominoes that work?
menu_movie_gam047_08	Then you draw one from the pile.
menu_movie_gam047_09	You win by playing all the dominoes in your hand.
menu_movie_gam047_10	Now you tell us?!
menu_movie_gam047_10_2	Now you tell us?!

menu_movie_gam048_02	I'm a January man. Pines and cranes are very\x0d\n"in" now.
menu_movie_gam048_03	Ew. Give me February's plum blossoms and\x0d\nnightingales any day.
menu_movie_gam048_04	Whatever month you like, each one has four cards.
menu_movie_gam048_05	Some cards are DEFINITELY better than others.\x0d\nNot naming names here. You know who you are.
menu_movie_gam048_06	We're looking to match cards from the same month.
menu_movie_gam048_07	Certain cards make special sets for more points!

menu_movie_gam048_09	Sure.
menu_movie_gam048_10	Check out the December Paulownia card.

menu_movie_gam051_02	Nyugh!
menu_movie_gam051_03	Just gotta...hang in there...

menu_movie_gam052_00	Carrom is an Indian game that's a little bit like marbles.
menu_movie_gam052_01	The object is to sink your carrom men—that's those\x0d\ncoins—into the pockets.
menu_movie_gam052_02	That doesn't sound much like marbles.
menu_movie_gam052_03	This is the striker, right?
menu_movie_gam052_04	Right. You pull back from behind this line to shoot.
menu_movie_gam052_05	So I'm playing white, huh? Here goes!
menu_movie_gam052_06	Good break! Now it's my turn.
menu_movie_gam052_07	This one's not either of our colors. What happens\x0d\nif I pocket it?
menu_movie_gam052_08	Oh, that's the queen. 
menu_movie_gam052_09	The way you win is by pocketing it before you\x0d\npocket your last coin.
menu_movie_gam052_10	A queen! Like in chess! I'm gonna go for that one.
menu_movie_gam052_11	Nyugh!
menu_movie_gam052_12	Got it!
menu_movie_gam052_13	Great job!
menu_movie_gam052_14	Now you have to cover her escape by pocketing\x0d\none of your own coins.
menu_movie_gam052_15	No problem!
menu_movie_gam052_16	Nyugh!
menu_movie_gam052_17	Made it! I win!
menu_movie_gam052_18	Way to go!
menu_movie_gam052_19	But, um...
menu_movie_gam052_20	What's up?
menu_movie_gam052_21	I feel bad that you got such a low score.
menu_movie_gam052_22	That's OK. I'll pretend we were playing golf.

menu_movie_gam053_04	If you put your face right up against the table, the air\x0d\ncoming out of it is really refreshing.

menu_movie_gam054.msbt
menu_movie_gam054_00	Ooh, pretty! Is this a "stuff is falling" game?
menu_movie_gam054_01	Yep! For this one, you want to try to connect\x0d\nsix balls of the same color to clear them.
menu_movie_gam054_02	And you lose if they pile up to the top? Seems pretty\x0d\nstraightforward.
menu_movie_gam054_03	Ready... GO!
menu_movie_gam054_03_2	Ready... GO!
menu_movie_gam054_04	Behold my secret technique!

menu_movie_gam055_ttm_10	There's nowhere to run! Aaaaah!
menu_movie_gam055_ttm_11	Sorry, sir. They kicked our butts.
menu_movie_gam055_ttm_12	Those tanks had families...
menu_movie_gam055_ttm_13	Sir, we need a new plan, ASAP!
menu_movie_gam055_ttm_14	All right. All right.
menu_movie_gam055_ttm_15	First, we'll go at the enemy boss with everything.
menu_movie_gam055_ttm_16	Then we'll split up to pick off whoever's left.
menu_movie_gam055_ttm_17	Sir! That's the exact strategy that just failed, sir!
menu_movie_gam055_ttm_18	Ugh! Well...uh...
menu_movie_gam055_ttm_19	What if we took them one at a time?

menu_movie_gam056_05	You're aiming for the center of the target.
menu_movie_gam056_06	Right.
menu_movie_gam056_07	No, not right, center. You have to aim carefully.
menu_movie_gam056_08	Oh, like this?
menu_movie_gam056_09	Good news! The darts work fine!
menu_movie_gam056_10	Credit to my mentorship, of course.

menu_movie_gam102_01	Heh heh, sure.

menu_movie_gam102_03	Two against one, huh? Still unfair for you.
menu_movie_gam102_04	Don't be so sure!
menu_movie_gam102_05	Aww, no match.
menu_movie_gam102_06	Oooh, it's my turn.
menu_movie_gam102_07	Ah well. The first turn's just for poking around,\x0d\nanyway.
menu_movie_gam102_08	We're up next!
menu_movie_gam102_09	You poor children. Heh heh...
menu_movie_gam102_10	I'm not stopping there!
menu_movie_gam102_11	I'm too scared to remember cards!

menu_movie_gam103_03	I win!

menu_movie_gam104_04	How do we do that?
menu_movie_gam104_05	Easy. 
menu_movie_gam104_06	First, you draw a card from the deck.
menu_movie_gam104_07	Oh, it's a game!
menu_movie_gam104_07_2	Oh, it's a game!
menu_movie_gam104_08	If your card is between an ace and a 10...
menu_movie_gam104_09	You flip over the card in that position.
menu_movie_gam104_10	Ten slots! Like a takoyaki pan!
menu_movie_gam104_11	If the card you flip is a position you haven't flipped yet,\x0d\nthen you're in luck! You get to flip again.
menu_movie_gam104_12	Anytime you flip a face card, your turn ends.
menu_movie_gam104_13	So...I have to be the first to cook all 10 takoyaki?
menu_movie_gam104_14	You got it! And speaking of which, here's your food.\x0d\nThat'll be 10 million bucks!

menu_movie_gam105_00	This style of poker is half about the cards you have\x0d\nand half about what's on the table.
menu_movie_gam105_01	So everyone knows something, but no one knows\x0d\neverything.
menu_movie_gam105_02	Exactly. Trying to read the other players is what\x0d\nmakes it such an exciting game.
menu_movie_gam105_03	Now I've gotta try it!
menu_movie_gam105_04	Hmm. A pair's better than nothing, I guess.

menu_movie_gam105_15	Then why's it called a "flush"?
menu_movie_gam105_16	Because now my victory's in the toilet.
menu_movie_gam105_33	Pair

menu_movie_gam106_05	Notice anything about the way the cards are laid out?
menu_movie_gam106_06	No.
menu_movie_gam106_07	I give up. We start by taking a card and putting it in\x0d\nthe middle.
menu_movie_gam106_08	Like this?
menu_movie_gam106_09	Then you pick another card and hope it's not the\x0d\nsame suit.
menu_movie_gam106_10	What if it IS the same suit?
menu_movie_gam106_11	You have to eat the whole pile!

menu_movie_gam109_08	Blackjack! The house wins.
menu_movie_gam109_09	You've gotta be kidding me!
menu_movie_gam109_10	Your gut can't argue with numbers.
menu_movie_gam109_15	2 + 4 = 6
menu_movie_gam109_16	6 + J(10) = 16
menu_movie_gam109_17	16 + 4 = 20
menu_movie_gam109_18	K(10) + A(11) = 21
menu_movie_gam109_19	Hit
menu_movie_gam109_20	Stand
menu_movie_gam110.msbt
menu_movie_gam110_00	Who's up for Sevens?
menu_movie_gam110_01	Me! Me!
menu_movie_gam110_01_2	Me! Me!
menu_movie_gam110_02	Ehhhh, I dunno...
menu_movie_gam110_03	Come on, please!
menu_movie_gam110_03_2	Come on, please!
menu_movie_gam110_03_3	Come on, please!
menu_movie_gam110_04	Here's your cards!
menu_movie_gam110_05	I'll go first. You've gotta put out a 6 or an 8 to go\x0d\nwith the 7.
menu_movie_gam110_06	I can't play anything. Pass.
menu_movie_gam110_07	Me three!
menu_movie_gam110_08	I pass too.
menu_movie_gam110_09	Hmmm. I think...that I...\x0e\x01\x06\x02\x01\xcdwill pass.
menu_movie_gam110_10	Aw, I can't pass anymore. That's it for me!
menu_movie_gam110_11	Is someone holding back the 6 of spades?
menu_movie_gam110_20	Dang it...
menu_movie_gam110_12	Ha! I win!
menu_movie_gam110_13	Of course it was you!\x0e\x01\x06\x02\x01\xcd
menu_movie_gam110_13_2	Of course it was you!
menu_movie_gam110_13_3	Of course it was you!

menu_movie_gam112_00	Klondike is the best-known version of solitaire.
menu_movie_gam112_01	Keep moving cards around so they form stacks in\x0d\norder from high to low.
menu_movie_gam112_02	But you can't put a card on top of the same color.\x0d\nRed has to go on black, and vice versa.
menu_movie_gam112_03	Just like real life, you win when everything is put\x0d\naway where it belongs.
menu_movie_gam112_04	Hear that, kids?
menu_movie_gam112_05	Stack cards of the same suit in order of A→2…K.
menu_movie_gam113.msbt
menu_movie_gam113_00	There are lots of types of solitaire.
menu_movie_gam113_01	In this one, you need to stack up full sets of cards\x0d\nfrom king through ace.
menu_movie_gam113_02	If you run out of moves, you draw more cards from\x0d\nthe deck.
menu_movie_gam113_03	*sigh* 
menu_movie_gam113_04	The best part of solitaire is that no one is watching you\x0d\nwhen you lose.
menu_movie_gam113_05	Oh no! YOU'RE watching!

pl_first_mess_03	All right, I'll catch you later!
pl_select_talk_00_00	The world is full of games that not\x0d\neverybody knows. But everybody should!
pl_select_talk_00_01	I picked out games you can play right\x0d\naway. They make a great starting point!
pl_select_talk_01_00	I like the kind of games you can just pick\x0d\nup and play using touch controls.
pl_select_talk_01_01	With these games, you can face off\x0d\nagainst someone in seconds!
pl_select_talk_02_00	These games come up a lot in social\x0d\nsettings, so it's good to know how to play.
pl_select_talk_02_01	The games I like are tricky to learn, but\x0d\nyou'll look cool for knowing them!
pl_select_talk_02_02	If billiards seems too complicated for you,\x0d\nI suggest playing it with Simple rules.
pl_select_talk_03_00	Long, long ago, these were what people\x0d\nplayed before video games existed.
pl_select_talk_03_01	Nintendo actually manufactured these\x0d\ngames in Japan.
pl_select_talk_03_02	I picked president as a card game to\x0d\nintroduce here.
pl_select_talk_04_00	I could play these simple, breezy card\x0d\ngames over and over again.
pl_select_talk_04_01	I've got a collection of classic card games\x0d\nthat you can play with anyone. They're\x0d\nguaranteed to be a good time!
pl_select_talk_05_00	It's game day, and I've got just the intense\x0d\nsports action you need!
pl_select_talk_05_01	Using corner kicks is the key to getting\x0d\nahead in Toy Soccer.
pl_select_talk_06_00	How about a few games that'll make you\x0d\nlose track of the time?
pl_select_talk_06_01	Take a break and immerse yourself in\x0d\nthese games.
pl_select_talk_07_00	These games have a lot of history. Play\x0d\nthem and you become a part of it!
pl_select_talk_07_01	Did you know backgammon was apparently\x0d\nbased on a game that existed before\x0d\nrecorded history?
pl_select_talk_08_00	I tried to pick games that are especially\x0d\ngood to take with you and play wherever.
pl_select_talk_08_01	I like to fish, but I also like to go hiking.\x0d\nThis way, I can do both!
pl_select_talk_08_02	And when my friends and I are ready to\x0d\ntake a break, we can enjoy a few games\x0d\nover a nice picnic lunch.
pl_select_talk_09_00	Let me tell you about the four great\x0d\ngames of the world!
pl_select_talk_09_01	The four most widely played games in the\x0d\nworld are apparently dominoes, chess,\x0d\nbackgammon, and card games.
pl_select_talk_09_02	Blackjack here is kind of standing in for\x0d\nall card games as a whole. You should go\x0d\ntalk to Olivia for some others.
pl_select_talk_10_00	Personally, I play these every morning to\x0d\nsee what kind of day it'll be.
pl_select_talk_10_01	On days where I win, I can tell there are\x0d\nbig things in store for me!
pl_select_talk_11_00	If everybody brings their systems, then\x0d\ntrying to read your opponents is fun on\x0d\na whole new level.
pl_select_talk_11_01	I love taking a guess at what cards the\x0d\nother players might have!
pl_select_talk_12_00	The games in my collection are pretty\x0d\ndeep. That's what makes them feel so\x0d\ngood to master!
pl_select_talk_12_01	Don't worry if you're not good at them\x0d\nright away! Just focus on the parts that\x0d\nare fun for you. 
pl_select_talk_12_02	True understanding can come later\x0d\nat your own pace.
pl_select_talk_13_00	How about a few action games that get\x0d\nright into it?
pl_select_talk_13_01	Sometimes you don't wanna think too\x0d\nhard, right? Let's put our reflexes to\x0d\nthe test instead!
pl_select_talk_14_00	I travel a lot, so it's nice to have games I\x0d\ncan have fun playing with someone else\x0d\non a long flight.
pl_select_talk_14_01	The pieces don't fall over even when\x0d\nthere's some turbulence, which is nice.
pl_select_talk_15_00	What I like about these games is that you\x0d\ncan really develop a technique.
pl_select_talk_15_01	It's fun to keep trying and seeing yourself\x0d\nget better over time.
pl_select_talk_15_02	Did you know that there's a Challenge\x0d\nmode in bowling?
pl_select_talk_16_00	You can play these with three or four\x0d\npeople around a single console.
pl_select_talk_16_01	They're also fun on a TV. Either way,\x0d\nevery player will need their own Joy-Con\x0d\ncontroller.
pl_select_talk_17_00	These are my favorite games for when I\x0d\nwant to get serious.
pl_select_talk_17_01	When I lose, I just try to remember what I\x0d\ndid wrong so I can correct it next time.
