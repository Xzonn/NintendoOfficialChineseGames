23519065    {tp:0.01}Anyhoo, it's been too long, my boy!{p}What have you been up to?{p}{p}I imagine you've been off{p}adventuring with that daredevil{p}brother of yours.{/tp}
23519066    {tp:0.01}Me? Oh, I've just been continuing my{p}research on paranormal happenings{p}and whatnot.{/tp}
23519067    {tp:0.01}In fact, after our last adventure{p}I became somewhat of an{p}authority in the field!{/tp}
23519068    {tp:0.01}But enough about that. Let me fill{p}you in on our ghostly predicament!{/tp}
23519069    {tp:0.01}See that on the screen?{p}That there is the {clr:A554D0}Dark Moon{clr:pop}.{p}{p}It's a mysterious celestial body{p}that has a pacifying effect on all of{p}the ghosts in {clr:FF9754}Evershade Valley{clr:pop}.{/tp}
2351906A    {tp:0.01}When I heard about it, I jumped at{p}the rare chance to study ghosts in{p}a peaceful environment.{/tp}
2351906B    {tp:0.01}It was incredible, my boy! I was{p}doing some of the best research of{p}my long and storied career!{p}That is, until something snapped{p}inside the ghosts and they{p}suddenly got all hostile!{/tp}
23519083    {tp:0.01}It got so bad, I had to escape from{p}the {clr:FF9754}Gloomy Manor{clr:pop} and hide here,{p}where the ghosts can't find me.{/tp}
23519084    {tp:0.01}Of course, I'm not one to sit around{p}and twiddle my thumbs. I wanted to{p}know why the ghosts freaked out.{/tp}
23519085    {tp:0.01}So I settled in and did some{p}research to figure out what{p}had happened.{/tp}
23519086    {tp:0.01}That's when I discovered something{p}truly astonishing: the {clr:A554D0}Dark Moon{p}{clr:pop}had vanished from the sky!{/tp}
23519087    {tp:0.01}And on top of that, the whole of{p}{clr:FF9754}Evershade Valley{clr:pop} had become{p}enveloped in an eerie fog.{/tp}
23519088    {tp:0.01}Now, I can't be sure, but I think the{p}disappearance of the {clr:A554D0}Dark Moon{clr:pop}{p}is what caused all this mess.{/tp}
23519089    {tp:0.01}And what a mess it is!{p}{p}{p}If we don't do something about it,{p}the ghosts might leave this valley{p}and terrorize the world beyond!{/tp}
2351908A    {tp:0.01}Worse still, my research will go to{p}waste! We can't let that happen,{p}my boy!{/tp}
2351908B    {tp:0.01}Now, I've got good news and I've got{p}bad news. Wait here.{/tp}
2351908C    {tp:0.01}The good news is that I found a{p}fragment of the {clr:A554D0}Dark Moon{clr:pop} nearby!{p}{p}But the bad news is that I found a{p}fragment of the {clr:A554D0}Dark Moon {clr:pop}nearby, {p}meaning the thing's broken.{p}And this {clr:A554D0}Dark Moon {clr:pop}piece seems to{p}be corrupted by some sort of {p}energy...{/tp}
235190A4    {tp:0.01}I reckon it's a disruptive energy{p}that suppresses the {clr:A554D0}Dark M{clr:pop}{clr:A554D0}oon{clr:pop}'s{p}ability to pacify ghosts!{/tp}
235190A5    {tp:0.01}But lucky for us, I've got inventions{p}for all kinds of situations!{p}{p}Stand back, sonny!{/tp}
235190A6    {tp:0.01}Heh heh! I've done it, {clr:51E949}Luigi{clr:pop}!{p}It seems to have regained its{p}original power!{/tp}

235190AB    {tp:0.01}But more importantly, it means that{p}restoring the {clr:A554D0}Dark Moon {clr:pop}will solve{p}all our problems!{/tp}
235190AC    {tp:0.01}If we find all the {clr:A554D0}Dark Moon {clr:pop}pieces,{p}the fog in the valley will vanish and{p}the ghosts will return to normal.{/tp}
