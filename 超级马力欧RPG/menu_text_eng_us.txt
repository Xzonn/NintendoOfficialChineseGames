Switch
When you have four or more party members, press \v to switch an active ally with\none who's on standby. Mario must always be in the active party. You can't switch\nparty members out again until the next turn.
While you have fewer than three party members and the gauge is at 100%, you\ncan press \u to get a Toad Assist. If you want a certain effect, try to time your\njump well to get it. You cannot use this while Mario is out of action.
While you have three active party members and the gauge is at 100%, you can\npress \u for a Triple Move. These do different things depending on who's in your\nactive party. If you have three active party members and someone other than\nMario is down, you'll use Toad Assist instead of a Triple Move.
Mario+Mallow+Geno: Star Riders\nHarness the power of the Star Pieces to deal a ton of nonelemental damage to a\nsingle enemy.
Mario+Mallow+Bowser: Clown Car Barrage\nDamage all enemies. With three elements—fire, ice, and lightning—it's easy to\nhit a weakness.
Mario+Geno+Bowser: Shooting Star Shot\nDamage enemies with powerful shooting stars. Boosts the party's Speed, Attack,\nand Mg. Attack for three turns.
Mario+Mallow+Peach: Healing Rainbow\nFully restore the whole party's HP—including downed allies—with glistening\nrainbow power. Also heals status effects.
Mario+Geno+Peach: Spare-Us-All\nSpread a starry umbrella over the whole active party to protect them from a\nsingle attack.
Mario+Bowser+Peach: Starry Shell Spike\nHit all enemies hard with a star-powered shell for nonelemental damage.
When you attack with \o,\npressing \o again with the\nright timing will trigger an\nAction Command and deal\nextra damage. Especially\ngood timing will cause a\nshock wave to damage any\nsurrounding enemies.
If you time it right, you can\nalso press \o when an\nenemy attacks for an\nAction Command that\nreduces the damage you\ntake. If your timing is\nperfect, you'll take no\ndamage at all.
Chain Count
After a few successful Action\nCommands in a row, you'll start\na Chain. When a Chain is going,\nyour Ally Buffs will kick in.
This gauge fills as you do Action\nCommands. (Failing them doesn't\nlower it.) When it's full, you can\nuse a Triple Move or Toad Assist.
A failed Action Command will break the Chain, resetting it to 0. When allies or\nenemies miss, or when enemies target the whole party, the Chain is not broken.\nThe Chain count stays where it is after a battle ends. Whenever the Chain hits a\nmultiple of 10, you get an extra buff that boosts the Action Gauge.
Each member of your active party gives a different kind of Ally Buff. The level of\nthe buff changes based on the Chain count. At 2 there's a small stat boost,\nat 3-4 there's a regular stat boost, and at 5+ there's a big stat boost. There are\nno buffs until the Chain reaches 2.
The Action Gauge fills up faster.
Increases Mg. Attack.
Increases Attack and Speed.
Increases Defense.
Increases Mg. Defense.
When using new weapons\nor fighting new enemies, a\n! mark will be shown to help\nyou get Action Command\ntiming right. This mark will\ngo away once you start\ngetting the timing down.
Special moves may require\nAction Commands other\nthan timed \o presses,\nsuch as mashing \o or\nrotating \y.
Enemy attacks may inflict a status effect. You can use items or Special moves to\nrecover. If you don't, you will recover after three turns or when battle ends.\nYou can only suffer one status effect at a time.
Mute
Prevents you from using Special moves with \r.
Sleep
Prevents you from acting until you wake up. Getting hit by\nan enemy's attack will wake you up.
Poison
Decreases your HP a little bit every turn.
Fear
Decreases your Attack, Mg. Attack, Defense, and\nMg. Defense while you are shaking with fear.
Mushroom
Disables your ability to act while you are a mushroom.\nHowever, you'll regain HP little by little.
Scarecrow
Prevents you from attacking with \o or using items with \q.\nYou can still use Special moves with \r.
Downed
When your HP falls to 0, you will be totally unable to act. This\nis the only status that won't end on its own after a few turns.
Some Special moves and\nitems have an element.\nYou can deal lots of\ndamage by attacking an\nenemy with the right\nelement. When you do,\n"Weakness" will display.
When a status effect has no\neffect, "Resistance" will\ndisplay. You'll also see this\nwhen an elemental attack\nhas no effect.
You can use Mallow's\nSpecial move, Thought\nPeek, to learn what\nelements and status\neffects are effective\nagainst an enemy.
When enemies have low HP, their names turn red, and the note "Almost Down" is\ndisplayed beneath them.
You'll sometimes encounter stronger-than-normal enemies. Beating them earns\nextra experience and coins. They even drop Frog Coins! These enemies will have\nnames shown in orange, with "Special Enemy" displayed beneath them.
You might get a Bonus Flower after defeating an enemy. These have one of five\ndifferent effects. Which Bonus Flower you get depends on the enemy you defeat.\nThe Bonus Flower goes to the ally who defeated the enemy.
HP MAX
Restores your HP.
ATTACK UP
Raises the Attack stat for the current battle.
DEFENSE UP
Raises the Defense stat for the current battle.
ONCE AGAIN
Allows the ally to take one more action on their turn.
LUCKY
Gives you a shot at Yoshi's guessing game after the\nbattle ends.
When you win a battle, you receive experience and coins. You may also receive\nitems, including rare ones sometimes. You lose if all allies fall to 0 HP and will\nrestart from your last save.
Yoshi's guessing game is a minigame that gives you a chance to double the coins\nor experience you got from the battle. If you fail, you'll get no coins or experience.\nWhether you play for coins or for experience is decided automatically. After the\neggs are shuffled, if you pick the egg with Yoshi inside, you win.
You can raise stats and learn new Special moves by gaining experience and\nleveling up. As a level-up bonus, you can boost certain stats by choosing between\nHP, Physical (Attack and Defense), and Magic (Mg. Attack and Mg. Defense).\nHow much of a bonus you get changes based on the level and character.
