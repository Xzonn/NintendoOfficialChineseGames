CAPTION_PROLOGUE_PAGE_01	Metroid:||A virulent floating organism that drained energy from its prey through physical contact. Metroids were originally created by the Chozo and named after their word for "ultimate warrior." Their value as a bioweapon sparked several crises, and as a result, all traces of them have been eliminated. They are now extinct.
CAPTION_PROLOGUE_PAGE_02	X Parasite:||A gelatinous, parasitic organism indigenous to the planet SR388. It could absorb the DNA of its host, living or dead, and replicate its form. When infecting a living host, it could even access the host's memories. X parasites were driven not by emotion but by an instinctive need to replicate and spread to increasingly stronger hosts. Their inability to be controlled marked them as even more dangerous than their sole predator, the Metroids. Like the Metroids, they are believed extinct.
CAPTION_PROLOGUE_PAGE_03	With no Metroids surviving on SR388, it became infested with the X, horrifying parasites capable of imitating any living being. Unaware of this, I set foot on the planet, got infected, and almost died.
CAPTION_PROLOGUE_PAGE_04	The only thing that saved me was a vaccine created from Metroid DNA, which also left me uniquely able to oppose the X. This ability was tested immediately when I went to a Biologic Space Laboratories (B.S.L.) research station to investigate a distress signal.
CAPTION_PROLOGUE_PAGE_05	There, I battled many powerful X forms, including the SA-X, which was the X mimicking me in my Power Suit at full strength. I eventually eliminated the X menace on SR388 by setting the B.S.L. research station on a collision course with the planet.
CAPTION_PROLOGUE_PAGE_06	After that, the X and Metroids were just memories. Or so we thought. Just when it all seemed over, the Galactic Federation received a mysterious video transmission.
CAPTION_PROLOGUE_PAGE_07	It showed an X. Alive and in the wild.
CAPTION_PROLOGUE_PAGE_08	Thorough analysis proved the video was real. Although the sender was unknown, the transmission was traced to a particular planet.
CAPTION_PROLOGUE_PAGE_09	It was called ZDR. If the X had somehow escaped extinction out there, they would pose a threat to the entire galaxy. The Galactic Federation dispatched a research team of seven E.M.M.I. to investigate.
CAPTION_PROLOGUE_PAGE_10	An E.M.M.I. is a large research robot designed to capture field samples and extract their DNA. Their incredible mobility and protective plating, made of the strongest stuff in the universe, practically guaranteed the mission's success.
CAPTION_PROLOGUE_PAGE_11	But not long after their arrival on ZDR, all communication was lost.
CAPTION_PROLOGUE_PAGE_12	What is happening on ZDR? Is the planet really infested with X? As the only one immune to the parasites, it's up to me to go there and find out.
CAPTION_INTRO_PAGE_1	We'll soon be entering ZDR's atmosphere.
CAPTION_INTRO_PAGE_2	
DISPLAY_ADAM_INTRO_PAGE_1	The bounty for this mission does not seem appropriate.
CAPTION_INTRO_PAGE_3	
DISPLAY_ADAM_INTRO_PAGE_2	The risk clearly outweighs|the reward.

CAPTION_INTRO_LANDING_PAGE_01	Signal quality is likely to be low. Remote communication may pose a problem.
CAPTION_INTRO_LANDING_PAGE_02	Try to connect to the facility's network when you reach the bottom. That way we can remain in contact.
CAPTION_INTRO_LANDING_PAGE_03	Any objections, Lady?
CAPTION_DATAUPLOAD_01	Uploading data...
DIAG_ADAM_CAVE_1_PAGE_1	So, you've accessed a network station. Well done, Samus. I have reviewed your {c1}vital signs and video log{c0} from the data you uploaded.
DIAG_ADAM_CAVE_1_PAGE_2	I've run a full analysis. But I cannot account for why you lost consciousness. My readings indicate dramatic physical changes in you.
DIAG_ADAM_CAVE_1_PAGE_3	Whatever caused these changes seems to have stripped you of most abilities. You might call it physical amnesia.
DIAG_ADAM_CAVE_1_PAGE_4	That brings me to your assailant. I am checking the Federation database against your video log. It appears to have been a {c1}Chozo{c0}. The attacker's identity is not yet clear.
DIAG_ADAM_CAVE_1_PAGE_5	I have determined that you are somewhere within {c1}the depths of ZDR{c0}. Your top priority should be to return to your ship on the surface. This situation is...precarious. Trust your instincts as you {c1}navigate upward{c0}.
DIAG_ADAM_CAVE_1_PAGE_5_B	This planet appears to consist of multiple areas. Shuttles, elevators, and other modes of transport connect them. Keep an eye out for {c1}ways to reach the surface{c0}.
DIAG_ADAM_CAVE_1_PAGE_6	The ship's location is marked on your {c1}global map{c0}. Check it for yourself.
DIAG_ADAM_CAVE_1_PAGE_6_B	You may encounter pockets of low temperature. Your Metroid DNA renders you vulnerable to such environments. {c1}Spending time in cold areas will be harmful to you.{c0}
DIAG_ADAM_CAVE_1_PAGE_6_C	There are many such cold areas scattered underground. Do not enter them {c1}with your basic Power Suit{c0}.
DIAG_ADAM_CAVE_1_PAGE_7	One final thing. Underground interference is {c1}preventing radio{c0} {c1}transmissions{c0}. Check in with me at any network stations you find.
DIAG_ADAM_CAVE_2_PAGE_1	Both E.M.M.I. you encountered were clearly trying to capture you.|They may have been hacked. If so, it's reasonable to assume {c1}all E.M.M.I.{c0}|{c1}will be hostile{c0}.
DIAG_ADAM_CAVE_2_PAGE_2	E.M.M.I. send out a {c1}pulse{c0} to detect vibrations in the air within a certain range. Essentially, {c1}they can hear you{c0}.
DIAG_ADAM_CAVE_2_PAGE_2_B	Upon detecting vibrations, an E.M.M.I. {c1}enters surveillance mode to track their source{c0}. Stay out of its {c1}line of sight{c0} when this happens. Otherwise, the danger to you increases dramatically.
DIAG_ADAM_CAVE_2_PAGE_3	An E.M.M.I. that has seen you will {c1}begin pursuit{c0}. Part of the pursuit protocol is to {c1}seal the E.M.M.I. Zone exits{c0}. You will be trapped inside.
DIAG_ADAM_CAVE_2_PAGE_3_B	To survive, you must leave its range of pursuit. Evade the E.M.M.I. and it will disengage. This will also unseal the exits.
DIAG_ADAM_CAVE_2_PAGE_3_C	An E.M.M.I. never leaves its assigned Zone. Their control system must permit them to operate only within that range...
DIAG_ADAM_CAVE_2_PAGE_4	I estimate a {c1}99% probability of death{c0} if an E.M.M.I. captures you.
DIAG_ADAM_CAVE_2_PAGE_5	There may be a very small opportunity to escape. But exploiting this window will be {c1}virtually impossible{c0}. 
DIAG_ADAM_CAVE_2_PAGE_5_B	The E.M.M.I. are immune to your current weapons. You lack the {c1}unique energy{c0} used to defeat the first E.M.M.I. Your only option now is to evade capture and find an exit.
DIAG_ADAM_CAVE_2_PAGE_6	Your highest priority in an E.M.M.I. Zone should be simply to survive.
DIAG_ADAM_CAVE_3_PAGE_1	There was no record of your assailant in the Federation database. However, there are records of a {c1}Chozo warrior{c0} tribe. There is a strong possibility the two are connected.
DIAG_ADAM_CAVE_3_PAGE_2	You have seen the warrior tribe's architecture and artifacts on this planet.|I conclude that this was one of their settlements. But why would someone lead you here and send the E.M.M.I. after you? The footage of the X parasite may have been staged to lure you in...
DIAG_ADAM_CAVE_3_PAGE_3	The situation remains unclear. But your priority hasn't changed. You must return to the ship.
DIAG_ADAM_CAVE_3_PAGE_4	You have activated the magma supply system. That has restored power to the closed thermal doors. {c1}Seek them out to proceed{c0}.
DIAG_ADAM_CAVE_3_PAGE_5	Continue to search for the {c1}unique energy{c0} you employed against the first E.M.M.I. It is the only way you can confront them.
DIAG_ADAM_CAVE_3_PAGE_6	Unfortunately, this energy is limited. You may have noticed it dissipating after an E.M.M.I. is destroyed.
DIAG_ADAM_CAVE_3_PAGE_7	There are {c1}six remaining E.M.M.I.{c0} hunting you. You have no means to confront them. Remember that.
DIAG_ADAM_MAGMA_1_PAGE_1	ZDR appears to be powered by thermal energy. Magma is pumped from the planet's interior and routed from there.
DIAG_ADAM_MAGMA_1_PAGE_2	I have located the central routing system for the magma. It is here|in {c1}Cataris{c0}.
DIAG_ADAM_MAGMA_1_PAGE_3	Samus, your current suit cannot protect you as you explore {c1}Cataris{c0}.|The {c1}extreme heat of the lava{c0} is too much for it. Under no circumstances should you enter high-temperature areas.
DIAG_ADAM_MAGMA_1_PAGE_4	I note a {c1}shuttle{c0} somewhere above here. Use it to find a path forward.
DIAG_ADAM_MAGMA_1_PAGE_5	There is one other thing to discuss. It is your new {c1}Phantom Cloak{c0} ability.
DIAG_ADAM_MAGMA_1_PAGE_5_B	The Phantom Cloak {c1}prevents the E.M.M.I. from detecting you.{c0} Thus far, your only option was to run. Now bypassing them is also an option. Use this to reach your objective.
DIAG_ADAM_MAGMA_1_PAGE_6	Note that using the Phantom Cloak {c1}severely decreases your mobility{c0}.|And {c1}direct contact with an E.M.M.I. will still result in capture{c0}. It is up to|you whether to hold your position. Just {c1}be aware of your surroundings{c0}.
DIAG_ADAM_MAGMA_1_PAGE_6_B	The {c1}Phantom Cloak is useless once an E.M.M.I. sees you{c0}. You will need to evade capture until it gives up pursuit.
DIAG_ADAM_MAGMA_1_PAGE_7	The Phantom Cloak can remain active after your Aeion has been depleted. It will {c1}consume your life energy{c0} instead. Consider it a desperate measure. Remember, it {c1}cannot drain your energy down to nothing{c0}. Judicious use of this technique will improve your probability of survival.
DIAG_ADAM_MAGMA_2_PAGE_1	E.M.M.I. stands for Extraplanetary Multiform Mobile Identifier. It can procedurally modify and enhance its own capabilities.
DIAG_ADAM_MAGMA_2_PAGE_2	Its ability to configure itself to fit into narrow spaces is a standard feature. Any E.M.M.I. you encounter will likely do so as it pursues you.
DIAG_ADAM_MAGMA_2_PAGE_3	You are not capable of destroying their armor plating. {c1}This would be true even at your full capabilities{c0}.
DIAG_ADAM_MAGMA_2_PAGE_4	You are faced with overwhelming power. Accept your helplessness.
DIAG_ADAM_MAGMA_2_PAGE_6	Study each E.M.M.I. carefully, and use the Phantom Cloak to advance. There are risks even here. The Phantom Cloak reduces your mobility and {c1}consumes more Aeion when you move or shoot{c0}. It is still your best chance at survival.
DIAG_ADAM_MAGMA_2_PAGE_8	Do not hesitate to destroy an E.M.M.I. whenever you discover more|unique energy. This was not one of your original priorities. However, I see no other way to accomplish your goal. These existential threats cannot|be sanctioned.
DIAG_ADAM_LAB_1_PAGE_1	This area, {c1}Dairon{c0}, appears to be a biological-research laboratory. You have already reactivated one generator in this area. There is another sector above you still suffering from the blackout. Find the next generator and reactivate it.
DIAG_ADAM_LAB_1_PAGE_2	You are slowly recovering your abilities. I have still not established what happened to you physically. Don't let your guard down. Your primary objective is to survive. Proceed with the utmost care.
DIAG_ADAM_AQUA_1_PAGE_1	The lower levels of {c1}Burenia{c0} are mostly submerged. You will need your Gravity Suit to operate there at full efficiency.
DIAG_ADAM_AQUA_1_PAGE_2	Abilities such as the Grapple Beam or Space Jump will {c1}help you maneuver underwater{c0} to an extent. Find them as soon as possible.
CAPTION_PROFESSOREVENT_PAGE_01	I am Quiet Robe, a scientist of the Thoha tribe.
CAPTION_PROFESSOREVENT_PAGE_02	The Chozo who attacked you is called Raven Beak. 
CAPTION_PROFESSOREVENT_PAGE_03	He possesses superior physical prowess and intelligence, and is the leader of a Chozo warrior tribe called the Mawkin.
CAPTION_PROFESSOREVENT_PAGE_04	Aided by the Mawkin, a fellow tribe of the Chozo, we managed to contain the Metroids that were running rampant on SR388.
CAPTION_PROFESSOREVENT_PAGE_05	Our intention was to eradicate these Metroids, which had become more dangerous than ever before, by destroying the planet.
CAPTION_PROFESSOREVENT_PAGE_05_B	However...
CAPTION_PROFESSOREVENT_PAGE_06	Raven Beak...took extreme measures to prevent that.
CAPTION_PROFESSOREVENT_PAGE_07	He worships at the altar of power. In his eyes, the Metroids were...
CAPTION_PROFESSOREVENT_PAGE_08	symbolic of a power great enough to rule the galaxy.
CAPTION_PROFESSOREVENT_PAGE_09	Raven Beak plotted to bring the Metroids to ZDR and use them as a bioweapon.
CAPTION_PROFESSOREVENT_PAGE_10	To accomplish this, he needed the Thoha tribe, as we possess the ability to control the Metroids.
CAPTION_PROFESSOREVENT_PAGE_11	For that purpose, I alone was spared.
CAPTION_PROFESSOREVENT_PAGE_11_B	Raven Beak and the Mawkin tribe took me back to their homeworld, ZDR, in order to continue their preparations for gathering Metroids.
CAPTION_PROFESSOREVENT_PAGE_12	However, they ran into unforeseen difficulties and were forced to put their|plan on hold.
CAPTION_PROFESSOREVENT_PAGE_13	One of the soldiers who returned from SR388 was actually an X in disguise. 
CAPTION_PROFESSOREVENT_PAGE_14	ZDR descended into chaos. All of their soldiers were infected by the X.
CAPTION_PROFESSOREVENT_PAGE_15	Yet somehow, Raven Beak narrowly managed to contain them. 
CAPTION_PROFESSOREVENT_PAGE_16	He then turned his thoughts to resuming his plan...
CAPTION_PROFESSOREVENT_PAGE_17	But the Metroids on SR388 had already been eradicated by your hand.
CAPTION_PROFESSOREVENT_PAGE_18	With the Metroids now extinct...
CAPTION_PROFESSOREVENT_PAGE_19	Raven Beak's plans should have lain in ruin.
CAPTION_PROFESSOREVENT_PAGE_20	Yes, lain in ruin...if not for you.
CAPTION_PROFESSOREVENT_PAGE_21	The E.M.M.I. are being used by Raven Beak. Samus Aran...listen well. He has commanded them to...
CAPTION_PROFESSOREVENT_PAGE_22	extract the Metroid DNA from within your body.
CAPTION_PROFESSOREVENT_PAGE_23	Don't worry...
CAPTION_PROFESSOREVENT_PAGE_24	I'll end this. Once and for all.
CAPTION_PROFESSOREVENT_PAGE_25	You must proceed this way—I have unlocked the gate.
CAPTION_PROFESSOREVENT_PAGE_26	I am counting on you, Samus.
DIAG_ADAM_LAB_2_PAGE_1	Our Thoha friend has explained much. We now know why the E.M.M.I. are pursuing you. Samus Aran, {c1}Raven Beak{c0} lured you here. He wants the Metroid DNA that exists only within you.
DIAG_ADAM_LAB_2_PAGE_2	I have confirmed that Quiet Robe has {c1}deactivated all remaining E.M.M.I.{c0}|You should now be able to reach the surface unthreatened.
DIAG_ADAM_LAB_2_PAGE_3	{c1}The route Quiet Robe opened is in Burenia{c0}. Return there immediately.
DIAG_ADAM_FOREST_1_PAGE_1	Samus, you are approaching the surface. This area, {c1}Ghavoran{c0}, appears to be an underground forest.
DIAG_ADAM_FOREST_1_PAGE_2	The E.M.M.I. have been deactivated. But Raven Beak still desires the Metroid DNA within you. I have reviewed the video log of your encounter after your arrival.
DIAG_ADAM_FOREST_1_PAGE_3	You were no match for him then. You are no match for him now. It is true that you have recovered many of your combat abilities. However, my analysis suggests that you would not be a worthy adversary for him.|Not even at full power.
DIAG_ADAM_FOREST_1_PAGE_4	One thing still eludes me. Why did Raven Beak spare you during that encounter? Something must have motivated him.
CAPTION_QUARANTINE_PAGE_01	Scan complete.
CAPTION_PROFESSORX_PAGE_01	I am counting on you.
DIAG_ADAM_FOREST_2_PAGE_2	The X have been released from their confinement. They have now scattered across the planet. This is no doubt the work of Raven Beak.
DIAG_ADAM_FOREST_2_PAGE_3	His motives are still a mystery. But your Metroid DNA grants you immunity to the X parasites. You can even absorb them. Perhaps it was some kind|of message.
DIAG_ADAM_FOREST_2_PAGE_4	Regardless, the X are here. They are overrunning the planet. They must be destroyed. Hurry to your ship, Samus.
DIAG_ADAM_FOREST_2_PAGE_5	I trust you will make it here safely.
DIAG_ADAM_SANC_1_PAGE_1	This area, {c1}Ferenia{c0}, appears to have been a sanctuary. The Mawkin conducted ceremonies and rituals here. Now it all lies in ruin.
DIAG_ADAM_SANC_1_PAGE_2	It was likely destroyed in the chaos following the X's arrival. That would match what Quiet Robe said.
DIAG_ADAM_SANC_1_PAGE_3	They have turned it into a hive. I have also detected the presence of an unusually powerful X.
DIAG_ADAM_SANC_1_PAGE_4	Recall that the E.M.M.I. in this area could {c1}see through terrain{c0} and {c1}stun targets with an electric shot{c0}.
DIAG_ADAM_SANC_1_PAGE_4_B	My sensors indicate this E.M.M.I. has been reactivated. We can assume that Raven Beak is behind this too. Make good use of the Phantom Cloak and you should have nothing to fear.
DIAG_ADAM_SANC_1_PAGE_5	Be careful, Samus.
DIAG_ADAM_AQUA_2_PAGE_1	The X have spread across the entire planet. Assume all living organisms have by now been replaced by X.
DIAG_ADAM_AQUA_2_PAGE_2	There is another problem you may have noticed. {c1}The temperature of ZDR has started to fall{c0}.
DIAG_ADAM_AQUA_2_PAGE_3	I cannot say for certain if the X are to blame. But the drop in temperature is indisputable. The Gravity Suit should keep you {c1}insulated from the effect of low temperatures{c0}. Even so, beware the unexpected, and proceed with caution.
DIAG_ADAM_CAVE_4_PAGE_1	I have determined the reason for the planet's rapid cooling. Thermal energy is no longer being routed from {c1}Cataris{c0}.
DIAG_ADAM_CAVE_4_PAGE_2	This area, {c1}Artaria{c0}, is located in the depths of the planet. Much of it will be {c1}frozen{c0}. Find a way to thaw any frozen doors and pools you encounter.
DIAG_ADAM_CAVE_4_PAGE_3	The central control system you activated in {c1}Cataris{c0} is still operational. Some force must be physically blocking the routing of thermal energy.|I suspect a powerful X is involved. You must annihilate it.
DIAG_ADAM_CAVE_4_PAGE_4	Return here after solving the problem. The cooling has prevented you from exploring this area. There must be a {c1}vital ability{c0} hidden somewhere here.
DIAG_ADAM_AQUA_3_PAGE_1	Well done, Samus. You have stopped the planet from cooling. In addition, you have gained the Screw Attack ability. It will help you access previously unreachable places.
DIAG_ADAM_AQUA_3_PAGE_2	You are far more combat ready than when you first arrived. But you are still not prepared to face Raven Beak. There is a very low probability of success in standing against him now.
DIAG_ADAM_SHIP_1_PAGE_1	This area, {c1}Hanubia{c0}, is on the planet's surface. You've finally|made it, Samus.
DIAG_ADAM_SHIP_1_PAGE_2	There is still a problem. Destroying the planet will eliminate the X parasites. But Raven Beak is unlikely to sit idly by as this happens. He will try to escape once he detects the danger.
DIAG_ADAM_SHIP_1_PAGE_3	Raven Beak's search for Metroid DNA poses a threat to the galaxy.|He will never give up. The odds are still not in your favor. But you must|end things here.
DIAG_ADAM_SHIP_1_PAGE_4	I am searching for his location. {c1}Return here later for an update{c0}.
DIAG_ADAM_SHIP_2_PAGE_1	Samus, you have manifested a new power. The speed with which you siphon energy is undoubtedly Metroid in nature. 
DIAG_ADAM_SHIP_2_PAGE_2	The Metroid DNA inside you must have fully awakened. No doubt as a result of the many battles you have fought on this mission. 
DIAG_ADAM_SHIP_2_PAGE_3	This tremendous power is the last thing you required to confront|Raven Beak.
DIAG_ADAM_SHIP_2_PAGE_4	I have detected a {c1}fortress in the sky{c0} high above Hanubia. He must be there.
DIAG_ADAM_SHIP_2_PAGE_5	The time has come. Samus, fulfill your destiny.
DIAG_ADAM_FINAL_PAGE_01	It appears your Metroid DNA has {c1}caused you to become a Metroid{c0}. Ordinarily, this would have happened immediately after the DNA transplant.
DIAG_ADAM_FINAL_PAGE_02	Your {c1}Thoha genes{c0} must have {c1}slowed down the process{c0}. They were the only tribe capable of controlling the Metroids.
DIAG_ADAM_FINAL_PAGE_03	Though you possess their DNA, you are not a Thoha. Your physical prowess suggests that you must also possess {c1}Mawkin DNA{c0}.
DIAG_ADAM_FINAL_PAGE_04	Metroids are programmed to identify Mawkin as enemies. This suggests one thing to me.
DIAG_ADAM_FINAL_PAGE_05	It is very probable that your metamorphosis occurred as a result of Raven Beak's attack. His presence awakened the Metroid's killer instinct.
DIAG_ADAM_FINAL_PAGE_06	Since then, your metamorphosis has accelerated. It {c1}can no longer{c0}|{c1}be controlled{c0}.
DIAG_ADAM_FINAL_PAGE_07	You are now a Metroid, Samus Aran. Your very existence poses a grave threat to the galaxy.
DIAG_ADAM_FINAL_PAGE_08	However, there is no need to fear. You can still contribute to galactic peace. You need only use your new powers correctly.
DIAG_ADAM_FINAL_PAGE_09	You have followed my instructions faithfully so far. Continue to do so. It's that simple.
DIAG_ADAM_FINAL_PAGE_10	I consider your performance here on ZDR highly satisfactory. As I hoped, it has even awakened your Metroid powers.
DIAG_ADAM_FINAL_PAGE_11	I was right to let you live during our first encounter.|That one glimpse you showed told me everything.
DIAG_ADAM_FINAL_PAGE_12	Submit and offer up your power. My plan is the only way to bring order to the galaxy.
DIAG_ADAM_FINAL_PAGE_13	Fulfill your destiny, Samus. This is an order. Disobedience will not be tolerated.
DIAG_ADAM_FINAL_PAGE_14	You disappoint me...
DIAG_ADAM_FINAL_PAGE_15	my daughter.
CAPTION_HYPERMETROIDNIZATIONEVENT_PAGE_01	Did you truly believe you could defeat me? You overestimate yourself.
CAPTION_HYPERMETROIDNIZATIONEVENT_PAGE_02	You no longer serve any purpose. Even your Metroid DNA is no longer necessary.|Do you want to know why?
CAPTION_HYPERMETROIDNIZATIONEVENT_PAGE_03	It is because I can now clone an army of the most powerful Metroid of all...|Samus Aran.
CAPTION_HYPERMETROIDNIZATIONEVENT_PAGE_04	No one can stand in my way. Not even you.
CAPTION_HYPERMETROIDNIZATIONEVENT_PAGE_05	Foolish daughter... Leave the galaxy to me. Close your eyes and rest. 
CAPTION_HYPERMETROIDNIZATIONEVENT_PAGE_06	Power...is everything.
CAPTION_COMMANDERX_PAGE_01	Samuuuuus!
CAPTION_COMMANDERX_PAGE_02	Power is everything!
CAPTION_COMMANDERX_PAGE_03	There is no power without sacrifice.
CAPTION_ENDGAME_PAGE_1	Don't.
CAPTION_ENDGAME_PAGE_2	You'll drain the ship of its energy.
