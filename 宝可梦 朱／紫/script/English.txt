atlantis_talk_05_rival_03	Oh. Right...[VAR 0114(0004)]

atlantis_talk_06_rival_02	Then it lived here awhile with the professor?\nAlong with another one of its kind?[VAR 0114(0004)]
atlantis_talk_06_botan_01	That seems to be the story.[VAR 0114(0008)]
atlantis_talk_06_rival_03	So we...brought it back home, kind of! Or to its\nsecond home, at least![VAR 0114(0004)]
atlantis_talk_06_botan_02	I guess this place should be familiar to it, sure.[VAR 0114(0008)]

atlantis_talk_06_botan_03	... ... ...[VAR 0114(0008)]
atlantis_talk_06_botan_04	Given how [VAR 0101(0001)] was acting earlier...\nI think something bad happened to it here.[VAR 0114(0008)]
atlantis_talk_06_botan_05	Sometimes you get all shaky just seeing a place\nthat you’ve got bad memories of...[VAR 0114(0008)]
atlantis_talk_06_botan_06	It was the same for me when I was being ignored\nby everyone in my class.[VAR 0114(0008)]
atlantis_talk_06_botan_07	Just thinking about school made me want to hide\naway somewhere... So I know how it feels.[VAR 0114(0008)]
atlantis_talk_06_rival_06	Aw, Penny...[VAR 0114(0004)]
atlantis_talk_06_friend_04	So...maybe it got hurt down here in Area Zero,\njust like Mabosstiff?[VAR 0114(0006)]
atlantis_talk_06_botan_08	We can’t know for sure, but...it doesn’t change\ninto its battle form anymore, right?[VAR 0114(0008)]
atlantis_talk_06_botan_09	So I think it’s possible.[VAR 0114(0008)]
atlantis_talk_06_rival_07	But that’s so sad! We gotta do something to\nmake it feel better![VAR 0114(0004)]
atlantis_talk_06_rival_08	And no, I’m NOT just saying that ’cause I super\nbadly wanna battle [VAR 0101(0001)] myself![VAR 0114(0004)]

a_sch_entrance01_book_12_02	Certain status conditions will provide even better\nodds of a successful catch than others. Putting a\nPokémon to sleep or freezing it, for example,\nmay yield better results than inflicting poison,\nparalysis, or a burn.

a_sch_entrance01_book_14_02	For example, if a Pikachu—which is innately\nElectric type—has Steel as its Tera Type, then\nupon Terastallizing it would receive boosts in\npower for both the Steel-type move Iron Tail\nand the Electric-type move Thunderbolt.

a_sch_entrance01_ocalture_01_03a	In one arid corner of Paldea, there have been\nreports of a mysterious life-form. It’s said to\nresemble a Donphan at first glance, albeit one\nwith gigantic tusks, tough scales, and an\naggressive disposition.
a_sch_entrance01_ocalture_01_04a	Leading theories hold that this being is nothing\nless than a living relic of the dinosaur era, but\nno one can say for sure. Apparently, it’s called\nGreat Tusk after the name of a strange being that\nwas written about in the mysterious Scarlet Book.

a_sch_entrance01_ocalture_01_04b	Rumors say this being is some kind of weapon\nusing technology not of this world, but no one\ncan say for sure. Apparently, it’s called Iron\nTreads after the name of a strange being that was\nwritten about in the mysterious Violet Book.

a_sch_entrance01_ocalture_02_03a	Somewhere in a Paldean forest, it’s said, lurks\nScream Tail—a being with Jigglypuff’s own\nendearing puffball appearance but also a\nferocious aggression that leads it to attack\nanyone who comes near.
a_sch_entrance01_ocalture_02_04a	Its primitive appearance and savage nature have\nprompted rumors that it could be a Jigglypuff\nfrom one billion years ago. It’s named after a\ncreature in the Scarlet Book that is described as\nhaving a distinctive tail and scream.

a_sch_entrance01_ocalture_02_03b	The mysterious Violet Book makes reference to a\nbeing called Iron Bundle, which was said to look\nlike Delibird and to possess a spherical apparatus\nfrom which it would fire huge blasts of ice to\npropel itself through snowy lands.
a_sch_entrance01_ocalture_02_04b	Plenty of theories about it have been floated. A\nleading one suggests it is the product of a long-\ngone civilization—a notion supported by ancient\nwritings that describe the design and usage of\nmachines resembling Iron Bundle.

a_sch_entrance01_ocalture_03_04a	Slither Wing shares traits with Volcarona, so some\ntheorize that it may have been revived from\nfossils from a prehistoric era that we have\ndiscussed in these pages. However, no Volcarona\nfossils of that era are known to have been found.

a_sch_entrance01_ocalture_03_04b	Some point to Iron Moth’s aggression as a sign\nthat it is, in fact, a UFO of sorts being controlled\nby alien life. Perhaps something out there is using\nIron Moth to observe us, waiting for the moment\nto mount an invasion...

a_sch_entrance01_ocalture_04_04a	It’s said that Sandy Shocks is an aggressive sort\nand that some people who’ve seen it have been\nattacked as well. It takes its name from a beast\nwith a matching description in the era-defining\nScarlet Book.

a_sch_entrance01_ocalture_05_04a	Brute Bonnet certainly resembles Amoonguss,\nthough with its own unique twists: its gigantic\nstature and seemingly low intelligence combine\nto make it a savage, powerful fighter.
a_sch_entrance01_ocalture_05_02b	Enigmas of Paldea, File #06\nIron Thorns: A Tyranitar of the Distant Future?!
a_sch_entrance01_ocalture_05_03b	A strange being called Iron Thorns has been\nsighted in a certain cave in Paldea. This being\nbears a strong resemblance to Tyranitar, but it\napparently displays great coolheadedness and\nprefers to avoid unnecessary fights.
a_sch_entrance01_ocalture_05_04b	It appears to be highly intelligent and clad in\nmetallic armor, causing some to speculate that it\nmay be a Tyranitar as it would appear a billion\nyears from now. Its name comes from a similarly\ndescribed entity that appears in the Violet Book.

a_sch_entrance01_ocalture_06_03b	This being’s name comes from the one given to\nan iron-handed entity in the mysterious Violet\nBook. It is said to have fists that move\nindependent of its body and to be capable of\nthrowing large, fast-moving vehicles.
a_sch_entrance01_ocalture_06_04b	A leading theory holds that Iron Hands was once\nan athlete who became mortally wounded but\nwas kept alive by being made into a cyborg.\nWhy it so strongly resembles Hariyama, however,\nremains unanswered.

a_sch_entrance01_ocalture_07_03b	This oddity’s name is borrowed from that of an\nobject described in the Violet Book. One theory\nholds that it is in fact a robot—the product of a\nmad scientist’s efforts to create the most\npowerful psychic Pokémon of all.
a_sch_entrance01_ocalture_07_04b	According to its few eyewitnesses, Iron Valiant\nappears similar to both Gardevoir and Gallade.\nIt’s also said to be cruel enough to take its\nbrilliantly shining blade and cut down anyone\nconfronting it without hesitation.

a_w23_i11_02	Thanks to my prototype Tera Orb, I secured\ncorporate funding for my research and made\r\na laboratory in the lighthouse near Cabo Poco.\c\nSomeday, though, I’ll return to the crater and\nresume my study of these crystals.

c01_school_03	This is the famous, torturously long staircase of\nthe academy! Not an easy climb, is it?
c01_school_05	Mesagoza is like a full table—it’s got the school,\nit’s got culture, it’s got everything!
c01_school_09	There are lots of different people and Pokémon\nat the school—and you’re part of the variety!
c01_school_16	Those Team Star kids are a little scary, don’t\nyou think?
c01_school_17	I hear that Team Star races around every night,\nriding on weird cars of some kind.
c01_northwest_06	You get to choose which classes you want to take\nat the academy, right? Schools are so different\r\nfrom when I was a student...
c01_northwest_10	Hello? Yes, the students here are just the best.\nA huge help to everyone, really!
c01_northwest_16	They don’t call it the biggest city in Paldea for\nnothing! I’ve gotten myself completely lost!
c01_northwest_17	The green arrow in your map app points north!\nTo lock your map’s orientation so that north’s\r\nalways at the top, press the Right Stick!
c01_northwest_27	The Pokémon League’s through that tunnel, right?\c\nThat’s where you get tested to see if you can\nbecome a Champion!
c01_northwest_28	I just had my interview at the Pokémon League!\nThe interviewer was real scary, though...
c01_northwest_32	Outside the city, you’ll run into tons of Pokémon\nthat you’ve never seen before!
c01_northwest_40	You know Tulip the supermodel, right? Well,\napparently she’s a childhood friend of one of\r\nthe teachers at the academy!
c01_park_01	There are tons of hills and cliffs up ahead. Be\ncareful not to get lost, OK?\c\nOnce you get through, you’ll reach Artazon, the\ntown of nature and art!
c01_park_07	A famous professor unraveled the secrets of the\nTerastal phenomenon.
c01_park_08	I hear the professor’s doing some amazing\nresearch at the Great Crater of Paldea...
c01_park_10	Each night’s sleep brings you one day closer to\nschool! So make sure to get lots of sleep!
c01_park_11	I wanna go to the big school too!
c01_park_16	Time passes, weather changes...\c\nI hear wild Pokémon behave differently too,\ndepending on the weather and time of day.
c01_park_20	This pond is huge!\c\nI wanna float around in it just like a Magikarp!
c01_park_25	I feel like school teachers always get weird\nnicknames from their students.\c\nI keep hearing kids mentioning names like\n“Old Hass” and “Brovatore.”
c01_park_29	Some Pokémon can’t learn certain moves!
c01_park_38	I wanted to get a Tera Orb of my very own but\nmy grades weren’t quite good enough...
c01_park_39	You have to be a good student to get a Tera Orb.\nThey’re too powerful to be given out willy-nilly.
c01_center_south_01	This is Mesagoza, the biggest city in Paldea!
c01_center_south_15	Sagu’s home ec is a really useful class to take!
c01_center_south_16	Ms. Rai’s history classes are so much fun!
c01_center_south_31	Now, which sandwich shop should we eat\nat today?
c01_center_south_32	Shops in the same chain still have slightly\ndifferent menus depending on their location!
c01_center_south_44	The Pokémon you see around town are usually\nsomebody’s partner. It’s best you don’t try to\r\ncatch them!
c01_center_south_93	My Pokémon’s really sensitive to sounds!
c01_center_south_94	Pokémon of the same species can still have\ndifferent strengths, natures, and even Abilities.
c01_center_south_100	Rain in Paldea isn’t that cold and it stops really\nquickly, so nobody here uses an umbrella.
c01_center_north_33	My son told me he’d joined some group called\nTeam Star. I have no idea what kind of sports\r\nteam that is, but I’m sure it’s very fun!
c01_center_north_40	Look at this battle court right here in the\ncentral plaza!\c\nIt takes a lot of courage to battle here, since\nthere’s always going to be quite an audience!
c01_center_north_41	I heard that other regions only have one\nChampion!\c\nIt’s really cool that Paldea has so many\nChampion-ranked Trainers, don’t you think?
c01_center_north_54	I’m not a huge fan of shopping online... Nothing\nbeats being able to see the product firsthand.
c01_center_north_82	Did you know? You can have up to six Pokémon\non your team!
c01_center_north_83	Any Pokémon beyond the six on your team get\nsent to your Boxes, right?
c01_center_north_91	If I gather up the materials dropped by Pokémon\nand trade them in for LP, I can buy what I want...\r\neven if I don’t have any money!
c01_center_north_94	Mesagooozaaa, the city of leeeaaarning! ♪\nI studied at the school, my passion buuurning! ♪
c01_stairs_03	The entrance hall of the school is full of books,\nand you’re free to read as many as you’d like.\r\nIt’s a great place for any bookworm!
c01_stairs_08	I’m a graduate of the academy, you know!\nI wonder if they still do that Treasure Hunt thing.
c01_stairs_22	The academy doesn’t have any age restrictions—\neven my grandma could enroll! Maybe this is a\r\ngood chance to redo my own studies!
c01_square_01	The west gate is this way! Head out from there if\nyou want to go to Cortondo!
c01_square_02	The west gate is down the other path—the one\npast the canned goods store!
c01_square_03	This way’s a dead end! All you’ll find down there\nis the Go-for-Broke Grill!
c01_square_14	I better get ready for the Treasure Hunt.\nNow where was Delibird Presents...?
c01_square_15	There are a few Delibird Presents in this city.\nYou’ll run into one if you just head south.
c01_square_16	It’s such a relief when there’s a Pokémon Center\nnearby. I like the music they play, too.
c01_square_17	You can use a Flying Taxi to get back to any\nPokémon Center you’ve been to before!
c01_southeast_04	So what’s the difference between a town and a\ncity anyway? Is it the size...?
c01_southeast_05	There are three big cities here in Paldea! One of\nthem is where we are now—Mesagoza!
c01_southeast_08	I heard there were unusual sandwiches being sold\naround here, but...where?
c01_southeast_17	Sandwiches are so good! I wanna have one\nevery day!
c01_southeast_18	Hee hee! Do you want to try making sandwiches\ntogether sometime?
c01_southeast_27	The north side of the city is mostly residential.\c\nSeems they don’t let you live in the student dorm\nif you’re from Mesagoza. Makes sense, really.
c01_southeast_40	It makes me so happy just to see someone\nwalking around with their Pokémon.
c01_southeast_43	I love sandwiches! But this store’s sandwiches are\na particular favorite!
c01_southeast_45	If you get a smartphone case at Delibird Presents,\nyou can change how your Rotom Phone looks!\r\nSo many choices... Which one should I go for?
c01_southwest_06	Once I catch my own Pokémon, I’m gonna\nbecome a Champion-ranked Trainer!
c01_southwest_12	Are star-shaped shades popular at the school?\nI saw a group of students all wearing them.
c01_southwest_19	Each town’s battle court has a different color\nand look to it, you know?
c01_southwest_23	That nice lady at the Pokémon Center always\ngives me little tips when my Pokémon get healed.\r\nIs it just me? D’you think she likes me?!
c01_southwest_29	I’m having my Pachirisu hold an item I bought at\nDelibird Presents!\c\nPokémon can get all sorts of perks from the item\nthey hold, you know?
c01_southwest_31	Good things can happen from time to time if you\nlet your Pokémon hold a Quick Claw!\c\nThey have ’em for sale there at the red shop!
c01_southwest_36	You can reach Cortondo if you head out the west\ngate and just keep going. They have their harvest\r\nfestival around this time of year.
c01_southwest_53	Bronzong is so soothing...\c\nIt lets me get inside it from time to time. It’s the\nmost calming, peaceful experience...
c01_southwest_60	Well, I’m completely lost. Time to boot up the\nold map app.
c01_southwest_61	Some meals here will fill you with Egg Power!\c\nThat’ll make it easier for you to find Pokémon\nEggs when you’re out on a picnic!
c01_northeast_04	You can exchange materials dropped by\nPokémon for LP at the TM Machine!
c01_northeast_08	Machines these days are so talkative! Even the\nTM Machine’s real chatty, don’t you think?
c01_northeast_09	Pachirisu’s Ability is Run Away! It’s real good at\ngetting away from wild Pokémon!
c01_northeast_23	Huh. Vending machines these days let you buy a\ndrink with LP too, eh?
c01_northeast_24	The staircase in front of the school is famous for\nbeing torturously long. I certainly don’t envy the\r\nstudents who have to climb it regularly!
c01_northeast_37	If you come across a sleeping wild Pokémon,\nthat’s a great chance to get the drop on it!
c01_northeast_38	Whenever I see sleeping Pokémon, I can’t stop\nsnapping photos of them!
c01_northeast_47	What was the new director’s name...Mr. Clavell?\nHe became director about a year and a half ago.
c01_northeast_54	Do you know Nemona, the student council\npresident? She’s such a sweet young lady.\r\nShe always says hi when she passes by!
c01_northeast_71	If you come across a beautiful view, don’t forget\nto snap a picture with the camera app.
c01_other_01_01	Are you also the type that likes to chill out on\nrooftops? Well, make sure you don’t fall off.
c01_center_north_99	You can buy academy-approved bags in various\ncolors at this shop!\c\nNow, which color should I choose...?
c01_center_north_100	I need to get my hair styled at Salon Renacer.\nCould you kill some time around here?
c01_center_north_101	Side part, romantic tuck...\c\nThey have some hair styles that almost sound like\nPokémon moves!
c01_center_north_102	Maybe I’ll buy some glasses at the Spec Shack\nand get a new, bespectacled look!
c01_center_north_103	I want to wear a stylish hat! But I also want\npeople to notice my hair!\c\n...Guess I’ll make up my mind inside the shop.
c01_center_north_104	If you get cold feet easily, you need some nice,\nthick socks—and this shop has a great selection!
c01_square_28	They’ve got fruit, vegetables, and even rice!\c\nSure Cans is where to go if you want to buy a ton\nof food and make heaps of sandwiches!
c02.tbl
c02_bottom_02	Good thing we had our Cyclizar to get us across\nthe Asado Desert!
c02_bottom_03	Let’s give both our Cyclizar a nice wash to clean\noff all that sand.
c02_bottom_08	I love my Marill just the way she is, so whenever\nshe starts to evolve, I do a lucky chant to stop it.\c\n“B Button! Put the brakes on this Evolution!”\nIt works every time!
c02_bottom_16	Cascarrafa’s battle court is sunk right into\nthe river!
c02_bottom_18	If you want to head to the upper tiers, just wait\nin front of the elevator here for a moment.
c02_bottom_19	The river gets pretty deep up ahead! ’Course, if\nyou can move across the water, you’re all set!
c02_bottom_20	Porto Marinada is across this desert! Make sure\nyou’re prepared for the trip if you plan to go.
c02_bottom_31	I...I saw a tiny little Pokémon holding a coin!\nWhen I got close, it dropped the coin and ran!\r\nWhat even WAS that thing?
c02_bottom_40	Maybe I should buy something for my Pokémon\nbefore heading home...
c02_bottom_41	Why don’t Pokémon like to eat the same things\nI like to eat? I don’t get it.
c02_bottom_53	The walls look just like cascades of water! I bet\nthey could help train Pokémon to use Waterfall!
c02_bottom_54	Coming from Zapapico, I’m amazed to see how\nmuch water there is around here!\c\nIt’s a precious resource where I’m from.
c02_bottom_60	Marill really love the water! They’re Water-type\nPokémon after all!
c02_bottom_70	Whenever I can’t decide what to eat, I always\nfind myself coming to Jade Palace Garden.
c02_center_01	This spot is for Cyclizar to rest and recharge.\c\nIt’s the least we can do to thank them for carrying\nus around.
c02_center_02	They call Cascarrafa the City of Water! I’m sure\nyou can see why!
c02_center_14	The restaurants here are supposed to be really\ngood! I hear it’s because most of ’em use fresh\r\ningredients brought in from Porto Marinada!
c02_center_29	I want to travel all over the place and take lots of\nphotos while I’m still young.\c\nWhen I’m a little old grandma, I’ll look through\nthem all and remember the good ol’ days.
c02_center_45	Seems like the Kofu Lounge is the most renowned\neatery in Cascarrafa!
c02_center_46	I want to go to the sandwich restaurant on the\nupper level!
c02_center_50	I’m clueless when it comes to map reading...\nWhich way is north again?
c02_center_51	North is shown by the green arc in your map app.\nWhy not try locking it so north always points up?
c02_center_68	Cascarrafa was built on the side of these cliffs!\nThat’s why the city has multiple tiers.
c02_center_98	Hoo boy, what a shopping spree! Where should\nwe head to next?
c02_center_99	Let’s hit the market in Porto Marinada and shop\ntill we drop!
c02_center_111	Oh, Cascarrafa, city of waterrr... ♪\nCarafes are vessels for water, etceteraaa! ♪
c02_center_118	I heard that before they installed elevators here,\nyou had to ride Cyclizar up and down these cliffs\r\nto reach the different tiers! Sounds rough!
c02_center_127	It seems only especially talented people are\nallowed to have one of those Tera Orbs that let\r\nyou Terastallize Pokémon.
c02_center_128	They say that Pokémon can only Terastallize in\nPaldea. Now why on earth might that be?
c02_center_143	Regular folk like us aren’t allowed to set foot\ninside the Great Crater of Paldea...\c\nI wonder what kind of Pokémon are down there?
c02_center_151	Stop on by the Kofu Lounge! The renowned\nrestaurant of Gym Leader Kofu is right here!
c02_center_165	People love coming to Cascarrafa to take photos.\nIt’s such a beautiful city!
c02_center_169	You’re going to school next year, too, right?\nYou think we’ll make lotsa friends?
c02_center_170	I can’t wait to live in the school dorms! I won’t\nget told off for eating candy before bed!
c02_top_01	Tourists started flocking here after we added lots\nof blue around the city.\c\nThe idea apparently came from Kofu himself\na few years ago.
c02_top_07	Every kind of sandwich, any way you want!\nCome on over to Every Wich Way!
c02_top_22	Cascarrafa’s Gym Test is a real doozy!
c02_top_23	Kofu is the face of Cascarrafa! He’s usually a\nmild, easygoing guy, but he shows off his cool\r\nside when he’s doing his Gym Leader thing!
c02_top_31	I’d love to do a big bicycle trip sometime, but\nPaldea has too many mountains and valleys.
c02_top_32	I heard they ride Pokémon other than Cyclizar\nin other regions. Wonder if that’s true?
c02_top_36	I’ve worked my tail off this month... That means\nI can treat myself to a designer handbag, right?
c02_top_38	I fancied trying out a new style, so I changed up\nmy hair! Don’t you think it suits me?
c02_top_39	Errr... Did you get your bangs trimmed?
c03.tbl
c03_south_01	How are you liking Levincia? Business and tech\nare what we pride ourselves on!
c03_south_13	The city’s main street is just north of here!\c\nNothing says “Wow, I’m in Levincia!” like being\nslapdab in the middle of all those neon signs.
c03_south_37	Since we wear socks day in, day out, they just\ngotta be comfy as can be!
c03_south_38	I don’t care if a bag can’t fit much inside, as long\nas it’s stylish!
c03_south_39	So this is Iono’s Gym... I’ve seen it in her videos\nso many times—I can’t believe I’m actually here!
c03_south_43	Did you see the latest episode of Iono Zone?\nThat collab with Tulip was great!
c03_south_44	Iono’s super cute, isn’t she? She’s the most\npopular streamer around, hands down!
c03_south_56	Having greenery around the city is good for our\nwell-being. Sure helps me feel less stressed.
c03_south_57	Life in Levincia is exhilarating. There’s always\nsomething going on!
c03_south_85	Right! Ultra Balls—you got it!\c\nYup, they outperform Great Balls on all counts,\nso I’ll go ahead and put in an order for 300!
c03_south_86	When I grow up, I wanna be an inflooenser too!
c03_south_87	You can make a living doing all sorts of things\nthese days!
c03_south_127	I went to make a sandwich, but I’d run clean out\nof picks! Would you believe it? I go through ’em\r\nso fast, I’d better buy ’em in bulk from now on.
c03_south_147	I could go for the Treasure Eatery in Medali, but\nCascarrafa’s Kofu Lounge also sounds good.\r\nShould we call a Flying Taxi?
c03_south_148	I’m headed out to catch Pokémon later, so I want\nto eat something that’ll give me Catching Power!
c03_center_06	I’m gonna wait till that Pokémon’s flying riiight\nover the ocean, and theeen...SNAP!
c03_center_30	There’s boats ’n’ stuff down there! I wish I could\nsail to the bottom of the sea!
c03_center_39	Levincia feels nice and safe thanks to all the\nsecurity cameras about the place!\c\nI hear the footage they capture is used for the\nGym Test.
c03_center_51	Pottery classes in Alfornada—I’m telling you,\nthat should be our next big project!
c03_center_65	Livestreamed Pokémon battles can be fun to\nwatch, but I want to see them in person, too!
c03_center_69	Ryme’s new track just dropped! I gotta check it\nout ASAP!
c03_center_70	Everything in Tulip’s limited-edition line of\nmakeup is so lovely! I’m spoiled for choice!
c03_center_73	These skyscrapers are crazy tall! My neck hurts\njust trying to take ’em all in!
c03_center_74	Apparently, all five of these buildings are owned\nby a real estate firm called Paldea Realty.
c03_center_78	This city’s electricity is generated by a species of\nPokémon called Tadbulb! What hard workers!
c03_center_79	M-my idol! He’s on the neon signs!!! He pops up\non one screen, then the next...then ANOTHER!\r\nOooh, Brassius...I’m your biggest fan!!!
c03_center_90	You can use a TM Machine to create any TM that\nyou’ve ever gotten before!
c03_center_99	If you had a Pokémon you could ride over water,\nyou could leap into the ocean without a care!
c03_center_100	Levincia started out as a port town that shipped\nore from the mines to various other places.\c\nIt’s hard to believe that humble port went on to\nbecome the high-flying business hub it is today!
c03_center_110	Where did the name Levincia come from? Is it\nfrom that old word “levin”? Or “leviathan”?\c\nOr maybe, ’cause the city has all these soaring\nbuildings in its Million Volt Skyline, could it be\r\nfrom “leaven”? Like, you know, rising bread?
c03_north_21	You remember that famous professor? Haven’t\nseen h[VAR 1107(00FF,0202)]erim on TV or in the papers for a while...
c03_north_22	I heard [VAR 1107(00FF,0001)]she has some sort of lab at the base of\nthe lighthouse over by Cabo Poco.
c03_north_28	Changing up your look also changes up your\nwhole mood!\c\nYour day can go all sorts of ways depending on\nthe clothes you wear.
c03_north_40	OK, we got Potions, sandwich ingredients,\nPoké Balls... Hope we didn’t forget anything!
c03_north_41	We can always take a Flying Taxi back to the\nPoké Mart if we need to.
c03_north_42	[~ 35]
c03_north_71	Iono started out as a streamer quite a few years\nago now... Just how old is she, anyway?
c03_north_75	My Luxio’s fur has a nice sheen to it, huh?\nI always give it a wash first thing after a battle.
c03_north_79	One day, when I’m all grown up and rich, I’ll say\nto the shop man “I’ll take the lot!”
c03_north_86	*munch munch*\c\nI heard the Levincia Gym livestreams the Gym\nTests of all its challengers!
c03_north_87	*gulp gulp*\c\nI watched the Gym’s livestream of a Trainer\nnamed Nemona. Her Pokémon were awesome!
c03_north_95	I heard the academy has mountains of books!\c\nWhen I start studying there, I’m gonna read every\nsingle issue of Occulture!
c03_north_103	If you climb the lighthouse up ahead, you’ll get\na great view over the whole city of Levincia!
c03_north_106	I like photos of scenic places as much as anyone,\nbut the most memorable photos for me are\r\nalways ones of people or Pokémon.
champ_0010.tbl
champ_0010_chairman_01	Very well, Champion Nemona. I trust you to\nhandle this in my stead.[VAR 0114(002C)]
champ_0010_rival_00	Sure thing! You can count on me. In fact, I bet\nthis is gonna be fun![VAR 0114(0004)]

champ_0010_rival_16a	Piqued your interest, huh?

champ_0010_rival_16b	Good eye! She sure is! That lady is... Well, they\ncall her La Primera!\c\nShe’s strong, she can do pretty much anything,\nshe’s got cool practically coming out her ears...\c\nShe’s basically everything I wanna be—or that\nany Pokémon Trainer would wanna be, really![VAR 0114(0004)]
champ_0010_rival_17	Oh! Which reminds me! Remember in homeroom\nwhen I asked what your dream is?[VAR 0114(0004)]

champ_0010_rival_02b	Well, since your heart’s already set on becoming\na really strong Trainer...I’ve got an idea for you![VAR 0114(0004)]

champ_0010_rival_03	You should try to reach [VAR FF00(0006)]Champion Rank[VAR FF00(0000)] like me![VAR 0114(0004)]
champ_0010_slect_01	Yeah, I will!
champ_0010_slect_02	I don’t know...

champ_0010_rival_04b	Aww, but talent like yours deserves to be used!\nHear me out...[VAR 0114(0004)]

champ_0110.tbl
champ_0110_rival_01	You remember how it all works, right? Once you\nget badges from all the Gyms...[VAR 0114(0004)]

champ_0110_chairman_02	It is located to the northwest of Mesagoza.[VAR 0114(0011)]
champ_0110_chairman_03	The Pokémon League is where Trainers are\nreborn as Champions—the greatest honor that\r\nthey might dream of.[VAR 0114(0011)]
champ_0110_rival_03	Collecting eight Gym Badges sets you up to\ntake the Champion Assessment.[VAR 0114(0004)]
champ_0110_rival_04	If you can face the challenge of the final\nexaminer and win, you’ll become a Champion![VAR 0114(0004)]
champ_0110_rival_19	Just imagine how that moment would feel.\nTry getting into that Champion mindset![VAR 0114(0004)]
champ_0110_rival_05	Now, set your sights on reaching that big,\nimportant stage...and let’s battl—[VAR 0114(0004)]
champ_0110_chairman_04	Excuse me one moment.[VAR 0114(0011)]

champ_0110_chairman_06	An amazing display of talent, even against one\nas skilled as Champion Nemona.[VAR 0114(0011)]
champ_0110_chairman_07	That was a splendid match. I enjoyed watching\nvery much.[VAR 0114(0011)]
champ_0110_rival_10	Now even La Primera thinks you’re one to watch.\nYou’ve got so much potential![VAR 0114(0004)]
champ_0110_rival_11	The way you’re going, I better watch my back![VAR 0114(0004)]
champ_0110_rival_12	Did battling in front of La Primera give you the\njitters, maybe?[VAR 0114(0004)]
champ_0110_rival_13	Well, I might’ve won, but it was obvious how\nmuch you’ve bonded with your Pokémon![VAR 0114(0004)]
champ_0110_rival_14	Y’know, since the first time we met, I’ve been\nweirdly sure of one thing...[VAR 0114(0004)]
champ_0110_rival_15	You’re gonna become a Champion—no doubt\nabout it, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0004)]
champ_0110_rival_16	The rest of these Gyms? You can take ’em!\nHundred percent, no problem![VAR 0114(0004)]
champ_0110_chairman_08	I agree. In fact, you should take this. Consider it\nan investment in your future.[VAR 0114(0011)]
champ_0110_chairman_12	If a Pokémon uses that move while Terastallized,\nthe move’s type will change to the Tera Type\r\nof the Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0011)]
champ_0110_rival_17	[VAR BD06(0000)]One day, [VAR 0100(0000)], you and\nme\r\nare\r\ngonna\r\nhave\r\nthe\r\ngreatest\r\nbattle\r\nof\r\nall!\r\nI know it![VAR 0114(0004)]
champ_0110_rival_18	I’m gonna go train up—even more than I already\nhave been![VAR 0114(0004)]
champ_0110_chairman_09	She shows you such support and friendship.\nOr perhaps...\c\nPerhaps she hopes you truly might rival her?[VAR 0114(0011)]
champ_0110_chairman_10	No... I think it’s no mere hope. She seems to have\ncomplete faith that you will catch up to her.[VAR 0114(0011)]
champ_0110_chairman_11	At any rate, allow me to return you to the Gym\nwhere I found you.[VAR 0114(0011)]

champ_0115_ecology_03b	Haha. I get it. Director Clavell doesn’t like\nquestions with easy answers, does he?[VAR 0114(002A)]
champ_0115_ecology_04	Many students choose to make the Gym circuit a\npart of their Treasure Hunt.[VAR 0114(002A)]
champ_0115_ecology_05	It’s no easy feat, but even making the attempt is\na worthwhile experience.[VAR 0114(002A)]
champ_0115_ecology_06	That’s why I was waiting here—to make sure you\nknow your homeroom teacher’s got your back![VAR 0114(002A)]
champ_0115_ecology_07	This should be handy for your Treasure Hunt.[VAR 0114(002A)]
champ_0115_ecology_08	I hope you’ll keep working on that Pokédex of\nyours too—since I did make the app and all![VAR 0114(002A)]

champ_0120_dragon_08	Ahem! In summary, I simply wanted to say that\nyou seem to have gotten even stronger.[VAR 0114(0012)]
champ_0120_dragon_09	I must admit I’m eager for you to gather all\nthe Gym Badges.[VAR 0114(0012)]

champ_0128_rival_02	OK, right... Mm-hmm! Always important to check\nwhat environment your Pokémon’ll be battling in![VAR 0114(0004)]
champ_0128_rival_03	The battlefield can have these teeny effects on\nyour Pokémon’s balance and stuff, y’know?[VAR 0114(0004)]
champ_0128_rival_04	Anyway, sorry I sorta dragged you here. But a\nlittle pre-Gym warming up should do you good![VAR 0114(0004)]

champ_0220_ground_04	Talk about unfair. No way was I ever gonna win\nthat one.[VAR 0114(0013)]
champ_0220_ground_05	Still, though, what a great battle. Felt good even\nto lose![VAR 0114(0013)]
champ_0220_ground_06	Not a whole lot of Trainers have the skill to make\nit past the Elite Test...\c\nBut who knows?[VAR 0114(0013)]
champ_0220_ground_07	I’m beginning to think you might be one of the\nfew that do, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0013)]
champ_0220_ground_08	Better stay on your toes, though—the second of\nthe Elite Four is stronger than me![VAR 0114(0013)]
champ_0220_ground_09	You’re up next, squirt! Come on out![VAR 0114(0013)]

champ_0240_fly_02	I serve as a member of the Elite Four too, yes...\nUnfortunately for me.[VAR 0114(0015)]
champ_0240_fly_03	At my Gym, I use Normal-type Pokémon, since\nI feel they have a lot in common with me.[VAR 0114(0015)]
champ_0240_fly_04	But, well, the boss told me to use a different\ntype here.[VAR 0114(0015)]
champ_0240_fly_05	So if you have any complaints, please take them\nup with La Primera.[VAR 0114(0015)]
champ_0240_fly_06	Anyway, time to get to work.[VAR 0114(0015)]

champ_0250_dragon_02	Young sprouts truly do grow with astounding\nspeed, yes...[VAR 0114(0012)]
champ_0250_dragon_03	But I never for a moment imagined we would be\nfacing each other so soon![VAR 0114(0012)]
champ_0250_dragon_04	Now, a teacher’s duty is to guide students and\naid their growth.[VAR 0114(0012)]

champ_0260_chairman_05	You see, I have a trait that some might say is\ninappropriate for the League Chairwoman...[VAR 0114(0011)]

champ_0270_rival_no_02	C’mon, it’s me! You don’t have to lie! Just tell\nme—you became a Champion, right?![VAR 0114(0004)]
champ_0270_rival_no_03	OK, wait! You DID become a Champion, though,\ndidn’t you?![VAR 0114(0004)]
champ_0270_rival_no_04	You! Champion! Yes?![VAR 0114(0004)]
champ_0270_rival_03	Ha haaa! I knew all along![VAR 0114(0004)]
champ_0270_rival_04	I got word from La Primera when you cleared the\nElite Test![VAR 0114(0004)]
champ_0270_rival_05	[VAR BD06(0000)]Oh man, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nI’m a\r\nChampion,\r\nand\r\nnow,\r\nyou’re\r\na Champion![VAR 0114(0004)]
champ_0270_rival_06	Which means we’re true equals! You and me,\nboth Champion-ranked Trainers! This is amazing![VAR 0114(0004)]
champ_0270_rival_07	Now that you’ve made it here, I’ve got one thing\nto say.[VAR 0114(0004)]
champ_0270_rival_08	Let’s you and me be best rivals for life![VAR 0114(0004)]
champ_0270_rival_no_05	Oops! Couldn’t hear you! I’ll say it again: let’s\nyou and me be best rivals for life![VAR 0114(0004)]
champ_0270_rival_no_06	Sorry, not going to stop until I hear a yes—\nlet’s you and me be best rivals for life![VAR 0114(0004)]
champ_0270_rival_no_07	OK, wait! You WILL be my rival, won’t you?![VAR 0114(0004)]
champ_0270_rival_no_08	You! Me! Rivals! Yes?![VAR 0114(0004)]
champ_0270_rival_09	YESSS! Toma ya![VAR 0114(0004)]
champ_0270_rival_10	All right! You know what rivals do? Battle their\nabsolute hearts out![VAR 0114(0004)]
champ_0270_rival_11	I’m gonna hit you with EVERYTHING this time!\nYou ready?![VAR 0114(0004)]
champ_0270_chairman_01	Do wait a moment, Champion Nemona.[VAR 0114(0011)]
champ_0270_rival_12	Huh? What’s the matter, Primera?[VAR 0114(0004)]
champ_0270_chairman_02a	[VAR BD06(0000)]The Champion Assessment has only just ended.\nI believe a rest is in order for Champion\r\n[VAR 0100(0000)],\r\n[VAR 0101(0001)],\r\nand\r\nthe others.[VAR 0114(0011)]
champ_0270_chairman_02b	[VAR BD06(0000)]The Champion Assessment has only just ended.\nI believe a rest is in order for Champion\r\n[VAR 0100(0000)]\r\nand [VAR 0101(0001)].[VAR 0114(0011)]
champ_0270_chairman_03	Champions must be understanding toward\ntheir opponents.[VAR 0114(0011)]
champ_0270_rival_13	Urk. Right...[VAR 0114(0004)]
champ_0270_rival_14	[VAR BD06(0000)]There I go getting overexcited again! Sorry,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]\r\nand\r\n[VAR 0101(0001)].[VAR 0114(0004)]
champ_0270_chairman_04	I also must ask—is this roadside really the setting\nyou two want for your first battle as true equals\r\nand rivals?[VAR 0114(0011)]
champ_0270_rival_15	Hmm... Now that you mention it, that’s a\ngood point.[VAR 0114(0004)]
champ_0270_rival_16	In that case, can we use one of the Pokémon\nLeague battle courts?[VAR 0114(0004)]
champ_0270_chairman_05	Surely there’s somewhere more fitting. A place\nwith special meaning for the two of you, perhaps.[VAR 0114(0011)]
champ_0270_rival_17	Special meaning, huh? Hmm... Let me see...\nAnywhere leap to mind, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0004)]
champ_0270_select_a	Out behind your house
champ_0270_select_b	Mesagoza
champ_0270_select_c	The Treasure Eatery
champ_0270_rival_answer_a01	Haha! Our beach out back, huh? Yeah, the place\nwhere we had our first battle might work.[VAR 0114(0004)]
champ_0270_rival_answer_a02	But on the other hand, to me it’s just kind of...\nmy backyard, y’know? A little ordinary.[VAR 0114(0004)]
champ_0270_rival_answer_a03	Anyplace else come to mind?[VAR 0114(0004)]
champ_0270_chairman_answer_c01	The Treasure Eatery? Is it significant to the two of\nyou somehow?[VAR 0114(0011)]
champ_0270_chairman_answer_c02	Ah, are you thinking of it ’cause it’s got the\nMedali Gym’s battle court?\c\nI guess it does bring back memories...of Larry...[VAR 0114(0004)]
champ_0270_chairman_answer_c03	Larry may not appreciate the surprise visit.\c\nIf you’ve any other suitable places in mind, would\nyou prioritize them instead, please?[VAR 0114(0011)]
champ_0270_rival_18	Mesagoza? Oooh, good call! The place where we\nset out on our journey![VAR 0114(0004)]
champ_0270_rival_19	That reminds me, [VAR 0100(0000)]...\c\nRemember back when Director Clavell explained\nthe [VAR FF00(0006)]Treasure Hunt[VAR FF00(0000)]? Y’know how he told us to go\r\nin search of our own treasure?[VAR 0114(0004)]
champ_0270_rival_20	Well, I know what treasure I got out of all this:\nI found a true rival—someone who can stand up\r\nto me at my full capabilities.[VAR 0114(0004)]
champ_0270_rival_21	That’s right—I mean you! I’m so glad I got to\nmeet you, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0004)]
champ_0270_rival_22	Anyway, that being said...[VAR 0114(0004)]
champ_0270_rival_23	I’ll be waiting for you at the battle court in\nMesagoza’s central plaza! See ya there![VAR 0114(0004)]
champ_0270_chairman_06	The respect you two share is palpable. Even a bit\nenviable, to be honest.[VAR 0114(0011)]
champ_0270_chairman_07	I am known as La Primera—but even when facing\nme in the final test of her Champion Assessment,\r\nChampion Nemona didn’t reveal her full might.[VAR 0114(0011)]
champ_0270_chairman_08	In you, I suspect she has found someone she can\nbattle without holding anything back.[VAR 0114(0011)]
champ_0280.tbl
champ_0280_rival_01	Any second now...[VAR 0114(0004)]
champ_0280_rival_02	Ah![VAR 0114(0004)]
champ_0280_rival_03	There you are, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0004)]
champ_0280_rival_04	You ready for a battle between Champions?[VAR 0114(0004)]
champ_0280_rival_05	’Cause all these folks here seem ready to watch.\nWord got around, I guess![VAR 0114(0004)]
champ_0280_rival_06	And out of every single person gathered here...[VAR 0114(0004)]
champ_0280_rival_10	I’m the most excited by a mile![VAR 0114(0004)]
champ_0280_rival_11	The stage is set![VAR 0114(0004)]
champ_0280_rival_07	It’s my all-out power...[VAR 0114(0004)]
champ_0280_rival_08	versus your strength in full fruition![VAR 0114(0004)]
champ_0280_rival_09	Let’s see who comes out on top![VAR 0114(0004)]

champ_0290_rival_01	You...[VAR 0114(0004)]
champ_0290_rival_02	YOU DID IT![VAR 0114(0004)]
champ_0290_rival_03	This is legit incredible! You’re the strongest out\nthere, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0004)]
champ_0290_rival_04	I mean, you knocked me flat, and I was giving\nyou absolutely everything I had![VAR 0114(0004)]
champ_0290_rival_05	Everything I...[VAR 0114(0004)]
champ_0290_rival_06	I...[VAR 0114(0004)]
champ_0290_rival_07	Ha haaa! Hahaha![VAR 0114(0004)]
champ_0290_rival_08	Oh man. Pokémon battling, am I right?[VAR 0114(0004)]
champ_0290_rival_09	It’s so much better—so much more fun than I ever\neven knew![VAR 0114(0004)]
champ_0290_rival_10	Thanks for that incredible match. You beat me\nfor real this time![VAR 0114(0004)]
champ_0290_rival_11	Now let’s give ourselves a minute and have a\nquick break, [VAR 0100(0000)]...[VAR 0114(0004)]
champ_0290_rival_12	before round two![VAR 0114(0004)]
champ_0290_rival_13	Which Pokémon should I bring out this time?\nDecisions, decisions![VAR 0114(0004)]

class_a_01.tbl
class_a_01_ecology_01	Hello, hello. My name’s Jacq, and I’ll be your\nPokémon biology teacher.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_01_ecology_02	In my class, we’ll all learn about the various\nquirks of our beloved Pokémon together![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_01_ecology_03	I hope you all come to love Pokémon even more\nfrom the things you learn here.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_01_ecology_04	In today’s class, I’ll teach you a great way to\nget to know Pokémon in more depth.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_01_ecology_05	If you’d like to become better friends with your\nPokémon...[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_01_ecology_06	you can let them come out of their Poké Ball\nand walk along with you! Sounds great, huh?[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_01_ecology_07	You can use the [VAR FF00(0006)]ZR Button[VAR FF00(0000)] to throw a Poké Ball\nand let out the Pokémon inside.\c\nNothing cuter than watching your Pokémon run\naround underfoot, if you ask me.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_01_ecology_08	Once you let your Pokémon out, try speaking to\nthem—they’re sure to respond in some way.\r\nIt’s a great way to get to know them better![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_01_ecology_09	However! Letting your Pokémon out of its ball\nisn’t such a great idea in some locations.\c\nCan anyone tell me where it is that you shouldn’t\nhave your Pokémon walk along with you?[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_01_select_01	Near the water
class_a_01_select_02	Inside buildings
class_a_01_select_03	In tall grass
class_a_01_ecology_answer_01	It’s certainly true that some Pokémon aren’t fond\nof water, but we do have floating platforms they\r\ncan use, so being near water isn’t an issue.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_01_ecology_answer_02	[VAR BD06(0000)]That’s right! Great job, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nI see\r\nyou\r\ndid\r\nyour\r\nhomework.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_01_ecology_answer_03	Pokémon love tall grass! I can’t see them having\nany problem walking with you there.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_01_ecology_10	The correct answer is that we should not walk\nwith our Pokémon indoors. How about that![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_01_ecology_11	Some Pokémon might damage walls, desks, and\nother things walking around inside buildings, so\r\nit’s not allowed regardless of the species.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_01_ecology_12	Therefore, please only let your Pokémon out of\ntheir Poké Balls while outdoors. OK, everyone?\c\nI think I see them out and about in classrooms\nfrom time to time, but still...[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_01_ecology_13	Anyway, you may become even closer friends\nwith your Pokémon pals by walking together![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_01_ecology_14	Oh! I almost forgot—keep in mind that you can\nonly walk together with your lead Pokémon.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_01_ecology_15	Remember—use the [VAR FF00(0006)]ZR Button[VAR FF00(0000)] to throw a ball\nand let out the Pokémon inside.\c\nYou’ll also want to remember that throwing a\nball at a wild Pokémon will start a battle![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_01_ecology_16	It looks like that’s all the time we have for today.\nSee you all next class![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_02.tbl
class_a_02_ecology_01_old_00	Hello, hello. I hope everyone’s ready to learn\nsome new things today![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_02_ecology_02_old_00	Did you all try using the ZR Button to let your\nPokémon out as I taught you in our last class?[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_02_ecology_03	Walking along with your Pokémon lets you see\nhow unique and cute they all are.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_02_ecology_04	I’d also highly recommend picnics for when you\nwant to spend some quality time together with\r\nthe Pokémon in your party.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_02_ecology_05	You can get them all around the table to make\nsandwiches and play—it’s really a lot of fun![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_02_ecology_06	If you want to learn more about making food,\nMr. Saguaro’s class is the best place to go![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_02_ecology_07	Now, sometimes, while you’re enjoying a picnic\nwith your Pokémon...[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_02_ecology_08	you may find something very, VERY important in\nthe basket next to your table![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_02_ecology_09	This very important something is what Pokémon\nare born from. Let’s all say it together![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_02_select_01	Boxes!
class_a_02_select_02	Poké Balls!
class_a_02_select_03	Eggs!
class_a_02_ecology_answer_01	[VAR BD06(0000)]Huh? Um...[VAR 0100(0000)], it looks\nlike\r\nyou’re\r\nthe\r\nonly\r\none\r\nwho\r\nsaid Boxes.\c\nWe sometimes send Pokémon to Boxes for\nsafekeeping, but they’re not born from them![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_02_ecology_answer_02	[VAR BD06(0000)]Huh? Um...[VAR 0100(0000)], it looks\nlike\r\nyou’re\r\nthe\r\nonly\r\none\r\nwho\r\nsaid\r\nPoké Balls!\c\nI don’t believe there have been any Pokémon\ndiscovered yet that are born from Poké Balls![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_02_ecology_answer_03	Phew! You all got it right![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_02_ecology_10	The very important something I’m talking about\nis...a Pokémon Egg![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_02_ecology_11	It’s not clear where these Eggs come from, but\nthey’re probably placed in the basket rather\r\nstealthily by the Pokémon at the picnic.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_02_ecology_12	Walking around with an Egg will help warm it,\nwhich allows it to hatch.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_02_ecology_13	Eggs won’t warm up by sitting in Boxes, though.\nYou need to have them in your party![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_02_ecology_14	And here’s one more super important thing I’d\nlike you to remember about Eggs.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_02_ecology_15	Pokémon entrust us with their Eggs because they\nbelieve in us![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_02_ecology_16	So, I sure would be happy to see you all being\nresponsible parents for your little Pokémon Eggs![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_02_ecology_17	Whoops. My most important point came right as\nthe bell rang. Well, see you all next time, I guess![VAR 0114(002A)]

class_a_03_ecology_01	Hello, hello. I hope everyone’s ready to learn\nsome new things today![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_03_ecology_02	I seem to remember teaching you all about the\nimportance of Eggs in our last class together.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_03_ecology_03	Ah, on that note, is everyone using their\nPokédex?[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_03_ecology_04	It registers Pokémon born from Eggs as well as\nthose encountered via other methods, so don’t\r\nyou worry about that![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_03_ecology_05	And, uh, hehe...just so you know, I’m the one who\ndeveloped the Pokédex app![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_03_ecology_06	It was waaay before I started teaching here at the\nacademy, though.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_03_ecology_07	Back then, I was a researcher.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_03_ecology_08	In fact, Director Clavell wasn’t working in\neducation at the time, either!\c\nHe was researching alongside me at the\nsame facility.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_03_ecology_09	We got to research Pokémon together day in,\nday out... Those sure were fun times.\c\nI got yelled at all the time, though. Heh.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_03_ecology_10	Wait a second, how did I get onto this?\nPretty sure I was talking about the Pokédex...[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_03_ecology_11	Uh... Anyway! Today, I’d like to teach you about\ncatching Pokémon.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_03_ecology_12	As you all know, a great way to catch a Pokémon\nmore easily is to first lower its HP.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_03_ecology_13	But there’s another way to up your chances of a\nsuccessful catch. Can you guess what it is?[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_03_select_01	Give the Pokémon a Berry
class_a_03_select_02	Inflict the Pokémon with a status condition
class_a_03_select_03	Prove you’re stronger than the Pokémon
class_a_03_ecology_answer_01	Huh? Hmmm... Maybe that’s a bit of advice from\nanother region?\c\nThe common understanding here in Paldea may\nbe a little different.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_03_ecology_answer_02	[VAR BD06(0000)]Wow! That’s right, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nGreat job![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_03_ecology_answer_03	That’s a rough-and-tumble way to look at things,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]...\c\nI guess it’s true that sending out a strong\nPokémon can turn a battle in your favor, though.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_03_ecology_14	The correct technique for making Pokémon easier\nto catch is to inflict them with a status condition.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_03_ecology_15	Sleep is an especially effective status condition.\nIt makes Pokémon drastically easier to catch![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_03_ecology_16	If you have a Pokémon that can use moves that\nput opponents to sleep, like Sleep Powder or\r\nHypnosis, filling up your Pokédex will be a cinch![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_03_ecology_17	There are other ways to improve your catch rate\nas well, like using Poké Balls specifically designed\r\nto be effective against certain Pokémon.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_03_ecology_18	Eating food that gives you Catching Power works,\ntoo—or sneaking up on Pokémon from behind to\r\ncatch them by surprise when you start a battle![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_03_ecology_19	If you’re having trouble, you may want to make\nthe rounds to the Gyms to get Gym Badges.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_03_ecology_20	Earning Gym Badges will make it easier to catch\nPokémon of higher and higher levels![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_03_ecology_21	Please do come show me your Pokédexes once\nthey start to fill up![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_03_ecology_22	Another day, another enjoyable class. Oh yeah,\ndon’t forget—our next class will be a test![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_04.tbl
class_a_04_ecology_01	Hello, hello, everyone. Today is our\nmidterm exam.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_04_ecology_02	It sure feels good to fill in all those empty spaces\non the answer sheet, doesn’t it?[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_04_ecology_03	Take your time, and contemplate each\nquestion carefully.[VAR 0114(002A)]

class_a_04_ansewer_04c_00	D) Using certain kinds of Poké Balls

class_a_04_question_06	—This question won’t affect your grade!—\n\nHow do you like the Pokédex? Is it easy to use?\nI’d be happy to hear your honest opinions!
class_a_04_ansewer_06a	It’s easy to use!
class_a_04_ansewer_06b	It’s all right
class_a_04_ansewer_06c	I don’t use it that much...
class_a_04_ecology_04	All right, everyone! Time’s up! I hope you all\nenjoyed tackling those questions![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_04_ecology_05	That last question was just something that I’m\npersonally curious to know.\c\nDon’t tell the director about it, OK?[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_04_ecology_06	I’ll grade these right away. I hope you’re all\nlooking forward to seeing how you did![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_05.tbl
class_a_05_ecology_01	Hello, hello. I hope everyone’s ready to learn\nsome new things today![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_05_ecology_02	You all did really great on the midterm exam![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_05_ecology_03	Thanks for answering my little question at the\nend, too.\c\nI’ll be sure to keep your responses in mind.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_05_ecology_04	All right! We’re now heading into the last half\nof our classes together.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_05_ecology_05	It’s time for our knowledge to evolve and grow—\njust like our Pokémon![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_05_ecology_06	Evolution...yep. Haha! Evolution![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_05_ecology_07	Today we’re going to learn about the fascinating\nphenomenon of Pokémon Evolution![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_05_ecology_08	As your Pokémon battle and level up, they learn\nmoves and get stronger.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_05_ecology_09	And for some Pokémon, once they’ve leveled up\nenough...[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_05_ecology_10	their appearance changes, and their stats\nincrease—sometimes by a lot![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_05_ecology_11	That’s Pokémon Evolution![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_05_ecology_12	Pokémon become very strong when they evolve,\nmaking them trusty partners in battle.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_05_ecology_13	But! Some people prefer to keep their Pokémon\nin their adorable pre-evolved states.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_05_ecology_14	To do this, you just need to remember a certain\nbutton when your Pokémon begins to evolve.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_05_ecology_15	Say it with me if you already know! To cancel\nEvolution, press the...[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_05_select_01	A Button!
class_a_05_select_02	B Button!
class_a_05_select_03	C Button!
class_a_05_ecology_answer_01	[VAR BD06(0000)]Huh? Um...[VAR 0100(0000)], you may\nbe\r\nthinking\r\nof\r\nsomething else.\c\nThe A Button has more of a decisive feel to it.\nKinda like “A-OK!” don’t you think?[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_05_ecology_answer_02	That’s right, everyone! “B” for “best answer!”[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_05_ecology_answer_03	[VAR BD06(0000)]Huh? Um...[VAR 0100(0000)], you may\nbe\r\nthinking\r\nof\r\nsomething else.\c\nThe C Button... That has a bit of a nostalgic feel\nto it, don’t you think?[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_05_ecology_16	The button you want when you need to stop a\nPokémon from evolving is the B Button![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_05_ecology_17	If you press this button soon after a Pokémon\nbegins to evolve, you can stop it from changing.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_05_ecology_18	You can also let the Pokémon hold an item known\nas an Everstone to keep it from evolving.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_05_ecology_19	And keep in mind that the requirements for\nEvolution differ from Pokémon to Pokémon.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_05_ecology_20	Some may evolve by having a certain item, such\nas a Fire Stone or Thunder Stone, used on them.\c\nOthers may have to learn a specific move or\ndefeat a specific Pokémon in battle to evolve.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_05_ecology_21	The way Primeape evolves into Annihilape is\nespecially strange.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_05_ecology_22	You see, there’s a certain move that—[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_05_ecology_23	Whoops. Sorry, looks like we’re out of time![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_05_ecology_24	I guess we’ll have to end the class there today.\nThank you all for your attention![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_06.tbl
class_a_06_ecology_01	Hello, hello. I hope everyone’s ready to learn\nsome new things today![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_06_ecology_02	But before we get going, do you all remember\nthe final question from our midterm exam?[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_06_ecology_03	Well, Director Clavell found out about it\nsomehow, and I got yelled at. Whoops.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_06_ecology_04	Apparently he could tell I was hiding something\njust by looking at me.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_06_ecology_05	He must’ve noticed all the color flush right out of\nmy face! Haha![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_06_ecology_06	Speaking of color, today I’d like to teach you\nall about colors as they pertain to Pokémon![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_06_ecology_07	Some Pokémon have slightly different coloration\nor patterning on their bodies based on their\r\ngender or individual differences.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_06_ecology_08	In very rare cases, a Pokémon may have wildly\ndifferent coloration compared to others of the\r\nsame species.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_06_ecology_09	We call these specimens [VAR FF00(0006)]Shiny [VAR FF00(0000)]Pokémon.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_06_ecology_10	It is quite rare to cross paths with one.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_06_ecology_11	Does anyone here know what the likelihood of\nfinding a Shiny Pokémon is?[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_06_select_01	1 in 40
class_a_06_select_02	1 in 400
class_a_06_select_03	1 in 4,000
class_a_06_ecology_answer_01	It would be nice if they were that common! We\nwould be able to do far more research on them.\r\nBut they’re actually quite a bit more rare.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_06_ecology_answer_02	That’s not a bad guess. But they’re actually\neven rarer than 1 in 400![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_06_ecology_answer_03	Wow! That’s right! You may have the makings of a\nPokémon Professor, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_06_ecology_12	Shiny Pokémon appear at a rate of 1 in 4,000.\nIsn’t that amazing?[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_06_ecology_13	The probability of encountering one in the wild is\nthe same as hatching one from an Egg, too![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_06_ecology_14	Eggs from a pair of Pokémon raised around\ndiffering languages are a special case.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_06_ecology_15	There is a higher than average chance that\na Shiny Pokémon will hatch from these Eggs.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_06_ecology_16	But we haven’t been able to figure out why that is\njust yet.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_06_ecology_17	I’ve also heard rumors of a charm that increases\nyour likelihood of finding Shiny Pokémon when\r\nyou have it in your Bag—can you believe that?![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_06_ecology_18	This claim can’t be scientifically verified, but it\nsure would be fun if it were true.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_06_ecology_19	Whoops...there’s the bell.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_06_ecology_20	That’s all for today. Thank you for your attention![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_07.tbl
class_a_07_ecology_01	Hello, hello. I hope everyone’s ready to learn\nsome new things today![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_07_ecology_02	Next time we meet, we’ll have our final exam.\nThat means today is our last actual class.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_07_ecology_03	And the topic for this last class will be...Pokémon\n[VAR FF00(0006)]forms[VAR FF00(0000)]! You can just think of forms as the shapes\r\nor appearances that Pokémon have.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_07_ecology_04	There’s also a phenomenon called a [VAR FF00(0006)]form[VAR FF00(0000)]\n[VAR FF00(0006)]change[VAR FF00(0000)], where a Pokémon’s appearance\r\nchanges under certain conditions.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_07_ecology_05	Cyclizar, for example, which we regularly ride on\nas transportation here in Paldea, has three forms.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_07_ecology_06	First is its basic form, where it walks on four\nlegs. Second is its battle form, where it stands\r\non its hind legs to engage in battle.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_07_ecology_07	Finally, there’s its ride form, where it inflates its\nthroat sac and its tail so we can ride on its back.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_07_ecology_08	Though we can use something you’re all carrying\nwith you now as an even better example![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_07_ecology_09	Yup, I’m talking about your phones! Some\nsmartphones are inhabited by a certain Pokémon.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_07_ecology_10	Does anyone know the Pokémon I’m referring to?[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_07_select_01	Rotom
class_a_07_select_02	Pikachu
class_a_07_select_03	Heracross
class_a_07_ecology_answer_01	You’re a regular expert on Pokémon AND\ntechnology, aren’t you, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_07_ecology_answer_02	It sure would be adorable if it were Pikachu in\nour phones—and it would probably make us want\r\nto walk around more, too!\c\nBut too bad, that’s not the right answer![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_07_ecology_answer_03	[VAR BD06(0000)]Haha! I see where you’re coming from,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nHeracross can learn a move called Smart Strike!\nSmartphone, Smart Strike... Well, unfortunately,\r\nthere’s no connection![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_07_ecology_11	The Pokémon inside your smartphone is Rotom,\nand it does all sorts of things to help you out.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_07_ecology_12	A Rotom inside a Rotom Phone is special, so it\ndoesn’t try to enter other electronics.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_07_ecology_13	An ordinary Rotom, however, can change form by\nentering washing machines, microwave ovens,\r\nand other electronic appliances.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_07_ecology_14	Rotom is a bit of an exception, though. Many\nPokémon that change form do so simply by\r\nholding an item or by having one used on them.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_07_ecology_15	Oricorio, for example, has four different forms it\ncan change between when given certain nectars.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_07_ecology_16	Pokémon may even change type or learn\ndifferent moves when they change form.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_07_ecology_17	Form changes are different from Evolution in that\nthe Pokémon can return to its original form.\c\nAnd unlike Shiny Pokémon, which can’t change\ntheir special coloration, the same individual\r\nPokémon can go back and forth between\r\nits forms.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_07_ecology_18	There’s a lot to dig into with this form change\nphenomenon, as you can see![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_07_ecology_19	We can all learn something from Pokémon\nhere, don’t you think? Bit of a stretch, but...[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_07_ecology_20	I’d be happy to see you all enjoy your time at\nthe academy to the fullest...and change form\r\ninto a new version of yourselves![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_07_ecology_21	Or something like that, anyway![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_07_ecology_22	Oh! I almost forgot![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_07_ecology_23	Regional forms, which vary based on what region\na Pokémon came from, don’t change like other\r\nforms. They’re an innate—[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_07_ecology_24	Whoops. Heh...there’s the bell.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_07_ecology_25	I guess I was scatterbrained Mr. Jacq right up to\nthe very end, huh?\c\nI had a great time teaching all of you. I hope\nyou’ll do your best on the final exam![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_08.tbl
class_a_08_ecology_01	Hello hello, everyone. Today is our final exam.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_08_ecology_02	It will cover everything I’ve taught you so far! But\nI’m sure you all will do just fine.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_08_ecology_03	Take your time, and contemplate each question\ncarefully.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_08_question_01	1. How many of the following four methods\n    make it easier to catch a Pokémon?\n\n    ・Inflicting paralysis   ・Using a Poké Toy\n    ・Feeding it a Berry   ・Surprising it from behind
class_a_08_ansewer_01a	One
class_a_08_ansewer_01b	Two
class_a_08_ansewer_01c	Three
class_a_08_ansewer_01d	Four
class_a_08_question_02	2. True or false? You can get new Pokémon\n    only by catching them yourself or trading\n    with other Trainers.
class_a_08_ansewer_02a	True
class_a_08_ansewer_02b	False
class_a_08_question_03	3. If a Pokémon is holding an Everstone, will\n    using an item that induces Evolution, such as\n    a Fire Stone, cause it to evolve?\n\nA) Yes, it will\nB) No, it won’t
class_a_08_ansewer_03a	A) Yes, it will
class_a_08_ansewer_03b	B) No, it won’t
class_a_08_question_04	4. What is the probability of running into a\n    Shiny Pokémon?\n\nA) 1 in 2,000\nB) 1 in 4,000\nC) 1 in 6,000
class_a_08_ansewer_04a	A) 1 in 2,000
class_a_08_ansewer_04b	B) 1 in 4,000
class_a_08_ansewer_04c	C) 1 in 6,000
class_a_08_question_05	5. True or false? The Pokémon known as Oricorio\n    has three forms.
class_a_08_ansewer_05a	True
class_a_08_ansewer_05b	False
class_a_08_question_06	—This question won’t affect your grade!—\n\nDo you have anything you would like to say\nabout my class? I’m still getting used to this\nteaching thing, but I sure had fun as your teacher!
class_a_08_ansewer_06a	It was fun!
class_a_08_ansewer_06b	Thank you for being our teacher!
class_a_08_ansewer_06c	Keep teaching! You can do it!
class_a_08_ecology_04	OK! Time’s up whether you like it or not! I hope\neveryone enjoyed tackling those questions![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_08_ecology_05	Hehe... I snuck in a little bonus question there\nright at the end again. Shhh, our little secret—\r\ndon’t tell the director![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_08_ecology_06	I’ll grade these right away. I hope you’re all\nlooking forward to seeing how you did![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_b_01.tbl
class_b_01_math_01	Hello, everyone. Nice to meet you. My name’s\nTyme, and I will be your math teacher.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_01_math_02	Sorry to put you all on the spot at the start of\nclass, but let me ask you a quick question—\r\nDo you enjoy numbers, arithmetic, and the like?[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_01_popup_01	Yeah!
class_b_01_popup_02	Sort of.
class_b_01_popup_03	Errr...
class_b_01_math_03	Oh, my. Hahaha. Thank you for your honest\nresponses.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_01_math_04	Some of you may like numbers, and some may\nnot. I think that makes a wonderful mix.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_01_math_05	But no matter your opinion on math, I hope you\nfind yourselves enjoying our lessons together!\c\nI’ll do my best to find a good way to match up\nyour interests with all types of math lessons![VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_01_math_06	Speaking of which, are you all caught up on your\nstudies of Pokémon type matchups?[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_01_math_07	For example, Grass is strong against Water, and\nWater is strong against Fire, correct?[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_01_math_08	[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 0100(0000)], you seem to\nbe\r\ngood\r\nwith\r\nPokémon,\r\nso\r\nlet\r\nme\r\nask\r\nyou this...[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_01_math_09	Bearing in mind that Water is strong against Fire...\nIf the move Water Gun hits a Fire-type Pokémon,\r\nwhat becomes of the move’s damage?[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_01_select_01	It’s cut in half
class_b_01_select_02	It doesn’t change
class_b_01_select_03	It’s doubled
class_b_01_math_answer_01	Oh, my. A little reverse thinking, I see! But I’d\nprobably be in rough shape afterward if I got hit\r\nby something I was weak to. Wouldn’t you be?[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_01_math_answer_02	A real hardy individual, I see! But I’d probably\nbe in rough shape afterward if I got hit by\r\nsomething I was weak to. Wouldn’t you be?[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_01_math_answer_03	That’s right! I knew I could count on you for this\nquestion, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_01_math_10	Using moves of a type that your opponent is\nweak to is a supereffective tactic!\c\nIt multiplies the damage of those moves by two![VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_01_math_11	On the other hand, using moves of a type that\nyour opponent is resistant to isn’t very effective.\r\nIt divides the damage of your moves by two.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_01_math_12	Haha! I don’t mean to encroach on Ms. Dendra’s\nbattle studies territory, of course, but I thought\r\nit best to use a lively topic as an example.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_01_math_13	That can make math fun even for those of you\nwho don’t much like the subject, don’t you think?[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_01_math_14	Oh, my. Is that the bell? I suppose that’s all for\nnow. What a shame...[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_01_math_15	I’m looking forward to seeing you all in the next\nclass. I hope you’re looking forward to it, too![VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_02.tbl
class_b_02_math_01	Hello, everyone. Let’s have a fun class today.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_02_math_02	Tell me, do you all enjoy shopping?[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_02_math_03	Buying tasty bread or choosing new clothes—\neven just window shopping is so much fun![VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_02_math_04	In today’s class, I’d like to use shopping—one of\nmy own favorite hobbies, mind you—to teach\r\nyou all about math![VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_02_math_05	I’m sure everyone here has visited a Poké Mart at\nleast once. They sell all sorts of Pokémon items![VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_02_math_06	Poké Balls are one of the many useful items you\ncan find there. They cost 200 each.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_02_math_07	Now then, I’d like you all to do some thinking\nwith me here![VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_02_math_08	One Poké Ball is 200. If you had 2,000 and\nbought as many Poké Balls as you could afford,\r\nhow many would you receive?[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_02_select_01	Nine
class_b_02_select_02	Ten
class_b_02_select_03	Eleven
class_b_02_math_answer_01	[VAR BD06(0000)]Oh, my. That guess falls a little short,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_02_math_answer_02	[VAR BD06(0000)]Oh dear. I’m sorry, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nI suppose\r\nthis\r\nwas\r\na bit\r\nof a\r\ntrick question.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_02_math_answer_03	[VAR BD06(0000)]That’s correct! Well done,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_02_math_09	With 2,000, you can afford to purchase a\nmaximum of 10 Poké Balls...[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_02_math_10	However! If you purchase 10 or more of any one\ntype of Poké Ball...[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_02_math_11	You will also receive one Premier Ball—a special\nwhite ball—as a bonus![VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_02_math_12	So the correct answer is, in fact, 11![VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_02_math_13	It sure is nice to get a little bonus like that on a\nshopping trip, isn’t it?[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_02_math_14	Oh, my. Is that the bell? I suppose that’s all for\nnow. What a shame...[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_02_math_15	I’m looking forward to seeing you all in the next\nclass. I hope you’re looking forward to it, too![VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_03.tbl
class_b_03_math_01	Hello, everyone. Let’s have a fun class today.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_03_math_02	Tell me, do you all enjoy fortune telling,\nhoroscopes, and the like?[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_03_math_03	I think it feels great to read your horoscope and\nsee that it says good luck is coming your way.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_03_math_04	So today, I’d like to teach you all math while\nfocusing on the topic of luck![VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_03_math_05	Perhaps you have seen the following phrase\ncrop up during Pokémon battles before...\c\n“A critical hit!”[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_03_math_06	When a Pokémon’s attack lands as a critical hit,\nthe damage it deals is increased by half.\c\nIn other words, it does one-and-a-half times as\nmuch damage as it normally would![VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_03_math_07	It is truly luck that determines whether your\nPokémon lands a critical hit—or has one landed\r\non it. This can cause a great upset in battle.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_03_math_08	Does anyone know what percent chance a\nPokémon has of landing a critical hit?[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_03_select_01	About 1 percent (1 in 100 hits)
class_b_03_select_02	About 4 percent (4 in 100 hits)
class_b_03_select_03	About 12 percent (12 in 100 hits)
class_b_03_math_answer_01	Oh, my. Critical hits land a little more often than\nthat, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_03_math_answer_02	[VAR BD06(0000)]That is correct! Well done,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_03_math_answer_03	Oh, my. That might cause a bit TOO critical of a\nsituation, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_03_math_09	The chance of landing a critical hit is said to be\n1 in 24...which figures to roughly 4.17 percent.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_03_math_10	The odds are more favorable for certain moves,\nthough—why, moves such as Stone Edge and\r\nShadow Claw have about a 12 percent chance![VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_03_math_11	You can also use a move called Focus Energy or\nan item known as a Dire Hit.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_03_math_12	Both raise the critical-hit ratio by two stages—\nthat’s a 50 percent chance to land a critical hit![VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_03_math_13	It feels great to land a critical hit, but perhaps\nnot so great to be struck by one![VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_03_math_14	There is a surprising amount of mathematical\nprobability hidden in Pokémon battles, you know.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_03_math_15	If you’re able to do the calculations that’ll swing\nluck in your favor, it may open the door for more\r\nstrategic choices for you during battle.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_03_math_16	Oh, my. Is that the bell? I suppose that’s all for\nnow. What a shame...[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_03_math_17	Next class will be our fun midterm exam! I hope\nyou’ll all be looking forward to it.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_04.tbl
class_b_04_math_01	All right, everyone. It’s time to begin our\nmidterm exam.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_04_math_02	I’m sure the fun experiences you all had in my\nclass will serve you well as you answer![VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_04_question_01	1. How much damage does Water Gun do when\n    it hits a Fire-type Pokémon?\n\nA) Half damage\nB) Normal damage\nC) Double damage

class_b_04_math_03	All right, everyone. Time is up! Put your hands\non your laps, now.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_04_math_04	You were all concentrating so hard. I can’t wait to\nsee how you did.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_04_math_05	Do go and ask for your scores at the front desk\nand then take a nice break.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_05.tbl
class_b_05_math_01	Hello, everyone. Well done on the midterm exam.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_05_math_02	Some of you earned perfect scores, and others\nseemed to have a bit of trouble, but I can tell\r\nthat you all tried your best.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_05_math_03	I am quite pleased to say that every last one of\nyou passed.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_05_math_04	I can only assume that this means you have all\ncome to love numbers![VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_05_math_05	Stay sharp, and try your best for the rest of my\nclasses, too![VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_05_math_06	Speaking of staying “sharp,” do you know how\nthat word applies to Pokémon battles?\r\nThat’s right—it has to do with stat boosts![VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_05_math_07	A Pokémon’s stats can rise and fall throughout\nthe course of battle, correct?[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_05_math_08	For example, if a Pokémon uses the move\nWork Up, its Attack and Sp. Atk stats will rise by\r\none stage each.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_05_math_09	And, as you may know, each time a Pokémon’s\nAttack or Sp. Atk rises one stage, moves affected\r\nby that stat will deal 50 percent more damage.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_05_math_10	If that same Pokémon from our previous example\nwere to use Work Up again, both its Attack and\r\nSp. Atk will have risen by two stages total.\c\nThis results in a 100 percent increase to damage\ndealt, making its moves twice as strong![VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_05_math_11	Swords Dance, on the other hand, boosts Attack\nby two stages at once, allowing the Pokémon to\r\ndeal double damage after just a single use![VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_05_math_12	Using Swords Dance twice would boost the\nPokémon’s Attack stat by four stages. How much\r\nmore damage, then, would this Pokémon deal?[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_05_select_01	Double damage
class_b_05_select_02	Triple damage
class_b_05_select_03	Quadruple damage
class_b_05_math_answer_01	Ah, yes. This question is a tricky one, isn’t it?\c\nDamage would be doubled if it’d used Work Up\ntwice, but we’re talking about Swords Dance.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_05_math_answer_02	Wow, that’s great! You answered this difficult\nquestion with ease, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_05_math_answer_03	Ah, yes. This question is a tricky one, isn’t it?\c\nJust because it boosts the Pokémon’s stat by four\nstages doesn’t mean damage is quadrupled.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_05_math_13	Each stage that a Pokémon’s Attack or Sp. Atk\nstat is raised increases its damage by 50 percent.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_05_math_14	So, being raised four stages would result in a four\ntimes 50 percent—or 200 percent—increase.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_05_math_15	The base damage of a move is 100 percent, so\nadding 200 percent to that gives us 300 percent.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_05_math_16	In other words, the next move the Pokémon uses\nwill deal triple damage.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_05_math_17	Type matchups, critical-hit damage, and other\nfactors all play into these calculations as well,\r\nso even a small boost must be taken seriously.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_05_math_18	By the way, if a stat simply “rose,” that means it\nhas gone up by one stage.\c\nIf it “rose sharply,” that’s two stages.\c\nAnd if it “rose drastically,” that’s three stages.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_05_math_19	Just so you know, the X Attack and X Sp. Atk\nitems, which can only be used in battle, can be\r\nused to sharply boost those respective stats.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_05_math_20	Oh, my. Is that the bell? I suppose that’s all for\nnow. What a shame...[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_05_math_21	Today’s lesson was a little difficult, so be sure to\nreview what you learned in order to stay “sharp”!\r\nI’ll see you all again next class.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_06.tbl
class_b_06_math_01	Hello, everyone. Let’s have a fun class today.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_06_math_02	Did you make sure to review last class’s material\nin order to stay “sharp”?[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_06_math_03	I know it was a little difficult with all that talk of\nmultiplication and percentages and the like.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_06_math_04	But today, we’ll be talking about percentages\nagain to learn about probability.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_06_math_05	That may sound like we’re going to have another\ndifficult class, but did you know that all of you\r\nalready deal with probability on a regular basis?[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_06_math_06	Pokémon moves generally have a property called\naccuracy, which determines the probability that\r\nthey will hit.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_06_math_07	The accuracy of Tackle is 100—or 100 percent.\nSo if you were to use Tackle 100 times, you\r\ncould expect it to hit all 100 times![VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_06_math_08	The move Hypnosis, which puts opponents to\nsleep, has an accuracy of 60—or 60 percent.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_06_math_09	That means you could expect it to hit 60 times\nin 100 uses. To put that another way—out of 100\r\nuses, you could expect it to miss 40 times![VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_06_math_10	Many of the truly powerful moves often tend to\nhave lower accuracy.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_06_math_11	So when you’re deciding whether to go slow and\nsteady with moves that are sure to hit, or hard\r\nand fast with stronger but less accurate moves...[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_06_math_12	you’re already studying probability![VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_06_math_13	Let me see here... Perhaps Surf and Hydro Pump\nwould be good examples for this discussion?[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_06_math_14	Surf has a power of 90. Its accuracy is 100,\nmeaning you can expect it to hit every time.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_06_math_15	Hydro Pump’s accuracy is only 80—but when it\nhits, its power is 110![VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_06_math_16	So, between Surf and Hydro Pump, which move\nwould you want to use yourselves?[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_06_select_01	I’d use Surf
class_b_06_select_02	I’d use Hydro Pump
class_b_06_select_03	It depends on the situation
class_b_06_math_answer_01	Oh my. I see it’s “slow and steady wins the race”\nfor you, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_06_math_answer_02	Oh my. I see you like the risky, adventurous side\nof things, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_06_math_answer_03	Oh my. I see you’re always considering various\npossibilities, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_06_math_17	I may have made it sound like there was a correct\nanswer here, but there’s not!\c\nYou’re free to use any moves you wish![VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_06_math_18	Factors like PP or number of targets hit may make\nsome moves more suited to certain situations.\c\nHowever, trading accuracy for power or vice\nversa is purely a matter of preference![VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_06_math_19	This Surf-versus-Hydro Pump debate has been\nongoing for quite some time.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_06_math_20	Personally, I’m more invested in debating the\nRock-type moves Rock Slide and Stone Edge.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_06_math_21	Let me tell you, I could get really worked up\ntalking about those moves, but—\c\nOh, my. There’s the bell. What a shame.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_06_math_22	Next class will be the last of our time together,\nso show up 100 percent ready to go![VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_07.tbl
class_b_07_math_01	Hello, everyone. I hope we can have fun once\nagain today for our last class together.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_07_math_02	Last time we learned about probability, using\nmove accuracy as an example.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_07_math_03	Probability is quite an interesting subject. Did\nyou know that, in a class with 40 students, there\r\nis a 90 percent chance that two of them will have\r\nthe same birthday?[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_07_math_04	This is true even despite the fact that there are\nover 300 days each year. Isn’t that remarkable?[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_07_math_05	But let’s move on to today’s topic before we\nget swept along with probability again.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_07_math_06	I’ve been teaching you all how to calculate\ndamage in this class using examples like type\r\nmatchups, critical hits, stat boosts, and the like.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_07_math_07	All of these variables are multiplied together to\ncalculate damage dealt to an opponent.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_07_math_08	However, did you know that there is an even\nsimpler way to increase the damage of your\r\nPokémon’s moves?[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_07_math_09	All you have to do is have your Pokémon use\na move it shares a type with![VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_07_math_10	If a Rock-type Pokémon uses the Rock-type move\nStone Edge, the move’s base power of 100 is\r\nmultiplied by 1.5 to become 150.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_07_math_11	Ground and Rock may seem like similar types,\nbut if a Ground-type Pokémon uses Stone Edge,\r\nthe move’s power will remain 100.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_07_math_12	Supereffective moves and critical hits also add\nmultipliers on to this little numerical increase,\r\nso it most certainly must not be taken lightly.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_07_math_13	Let me ask you a question to see if you\nunderstand what I’m talking about here.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_07_math_14	Say you have a move with a power of 100. If a\nPokémon that shares a type with this move\r\nuses it and hits an opponent that is weak to\r\nthat type, what happens to that move’s power?[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_07_select_01	Its power becomes 150
class_b_07_select_02	Its power becomes 200
class_b_07_select_03	Its power becomes 300
class_b_07_math_answer_01	Close! But a power of 150 would only take into\naccount the multiplier of 1.5 resulting from the\r\nPokémon sharing a type with the move.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_07_math_answer_02	Close! But a power of 200 would only take into\naccount the doubling effect of using a move\r\nthat is super effective against an opponent.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_07_math_answer_03	You did that calculation all in your head? Well\ndone, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_07_math_15	First, using a move that shares a type with its user\nmultiplies the move’s base power of 100 by 1.5,\r\nmaking the power 150![VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_07_math_16	The fact that the opponent is weak to the move’s\ntype then doubles that power from 150 to 300![VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_07_math_17	The original power of the move ends up being\ntripled! Isn’t that amazing?[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_07_math_18	What’s more, if a Pokémon Terastallizes and its\nTera Type matches one of its original types, then\r\nthe bonus it gets for using a move of that same\r\ntype increases from 1.5 to 2![VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_07_math_19	Of course, being able to use a lot of moves with\ndifferent types is great as well. That’s one way\r\nyou can surprise your opponent.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_07_math_20	In the end, your own innate characteristics are\nwhat will really let you shine the most.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_07_math_21	Bear in mind that this is true for both humans and\nPokémon.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_07_math_22	It sure would make me happy if you could take\nthose words to heart![VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_07_math_23	But I suppose I should really have shared this\nbasic advice right from our first lesson.\c\nMy apologies...[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_07_math_24	And just like that, class is over. The last of our\ntime together flew by in the blink of an eye.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_07_math_25	It was so much fun to be able to teach all you\neager students about numbers.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_07_math_26	Next class will be our fun final exam! Be sure to\nreview the material well in preparation.[VAR 0114(0025)]

class_c_01_history_01	Oho... I see we have some new students here with\nus today.[VAR 0114(002C)]
class_c_01_history_02	My name is Raifort. I will be the one to impart\nknowledge of the past to your little minds.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_01_history_03	History is a wonderful thing. Truly splendid.\c\nThe lives of our ancestors throughout history\nforged the path to the present in which we live![VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_01_history_04	Today, you shall learn about the most mysterious\nlocation in all of Paldea—the Great Crater.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_01_history_05	As you are all aware, a massive crater known as\nthe Great Crater of Paldea exists in the heart of\r\nour region.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_01_history_06	The area inside this crater is called Area Zero,\nand research of its geological strata and material\r\ncomposition has shown that the crater is in fact\r\nover one million years old.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_01_history_07	It was long believed that [VAR FF00(0006)]a certain something[VAR FF00(0000)]\nrested at the bottom of this mysterious crater.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_01_history_08	Aha. Perfect timing to make eye contact, young\n[VAR 0100(0000)]. Answer me this...[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_01_history_09	What exactly was believed to rest in the depths\nof the Great Crater—inside Area Zero?[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_01_select_01	Treasure
class_c_01_select_02	A Snorlax
class_c_01_select_03	A Pokémon Center
class_c_01_history_answer_01	Heh. That is correct! You are a surprisingly clever\none, aren’t you? I see you did your homework\r\nprior to coming to my class.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_01_history_answer_02	Incorrect! An adorable answer, to be sure, but\nwere you perhaps fooled by my use of “rest”?\r\nThe correct answer is treasure.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_01_history_answer_03	Incorrect! An interesting answer, to be sure, but\nthat would be quite the anachronistic artifact.\r\nThe correct answer is treasure.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_01_history_10	That’s right! Some believed that a treasure more\nvaluable than anything else in this world rested in\r\nthe depths of the Great Crater![VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_01_history_11	So much for dreams of treasure hunting, though,\nas a lab has been built in those very same depths.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_01_history_12	Oh, and before I forget—you would all do well\nto remember that the Great Crater and Area\r\nZero are both off-limits to all but those who\r\nhave official business there.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_01_history_13	Do not dare entertain the foolish notion of\ngallivanting off to Area Zero in search of riches.\c\nIt is no place for children dreaming of treasure\nand adventure![VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_01_history_14	Besides, if it were at all possible to investigate\nthe area, I would surely be the first to do so![VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_01_history_15	Oho, is that the time already? I must’ve gotten\nswept up in filling your minds with knowledge.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_01_history_16	This ends today’s lesson. We will unravel more of\nhistory’s enigmas together next time.[VAR 0114(0027)]

class_c_02_history_01	Greetings, my little students. Whatever you did\nyesterday, it is now a part of history.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_02_history_02	Today, we will continue to unravel the marvels\nthat history has presented to us.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_02_history_03	About two thousand years ago, this region came\nunder the rule of the Paldean Empire.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_02_history_04	Historical accounts describe the Paldean emperor\nas being quite the dictator.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_02_history_05	This emperor also zealously believed the legend\nof the treasure that rests deep within Area Zero.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_02_history_06	I must mention that the civilizations of our\nancestors were not as developed as ours is today.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_02_history_07	People back then were far more likely to believe\nin mysterious legends, magic, and beings beyond\r\nhuman comprehension.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_02_history_08	In an attempt to gain the power to stand against\nPaldea’s neighboring countries, the emperor\r\nsent people in droves to join the hunt for the\r\nfabled treasure of Area Zero.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_02_history_09	Aha. Perfect timing to make eye contact, young\n[VAR 0100(0000)]. Answer me this...[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_02_history_10	Approximately how many years ago was it that\nthe Paldean Empire began to rule this region?[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_02_select_01	About one thousand years ago
class_c_02_select_02	About two thousand years ago
class_c_02_select_03	About three thousand years ago
class_c_02_history_answer_01	Incorrect! You’re off by an entire millennium!\c\nWhy, one thousand years ago, the Paldean\nEmpire had already begun to collapse![VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_02_history_answer_02	Heh. That is correct!\c\nYou are a surprisingly clever one, aren’t you?\nI see you’re listening intently to my lecture.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_02_history_answer_03	Incorrect! You’re off by an entire millennium!\c\nWhy, three thousand years ago, the Paldean\nEmpire didn’t even exist yet![VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_02_history_11	The answer is about two thousand years ago.\nThat is when the Great Era of Exploration began.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_02_history_12	However, it is said that not a single adventurer\nsent out by the emperor ever reached the depths\r\nof Area Zero.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_02_history_13	Was it the punishing journey itself that barred\ntheir way? Or perhaps some unknown creature?[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_02_history_14	The resounding failure of this “Great” Era of\nExploration almost certainly heightened the air\r\nof mystery surrounding the crater.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_02_history_15	Oh, what I wouldn’t give to explore Area Zero in\nits untouched state at that time![VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_02_history_16	I suppose I can only hope for the swift invention\nof a time machine.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_02_history_17	Oho, is that the time already? I must’ve gotten\nswept up in filling your minds with knowledge.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_02_history_18	This ends today’s lesson. We will unravel more of\nhistory’s enigmas together next time.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_03.tbl
class_c_03_history_01	Greetings, my little students. Whatever you did\nyesterday, it is now a part of history.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_03_history_02	Today, we will continue to unravel the marvels\nthat history has presented to us.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_03_history_03	As you should remember from our last class,\nArea Zero’s Great Era of Exploration began\r\nabout two thousand years ago.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_03_history_04	This era lasted for approximately one thousand\nyears, but not a single soul was able to venture\r\nall the way to the deepest reaches of Area Zero.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_03_history_05	Having poured much of its human and financial\nresources into the exploration of Area Zero for\r\nso long, the Paldean Empire fell into decline.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_03_history_06	Two hundred years later—or eight hundred years\nago—the empire and its surrounding nations\r\nunited into one entity.\c\nThis was the formation of Paldea as we know it\ntoday.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_03_history_07	Ah yes, this very academy where you’re now\nfilling your young minds with knowledge was also\r\napparently established at that time.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_03_history_08	In fact, this school building—though certainly\nhaving undergone repairs through the years—\r\nis just as it was when it was built so long ago.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_03_history_09	This very structure is a piece of history! Ahh!\nThings of old are truly splendid![VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_03_history_10	I would certainly prefer it not to have the Poké\nBall portion, though—a relatively new addition.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_03_history_11	Aha. Perfect timing to make eye contact, young\n[VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_03_history_12	Let’s see if you’ve been listening to my lecture.\c\nTell me—approximately how many years ago\nwas this academy of ours established?[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_03_select_01	About six hundred years ago
class_c_03_select_02	About seven hundred years ago
class_c_03_select_03	About eight hundred years ago
class_c_03_history_answer_01	Incorrect! You are missing two hundred years of\nsplendid history![VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_03_history_answer_02	Incorrect! You are missing one hundred years of\nsplendid history![VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_03_history_answer_03	Correct! I see the look of concentration on your\nface was indeed just that.\c\nI hate nothing more than when a student only\npretends to listen.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_03_history_13	This academy was constructed exactly 805 years\nago, to be precise. In other words, your academy\r\nhere is 805 years old![VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_03_history_14	At the time, it offered state-of-the-art facilities\nand a uniquely innovative curriculum. As such,\r\npeople used to say...[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_03_history_15a	“Those seeking knowledge need look no further\nthan the oranges of Paldea.”\c\nThat’s right—they were referring to Naranja\nAcademy![VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_03_history_15b	“Those seeking knowledge need look no further\nthan the grapes of Paldea.”\c\nThat’s right—they were referring to Uva\nAcademy![VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_03_history_16	It is said that this proverb of sorts was even used\noutside of the Paldea region.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_03_history_17	Oho, is that the time already? I must’ve gotten\nswept up in filling your minds with knowledge.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_03_history_18	This ends today’s lesson. Our next class will be\nour midterm exam.\c\nBring the wonders of history to the forefront of\nyour minds in preparation.[VAR 0114(0027)]

class_c_05.tbl
class_c_05_history_01	Greetings, my little students. Whatever you did\nyesterday, it is now a part of history.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_05_history_02	I was hoping to continue unraveling the marvels\nthat history has presented to us today.\c\nHowever, I imagine your ability to concentrate\nhas been spectacularly derailed by my midterm.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_05_history_03	I suppose changing things up for fun and variety\nmay be a good idea every now and then.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_05_history_04	So allow me to tell you an old fairy tale that has\nbeen passed down in Paldea for generations.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_05_history_05	Once upon a time, there was a king who very\nmuch enjoyed collecting treasure.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_05_history_06	He was particularly fond of treasures from\nother countries.\c\nOne day, a merchant from the East heard rumors\nof this king and came to meet him.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_05_history_07	The merchant laid out four treasures in front of\nthe treasure-loving king.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_05_history_08	The four treasures were as follows: a vessel, a\nsword, a set of tablets, and a set of beads.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_05_history_09	Seeing such rarities before him, the king leaped\nfor joy.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_05_history_10	He showered the merchant with gold coins and\nclaimed all four of the treasures for himself.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_05_history_11	Aha. Perfect timing to make eye contact, young\n[VAR 0100(0000)]. Answer me this...[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_05_history_12	I said that one of the treasures was a “set of\ntablets.” What do you think these tablets were?[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_05_select_01	Wooden planks for writing on
class_c_05_select_02	Handheld electronic devices
class_c_05_select_03	Medicine that you chew
class_c_05_history_answer_01	Correct! Your daily pursuit of knowledge serves\nyou well.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_05_history_answer_02	Incorrect! Is that some kind of joke? Were you\nexpecting me to laugh at your assumption that\r\nelectronic tablets existed in the distant past?[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_05_history_answer_03	Incorrect! Is that some kind of joke? Were you\nexpecting me to laugh at the notion that\r\nchewable tablets would be considered treasure?[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_05_history_13	These particular tablets were wooden and used\nas a writing medium in the East in ancient times.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_05_history_14	As you may know, they fell out of popular use\nas paper become more universally available.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_05_history_15	For the king to consider these paper substitutes\ntreasures, they must have been of superb quality.\c\nThat, or perhaps they had some amazingly\nprofound teachings written on them.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_05_history_16	So, the king obtained these four treasures, and\non that very night...[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_05_history_17	it is said that a terrible disaster rained down upon\nhis castle, reducing it to rubble by dawn.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_05_history_18	Oho, is that the time already? I wasn’t done with\nmy story, but alas. So ends today’s lesson.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_05_history_19	If you are interested in how the story ends,\nyou may come see me outside class hours.[VAR 0114(0027)]

class_c_06_history_03	I trust that you all remember our lesson before\nthe midterm exam concerning the Great Crater\r\nof Paldea and its interior—Area Zero.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_06_history_04	This mysterious crater captured the imaginations\nof many—including the former Paldean emperor.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_06_history_05	Two hundred years ago, a group of explorers\nclaimed to have finally reached its depths.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_06_history_06	The name of the team that achieved this great\nfeat was the Area Zero Expedition.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_06_history_07	The team is said to have been made up of\nPaldea’s best and brightest.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_06_history_08	Skilled battlers, brilliant researchers—talented\nindividuals of all kinds.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_06_history_09	Among the list of team members was the name\nof a man who was an author and brilliant natural\r\nhistorian: [VAR FF00(0006)]Heath[VAR FF00(0000)].[VAR 0114(0027)]

class_c_06_history_11	Aha. Perfect timing to make eye contact, young\n[VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_06_history_12	Let’s see if you were paying attention.\c\nWhat was the name of the team that first made it\nto the deepest reaches of the Great Crater?[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_06_select_01	The Area Zero Adventurers
class_c_06_select_02	The Area Zero Expedition

class_c_06_history_answer_01	Incorrect! I see that even your little head has\nbecome full of dreams of adventure.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_06_history_answer_02	Correct! To pick up on and remember a term I\nsimply slipped into the flow of the lecture...\r\nYou really are quite the clever one.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_06_history_answer_03	Incorrect! Though I will admit that an expedition\nand a survey corps may take part in very\r\nsimilar activities![VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_06_history_13	The correct name for this team was the Area\nZero Expedition![VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_06_history_14	The record of their activities written by the\nexpedition member Heath can be found in\r\nbookstores and the like even today.[VAR 0114(0027)]

class_c_06_history_16	At the time, the entire region of Paldea was\nabsolutely buzzing about Area Zero.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_06_history_17a	The Scarlet Book was so popular that practically\neveryone had a copy.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_06_history_17b	The Violet Book was so popular that practically\neveryone had a copy.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_06_history_18	However, the book itself was full of fantastical\ndescriptions and illustrations of things that could\r\nnever be thought of as real.\c\nThe masses began to call Heath a liar.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_06_history_19	Even the truth of the expedition making it to the\nbottom of the crater was called into question.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_06_history_20a	The Scarlet Book was condemned to the shelves\nof used bookstores as just another book of wild\r\nparanormal stories.[VAR 0114(0027)]

class_c_07_history_02	Today is our last class, so I would like to unravel\nthe marvels that history has presented to us\r\none last time.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_07_history_03	In our last class, I taught you about the Area Zero\nExpedition of two hundred years ago, correct?[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_07_history_04	Alas, two hundred years is not that long ago.\nNot that long ago at all.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_07_history_05	How unfortunate that our history lessons must\nmarch so inexorably toward the future.[VAR 0114(0027)]

class_c_07_history_07b	Indeed. It may be difficult to understand the\nflow of events—how one thing leads to another—\r\nif we were to trace history in reverse.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_07_history_08	*sigh* I suppose I have no choice but to let the\nflow of time carry us toward the future.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_07_history_09	In this last class of ours, I shall fill your minds with\nthe history of the Terastal phenomenon.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_07_history_10	The technology behind Tera Orbs has its origins\nin Area Zero.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_07_history_11	Even after the Area Zero Expedition supposedly\nreached the crater’s deepest depths, others\r\ncontinued to explore that area...[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_07_history_12	And, around 140 years ago, Pokémon cloaked\nin a mysterious light were discovered there.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_07_history_13	As you may have already guessed, these were, in\nfact, Terastallized Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_07_history_14	However, when those who discovered these\nPokémon brought them out of Area Zero, the\r\nlight faded, and the Terastal phenomenon\r\nremained a mystery for quite some time.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_07_history_15	However, 10 years ago—ugh, that might as well\nbe present day—a certain someone you have\r\ndefinitely heard of unraveled this mystery.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_07_history_16	Aha. Perfect timing to make eye contact, young\n[VAR 0100(0000)]. Answer me this...[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_07_history_17	What is the name of the famous professor who\nunraveled the Terastal phenomenon mystery?[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_07_select_01	Professor Heath
class_c_07_select_02a	Professor Sada
class_c_07_select_02b	Professor Turo
class_c_07_select_03	Professor Clavell
class_c_07_history_answer_01	Incorrect! Heath is the one who wrote the record\nof the Area Zero Expedition’s activities. You must\r\nbe remembering our last class together.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_07_history_answer_02	Correct! To think that you—a new transfer to our\nacademy—could correctly answer this question...\r\nYou must be very diligent in your studies.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_07_history_answer_03	Incorrect! Or, no...perhaps you are correct, in a\nroundabout sort of way...[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_07_history_18a	Approximately 10 years ago, a professor\nnamed Sada unraveled the mystery of the\r\nTerastal phenomenon.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_07_history_18b	Approximately 10 years ago, a professor\nnamed Turo unraveled the mystery of the\r\nTerastal phenomenon.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_07_history_19a	She discovered that the shining crystals down in\nArea Zero—or rather, the energy they emit—is\r\nwhat causes Pokémon to Terastallize.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_07_history_19b	He discovered that the shining crystals down in\nArea Zero—or rather, the energy they emit—is\r\nwhat causes Pokémon to Terastallize.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_07_history_20	This led the professor to invent Tera Orb\ntechnology and to develop a practical use for it.\c\nThis technology was then shared with both the\nPokémon League and our academy.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_07_history_21	Rumor has it that Director Clavell was one of the\nresearchers on the professor’s team...[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_07_history_22	Alas. This story is much less exciting now that\nsomeone we all know appears in it.\c\nModern history truly is dull, isn’t it?[VAR 0114(0027)]

class_d_01_language_06	That’s right! My classes will teach you about\nvarious languages from different regions.[VAR 0114(0026)]
class_d_01_language_07	You may say “Good morning!” or “Hello!” as a\ngreeting, but people from elsewhere may say\r\n“Bonjour!” or “Salut!”[VAR 0114(0026)]

class_d_01_language_14	When you travel abroad, you should try to speak\nthe local language as much as you can—even if\r\nyou can’t speak it very well![VAR 0114(0026)]

class_d_02_language_12	The first step to smooth communication is to\ncompliment the person you’re talking to![VAR 0114(0026)]
class_d_02_language_13	After all, it’s not very likely that a compliment\nwould put someone in a bad mood![VAR 0114(0026)]

class_d_05_language_18	The same Pokémon can even communicate its\nfeelings in many different ways![VAR 0114(0026)]
class_d_05_language_19	Their voices change depending on their mood\nand physical condition.[VAR 0114(0026)]
class_d_05_language_20	Try listening more carefully to Pokémon—you\nmight gain a deeper understanding of them![VAR 0114(0026)]
class_d_05_language_21	That having been said, Pokémon are quite\nmysterious creatures![VAR 0114(0026)]
class_d_05_language_22	Some actually don’t communicate with words at\nall, but instead use things like electromagnetic\r\nor ultrasonic waves—some even use telepathy![VAR 0114(0026)]
class_d_05_language_23	And now, apropos of nothing, let me give you\nall one of my wise words of advice![VAR 0114(0026)]
class_d_05_language_24	If you poke at your Pokémon too many times\nwhile washing them during picnics, they’ll get\r\nmad at you like Pikachu just demonstrated![VAR 0114(0026)]
class_d_05_language_25	Well, adios! Mata ne! À la prochaine! See you\nlater, everyone![VAR 0114(0026)]

class_d_06_language_05	Vas-y—go for it, my assistant! Pika pi, Pikachu![VAR 0114(0026)]
class_d_06_poke_01	Pikachu!
class_d_06_language_06	As you may remember from our last class,\nthe same Pokémon’s cries may sound different\r\ndepending on what it wants to say![VAR 0114(0026)]
class_d_06_language_07	Aujourd’hui—today, that is—we will be learning\nmore about the language used by Pokémon![VAR 0114(0026)]
class_d_06_language_08	Je t’en prie—if you would be so kind, Pikachu![VAR 0114(0026)]
class_d_06_poke_02	Pikaaa...
class_d_06_language_09	Hmmm! That sounds a little bleak, doesn’t it? Its\nvoice seems a little lower pitched, too![VAR 0114(0026)]
class_d_06_language_10	What emotion do you suppose Pikachu was\ntrying to convey just now?[VAR 0114(0026)]
class_d_06_select_01	Happiness
class_d_06_select_02	Sadness
class_d_06_select_03	Surprise
class_d_06_select_04	Say it again, Pikachu!

class_d_06_language_14	When Pikachu says...[VAR 0114(0026)]
class_d_06_poke_03	Pikaaa...
class_d_06_language_15	It’s expressing sadness! Kind of makes you want\nto cry, doesn’t it?[VAR 0114(0026)]
class_d_06_language_16	That’s right—I had my little Pikachu cry as if it\nwas...crying! Haha! Funny joke, right?[VAR 0114(0026)]
class_d_06_language_17	Don’t you think it did a great job? Give Pikachu\na round of applause, everyone![VAR 0114(0026)]
class_d_06_popup_01	*clapping*
class_d_06_language_18	And now, apropos of nothing, let me give you\nall one of my wise words of advice![VAR 0114(0026)]
class_d_06_language_19	If you hear one of your Pokémon making sad\nnoises like this one, you should treat them with\r\neven more kindness than usual.[VAR 0114(0026)]
class_d_06_language_20	Well, you probably already knew that, though! A\npiece of cake for you all, I’m sure![VAR 0114(0026)]
class_d_06_language_21	Of course, this goes for your classmates and\nothers as well![VAR 0114(0026)]
class_d_06_language_22	Friends should support each other in times of\nsadness! I truly hope that you all can have smiles\r\non your faces all the time, my friends![VAR 0114(0026)]

class_d_07_language_16	As you live your lives, I’m sure you will all have\ntimes when you get mad or sad—maybe even\r\nmore than you would like![VAR 0114(0026)]
class_d_07_language_17	Everything has its ups and downs. Life is a\nveritable roller coaster![VAR 0114(0026)]

class_d_08_language_05	I’m sure you all did great! Bravo, my friends! You\ncan get your scores at the school’s front desk![VAR 0114(0026)]
class_e_01.tbl
class_e_01_battle_01	Osu! Say hello to your battle instructor—\nThe one! The only! The hot-blooded Dendra!\c\n“Osu” is a karate thing, by the way. Look it up![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_01_battle_02	My age? 25! My hobby? Working out!\nMy...type?! Well...[VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_01_battle_03	Strong and muscular Fighting types, of course![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_01_battle_04	That’s all for my introduction! As for my class,\nthis is where you all get to learn the nitty-gritty\r\nof Pokémon battling![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_01_battle_05	We’ll start with the basics so that no Trainer gets\nleft in the dust! Even if you’re new to this stuff,\r\nhave no fear![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_01_battle_06	Leave it to me and my muscles, and you’ll be\npros in no time.\c\nLet’s set our fighting spirits ablaze—together![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_01_battle_07	Pokémon have all kinds of attack moves at their\ndisposal, and each move has certain qualities\r\nthat you’ll want to remember![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_01_battle_08	I’m talking about the power, type, and [VAR FF00(0006)]category[VAR FF00(0000)]\nof these moves![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_01_battle_09	Higher power means more damage—especially if\nyour opponent is weak to that move’s type![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_01_battle_10	Heads up, new kid! Question coming your way!\c\nThere are two categories that attack moves can\nfall under. Know what they are?[VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_01_select_01	Moves of light and moves of darkness
class_e_01_select_02	Physical moves and special moves
class_e_01_select_03	Moves you love and moves you hate
class_e_01_battle_answer_01	That’s not only wrong—it’s totally out there!\c\nAre you OK, new kid?! Or are you just at that\nage where you’re really into fantasy stuff?[VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_01_battle_answer_02	Awesome! You’re just as sharp as I expected, new\nkid! Looks like you have a handle on the basics![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_01_battle_answer_03	That’s not only wrong—it’s kinda sad!\c\nAre you OK, new kid?! Or are you just at that\nage where you’re really into bittersweet stuff?[VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_01_battle_11	Anyway, attack moves are split into two\ncategories—[VAR FF00(0006)]physical[VAR FF00(0000)] and [VAR FF00(0006)]special[VAR FF00(0000)]![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_01_battle_12	Physical moves do more damage the higher the\nPokémon’s [VAR FF00(0006)]Attack[VAR FF00(0000)] stat is![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_01_battle_13	And special moves do more damage the higher\nthe Pokémon’s [VAR FF00(0006)]Sp. Atk[VAR FF00(0000)] stat is![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_01_battle_14	On the other side of things, Pokémon getting hit\nby these moves can take less damage by having\r\na high [VAR FF00(0006)]Defense[VAR FF00(0000)] or [VAR FF00(0006)]Sp. Def [VAR FF00(0000)]stat, respectively![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_01_battle_15	In conclusion![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_01_battle_16	Pokémon that are good with [VAR FF00(0006)]physical moves[VAR FF00(0000)]\nshould raise their [VAR FF00(0006)]Attack[VAR FF00(0000)] stat!\c\nAnd Pokémon that are good with [VAR FF00(0006)]special moves[VAR FF00(0000)]\nshould raise their [VAR FF00(0006)]Sp. Atk[VAR FF00(0000)] stat![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_01_battle_17	Trying to raise both of these stats equally will just\nmake it hard for the Pokémon to shine in battle![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_01_battle_18	Make your strong points stronger, I always say—\nthat goes for both people and Pokémon![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_01_battle_19	Aw, man! I was just about to suggest we do some\nhands-on practice to really drive the point home,\r\nbut I guess we’re out of time...[VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_01_battle_20	We’ll generally meet for my class here in the\nschoolyard—even for book learning!\c\nNothing like a little fresh air to make studying\nmore fun, am I right?[VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_01_battle_21	But class is over for now! Take care, you little\nrascals![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_02.tbl
class_e_02_battle_01	Another day, another round of battle study! Osu!\nLet’s get right to it![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_02_battle_02	Is everyone excited about the Treasure Hunt?![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_02_battle_03	It’s always a great adventure! You get to take on\nGyms, go to new places, and run all over the\r\nplace with your partner Pokémon![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_02_battle_04	And, while you’re running around out there,\nI’ll bet you’ll come across some big, shining\r\n[VAR FF00(0006)]crystals [VAR FF00(0000)]fairly often as well.[VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_02_battle_05	These crystals are actually collections of Terastal\nenergy that’s seeped up out of the ground![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_02_battle_06	You can check out these crystals to battle Tera\nPokémon with your friends or other Trainers in a\r\ngroup of four.[VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_02_battle_07	We call those battles...Tera Raid Battles![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_02_battle_08	The Tera Pokémon you’ll face off against in Tera\nRaid Battles are crazy tough![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_02_battle_09	They sometimes act differently than regular\nPokémon, so you’ll need to be on your guard![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_02_battle_10	Luckily, Trainers can also use a special action in\nTera Raid Battles. It’s called [VAR FF00(0006)]cheering[VAR FF00(0000)]![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_02_battle_11	And there are three different cheers you can use![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_02_battle_12	The first cheer is “[VAR FF00(0006)]Go all out![VAR FF00(0000)]” It boosts the\nAttack and Sp. Atk of all ally Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_02_battle_13	The second is “[VAR FF00(0006)]Hang tough![VAR FF00(0000)]” This one boosts\nthe Defense and Sp. Def of all ally Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_02_battle_14	And the third— Well, let’s see if you can guess![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_02_battle_15	This cheer restores HP for all ally Pokémon.\nWhat do you think it is?[VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_02_select_01	Heal up!
class_e_02_select_02	Wham-Bam Potion!
class_e_02_select_03	Explosive healing wave!
class_e_02_battle_answer_01	That’s right! Maybe I should make YOU the battle\nteacher, huh, new kid?![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_02_battle_answer_02	Wham-Bam Potion?! That sounds less like a cheer\nand more like a seriously heavy-handed medical\r\ntreatment or something![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_02_battle_answer_03	Explosive healing wave?! That’s a wild answer if\nI ever heard one! But I think I’d like to give that\r\nmove a whirl if it really existed![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_02_battle_16	The third and final cheer is “[VAR FF00(0006)]Heal up![VAR FF00(0000)]” It’s a real\npowerhouse, with the ability to both restore HP\r\nand cure status conditions![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_02_battle_17	You can cheer up to three times during a single\nTera Raid Battle.[VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_02_battle_18	Also, cheering uses up a turn in battle, so you\nwon’t be able to have your Pokémon use any of\r\ntheir moves when you cheer![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_02_battle_19	In conclusion![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_02_battle_20	Try everything at your disposal! If nothing seems\nto be working, try cheering on your allies![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_02_battle_21	Providing support for your team can sometimes\nopen up a new realm of possibilities![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_02_battle_22	Aw, man! I was just about to suggest we do some\nhands-on practice to really drive the point home,\r\nbut I guess we’re out of time...[VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_02_battle_23	Class is over for now! Take care, you little rascals![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_03.tbl
class_e_03_battle_01	Another day, another round of battle study! Osu!\nLet’s get right to it![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_03_battle_02	Last time, we learned about Tera Raid Battles!\nDid any of you have a chance to try them out?[VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_03_battle_03	Tera Pokémon are super strong! And the more\ndifficult ones will use an even tougher tactic that\r\nyou’ll need to deal with.[VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_03_battle_04	I’m talking about their [VAR FF00(0006)]Tera Shield[VAR FF00(0000)]![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_03_battle_05	What happens while a Pokémon has its\nTera Shield up, you ask?[VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_03_battle_06	Well, it’ll take WAAAY less damage, for one![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_03_battle_07	It has a big effect on morale, too![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_03_battle_08	When Trainers see that shield go up, they feel\ndoomed—like there’s no way to win the battle![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_03_battle_09	So, here’s a question for you![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_03_battle_10	If the Pokémon you’re battling puts up its Tera\nShield, what should you do?[VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_03_select_01	Close your eyes and give in
class_e_03_select_02	Call your parents
class_e_03_select_03	Terastallize and attack it
class_e_03_battle_answer_01	What?! Don’t just accept defeat! You should be\nable to find a way out of this predicament if you\r\nkeep on fighting![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_03_battle_answer_02	What?! Don’t call your family to tell them you’re\nabout to lose! You should be able to find a way\r\nout of this predicament if you keep on fighting![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_03_battle_answer_03	That’s right! You’re a regular Tera Raid Battle\nmaster, aren’t you, new kid?[VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_03_battle_11	Regular attacks don’t work so well against\nPokémon that have their Tera Shield up.[VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_03_battle_12	But having your Pokémon Terastallize is an\neffective method to overcome that issue!\c\nA Terastallized Pokémon will do more damage\nto shielded Pokémon—especially if it uses moves\r\nthat match its Tera Type![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_03_battle_13	Dealing enough damage to a Pokémon with its\nTera Shield up can destroy the shield and break\r\nthe Pokémon’s stance![VAR 0114(0024)]

class_e_04_battle_05	I saw you giving it everything you’ve got! I’m sure\nyou’ll all get perfect scores![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_04_battle_06	Well done, everyone. You can ask for your scores\nat the front desk![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_05.tbl
class_e_05_battle_01	Another day, another round of battle study! Osu!\nLet’s get right to it![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_05_battle_02	You all gave everything you had on the midterm\nexams. Well done![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_05_battle_03	We’ll resume our regular classes today, so keep\nup that energy for the second half of the term![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_05_battle_04	Have you all been using the R Button to send out\nyour Pokémon?[VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_05_battle_05	If you do, your Pokémon will run off in the\ndirection you’re facing.[VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_05_battle_06	It’s a super-useful tactic that lets your Pokémon\npick up faraway items for you. And that’s not all![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_05_battle_07	If there’s a wild Pokémon near where you sent\nyour Pokémon, they’ll start battling each other![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_05_battle_08	We call those battles...Auto Battles![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_05_battle_09	Just as the name implies, your Pokémon will\nact on its own during Auto Battles—meaning\r\nyou won’t have to give it any commands![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_05_battle_10	And if your Pokémon wins, it’ll get Exp. Points\njust like it would in a regular battle.[VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_05_battle_11	If you make good use of these battles, they can\nbe a really efficient way to train your party![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_05_battle_12	But you’ll want to remember that Pokémon won’t\nevolve or learn new moves right away if they level\r\nup from an Auto Battle.[VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_05_battle_13	Also, if a Pokémon LOSES an Auto Battle, it’ll\ncome back with just a small amount of HP left.\r\nMake sure to heal it up right away![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_05_battle_14	Whoops. I just about did the whole class as a\none-sided lecture. Does anyone have any\r\nquestions so far?[VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_05_select_01	How do I stop an Auto Battle?
class_e_05_select_02	Can I catch wild Pokémon in Auto Battles?
class_e_05_select_03	No questions here!
class_e_05_battle_answer_01	There’s no stopping an Auto Battle once it starts!\nYou’ll have to wait and see how it plays out!\c\nYou can call your Pokémon off before the battle\nstarts, though, if you press the ZR Button while\r\nyour Pokémon is still on its way to the opponent![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_05_battle_answer_02	If you let your Pokémon battle on its own, it’ll\nkeep going until its opponent is defeated!\c\nIf you want to catch a wild Pokémon, you’ll need\nto battle by issuing commands instead![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_05_battle_answer_03	Great! You’re all really good at this. I can’t wait\nto see where you go from here![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_05_battle_15	Even during Auto Battles, our Pokémon are out\nthere battling for us—their Trainers![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_05_battle_16	Keep an eye on them as much as possible, and\nif it looks like they’re going to lose, be sure to\r\nhave them retreat![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_05_battle_17	Also, this goes without saying, but Pokémon with\nlow HP are already worn out.[VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_05_battle_18	They probably won’t enjoy Auto Battles as much,\nso don’t work them too hard, OK?[VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_05_battle_19	In conclusion![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_05_battle_20	Auto Battles only work if a Trainer and their\nPokémon have a relationship of mutual trust![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_05_battle_21	Be smart with how you use Auto Battles so you\ndon’t lose the trust of your Pokémon![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_05_battle_22	Aw, man! I was just about to suggest we do some\nhands-on practice to really drive the point home,\r\nbut I guess we’ve run out of time, as usual...[VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_05_battle_23	Class is over for now! Take care, you little rascals![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_06.tbl
class_e_06_battle_01	Another day, another round of battle study! Osu!\nLet’s get right to it![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_06_battle_02	I hope you gave Auto Battles a shot like we\ntalked about last class![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_06_battle_03	Making good use of Auto Battles will let you train\nup a bunch of different Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_06_battle_04	It’s also an efficient way to gather the Pokémon\nmaterials you need to make TMs at TM Machines![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_06_battle_05	Speaking of which! Have you all been using the\nTM Machines?[VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_06_battle_06	I sure hope so, ’cause it’s pop quiz time![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_06_battle_07	To create TMs, you need Pokémon materials and\none other thing. Anyone remember what that is?[VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_06_select_01	LP
class_e_06_select_02	HP
class_e_06_select_03	Money
class_e_06_battle_answer_01	Looks like you’re already a TM Machine pro,\nnew kid![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_06_battle_answer_02	Whoa! Hold on there, new kid! Offering up HP to\ncreate TMs sounds like some kind of ritual or\r\nsomething! That’s not how it’s done![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_06_battle_answer_03	Close, new kid! Close! But don’t think that money\nmakes every little thing in the world go ’round![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_06_battle_08	The correct answer is League Points—or LP\nfor short![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_06_battle_09	You can give LP and Pokémon materials to a TM\nMachine to create TMs. But that’s not all!\c\nYou can also exchange Pokémon materials at a\nTM Machine to get LP![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_06_battle_10	I recently heard about some shady individuals\ngetting LP illegally using a technique called...\r\nhacking? Or something like that.[VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_06_battle_11	I don’t want any of you getting involved in bad\nstuff like that. Got it?![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_06_battle_12	Anyway, you can also add TMs that you want to\nmake to your watch list. This will let you keep an\r\neye on the materials you need to gather![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_06_battle_13	In conclusion![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_06_battle_14	In order to make TMs, you need Pokémon\nmaterials![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_06_battle_15	And if you want to get hold of lots of materials,\nyou’ll have to battle all kinds of Pokémon![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_06_battle_16	Aw, man! I was just about to suggest we do some\nhands-on practice to really drive the point home,\r\nbut I guess we’re never gonna have the time...[VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_06_battle_17	Class is over for now! Take care, you little rascals![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_07.tbl
class_e_07_battle_01	Osu! This is our last class, but don’t let those\nenergy levels drop before we wrap things up![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_07_battle_02	You’ve shown that you have more than enough\nknowledge to be superstrong battlers![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_07_battle_03	I don’t know that I have much left to teach you...[VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_07_battle_04	but we can always aim for ever-greater heights![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_07_battle_05	So today, I’m going to teach you about the rules\nof Link Battles![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_07_battle_06	When two Trainers participate in Link Battles\ntogether, they can engage in either Single Battles\r\nor Double Battles with each other![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_07_battle_07	And if you’re playing in a group of four, you can\nall battle each other in Multi Battles![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_07_battle_08	Now, when you’re out having battles during your\nindependent study, you can use whatever number\r\nof Pokémon you like—and they can be any level![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_07_battle_09	But, in Link Battles, there are special rules to\nkeep in mind.[VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_07_battle_10	Some of these special rules involve adjusting\nPokémon’s levels![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_07_battle_11	Now, the [VAR FF00(0006)]No Restrictions [VAR FF00(0000)]rule set lets all Pokémon\nstay at their current level.\c\nIt lets Trainers use multiple Pokémon of the same\nspecies and multiples of the same held item, too![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_07_battle_12	But if you choose to use [VAR FF00(0006)]Normal Rules[VAR FF00(0000)], all\nPokémon will be set to Lv. 50 for your battles—\r\nregardless of what level they actually are.[VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_07_battle_13	This even includes lower-level Pokémon. They’ll\nget a power boost to participate![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_07_battle_14	Normal Rules let you use multiples of the same\nPokémon species and of the same held items too.[VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_07_battle_15	The great part about this rule set is that it lets\nany of your Pokémon participate—all they have\r\nto do is learn some good moves![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_07_battle_16	Lastly, the rule set called [VAR FF00(0006)]Flat Rules[VAR FF00(0000)] mostly affects\nPokémon over Lv. 50. Such Pokémon will be set\r\nto Lv. 50 for the duration of the battle![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_07_battle_17	The Flat Rules rule set is the one often used for\nofficial tournaments.[VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_07_battle_18	This rule set does NOT allow Trainers to use\nmultiple Pokémon of the same species or\r\nmultiples of the same held item![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_07_battle_19	All right. Here’s a question for you![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_07_battle_20	Which rule set should you pick if you want to use\na lower-level Pokémon and keep its level low?[VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_07_select_01	Normal Rules
class_e_07_select_02	Flat Rules
class_e_07_battle_answer_01	Oooh, gotcha there! Normal Rules adjusts all\nPokémon to Lv. 50—even lower-level ones![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_07_battle_answer_02	That’s the one, new kid! Looks like you were\nlistening to the lesson![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_07_battle_21	If you’ve got some clever strategy that you need\nto use a Lv. 5 Pokémon for, your best bet is to\r\nchoose the Flat Rules rule set![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_07_battle_22	Of course, you can also choose No Restrictions if\nyou want to battle with any Pokémon you want—\r\nat any level and with any held item![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_07_battle_23	That’s a pretty good rule set for when you want\nto battle freely with friends.[VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_07_battle_24	In conclusion![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_07_battle_25	Normal Rules adjusts all Pokémon to Lv. 50!\c\nFlat Rules lets you use lower-level Pokémon at\ntheir actual levels![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_07_battle_26	I hope you’ll use these tips to have some exciting\nbattles with your friends![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_07_battle_27	Aw, man! I was just about to suggest we do some\nhands-on practice to really drive the point home,\r\nbut I guess we truly are out of time...[VAR 0114(0024)]

class_f_01_dragon_01	Greetings, I am Hassel. I will be teaching this art\nclass. It is a pleasure to meet you all![VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_01_dragon_02	Now, let me be candid for one moment.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_01_dragon_03	I imagine that many of you will forget all that\nyou learned in this class once you graduate![VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_01_dragon_04	After all, you don’t need even a basic\nunderstanding of artwork, much less a refined\r\nappreciation of beauty, for most exams or jobs.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_01_dragon_05	So, is my class a waste of time for you, then?[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_01_dragon_06	I think not! At least, I certainly hope it isn’t![VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_01_dragon_07	Think for a moment, all of you. What is beauty,\nanyway? What makes something beautiful?[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_01_select_01	Its shape and color
class_f_01_select_02	The eye of the beholder
class_f_01_select_03	I don’t know
class_f_01_dragon_answer_01	Interesting... Thank you, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_01_dragon_08	Oh, I don’t mean to suggest there’s a correct\nanswer to my query. The important thing is that\r\nyou all take time to think about it.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_01_dragon_09	Think about why we might find beauty in a flower\nblooming on the side of the road, for example.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_01_dragon_10	Question why the sky is a different shade of blue\nthan the ocean or why the leaves change color.\c\nPonder the windmills of Artazon and how they\nmove. Contemplate the chilling bite of the\r\nwaters of Cascarrafa.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_01_dragon_11	I’m sure you will find that every little detail of\nyour lives will seem more vivid, more impactful,\r\nif you just take a moment to stop and think.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_01_dragon_12	And I am certain that if you stop and truly\nappreciate the little beauties of this world...[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_01_dragon_13	it will help pull you through the days where your\nstudies have you exhausted or when work has\r\ndampened your spirits.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_01_dragon_14	Ah, do pardon me for waxing philosophical.\nYou don’t need to understand all of that now.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_01_dragon_15	To put it simply, it is true that one doesn’t need\nart to survive... But it certainly makes surviving\r\nmuch more enjoyable![VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_01_dragon_16	It is my hope that this class will add even a little\nbit of color to your lives.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_01_dragon_17	That’s all for today—next time, we’ll try a more\nhands-on approach to appreciating beauty![VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_02.tbl
class_f_02_dragon_01	Hello, class! It is I, Hassel, yet again.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_02_dragon_02	In our previous class, we discussed what beauty\nis...which might have been a little boring for you.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_02_dragon_03	So today, I thought I would mix things up a little\nto pique your interest in art.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_02_dragon_04	Allow me to introduce our special guest![VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_02_poke_01	Gib gibble.
class_f_02_dragon_05	This is Professor Gible, the assistant lecturer\nfor today.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_02_dragon_06	Now then, Professor Gible. If you would be so\nkind as to Terastallize for us...[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_02_poke_02	Glaaam!
class_f_02_dragon_07	As some of you may already know, a Pokémon\ncan Terastallize if you use a Tera Orb.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_02_dragon_08	Normally, Professor Gible would be of the\nDragon type...[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_02_dragon_09	But by Terastallizing, it’s succeeded in changing\nits type![VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_02_dragon_10	So, class...what type do these lovely, glistening\nflowers above Professor Gible’s head represent?[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_02_select_01	The Grass type
class_f_02_select_02	The Fire type
class_f_02_select_03	The Water type
class_f_02_dragon_answer_01	[VAR BD06(0000)]Excellent, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nFull marks\r\nfor you![VAR 0114(0012)]

class_f_02_dragon_11	These beautiful flowers blooming above\nProfessor Gible’s head show that it has now\r\nbecome a Grass type.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_02_dragon_12	The shape of the [VAR FF00(0006)]Tera Jewel[VAR FF00(0000)] above a Pokémon’s\nhead depends on the Pokémon’s Tera Type.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_02_dragon_13	To summarize! If an opponent’s Pokémon\nTerastallizes during battle...[VAR 0114(0012)]

class_f_02_dragon_16	It is my sincere hope that today’s lecture will\nhelp you all achieve beautiful victories.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_02_dragon_17	The Terastal phenomenon is indeed a fascinating\nand deep subject to discuss.[VAR 0114(0012)]

class_f_03_dragon_01	Hello, class! It is I, Hassel, yet again.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_03_dragon_02	I’ve been told that my previous lecture about\nthe Terastal phenomenon was very well received.\r\nThank you all for your kind words![VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_03_dragon_03	In fact, Ms. Dendra specifically requested that\nI impart even more battle knowledge to\r\nmy students...[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_03_dragon_04	So, I have decided that today we will take\nanother look at how a Pokémon can Terastallize![VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_03_poke_01	Gib gibble.
class_f_03_dragon_05	And of course, here is Professor Gible to help us.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_03_dragon_06	Now then, Professor Gible. If you would be so\nkind as to Terastallize for us...[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_03_poke_02	Glaaam!
class_f_03_dragon_07	Now, what do we have here? Last class we saw\nGrass-type Terastallizing, but this time we have\r\nsomething of a different shape.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_03_dragon_08	Observe, a Tera Jewel resembling a snowflake!\nIts dendritic shape is stunning to behold.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_03_dragon_09	It’s a little chilly standing so close to it...[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_03_dragon_10	So, class... What Tera Type do you imagine this\njewel might represent?[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_03_select_01	The Water type
class_f_03_select_02	The Ice type
class_f_03_select_03	The Ghost type
class_f_03_dragon_answer_01	[VAR BD06(0000)]Very close, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nThis is\r\nwater...\r\nbut\r\nin\r\na\r\ndifferent state![VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_03_dragon_answer_02	[VAR BD06(0000)]Excellent, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nFull marks\r\nfor you![VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_03_dragon_answer_03	[VAR BD06(0000)]Ah, not exactly, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nThough\r\nI\r\nsuppose\r\nthat\r\nis\r\nchilling\r\nin\r\nits\r\nown\r\nway, too![VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_03_dragon_11	The reason there’s a snowflake shining above\nProfessor Gible’s head is simple—it is now\r\nan Ice type![VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_03_dragon_12	And because Professor Gible is currently the\nIce type...[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_03_dragon_13	Ice-type moves would not be very effective\nagainst it. Keep in mind, usually they would\r\ndeal quadruple damage to Gible![VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_03_dragon_14	Now, here’s some trivia about snowflakes:\nwhile snowflakes come in many different shapes\r\nand sizes, most are classified as hexagons![VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_03_dragon_15	Just think of it... Snowflakes fall from the sky,\ntaking similar shapes without anyone saying\r\nthey must.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_03_dragon_16	Do you not feel the great mystery of nature?\nThe beautiful enigma we live in?![VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_03_dragon_17	*cough*\c\nAh, this is a bit of a tangent, but Mr. Jacq’s\nglasses are also hexagonal, aren’t they.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_03_dragon_18	I almost forgot to mention that you can change\na Pokémon’s Tera Type at the [VAR FF00(0006)]Treasure Eatery[VAR FF00(0000)]\r\nlocated in Medali.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_03_dragon_19	Though I must say the cook there is a little...\nprickly—you’ll need to get on her good side if\r\nyou want her help.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_03_dragon_20	Now, come prepared for next class, because it is\ntime for your midterm examination!\c\nThank you for today, Professor Gible.[VAR 0114(0012)]

class_f_05.tbl
class_f_05_dragon_01	Hello, class! It is I, Hassel, yet again.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_05_dragon_02	I’m pleased to say that everybody did very well\non the midterm exams.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_05_dragon_03	As a reward for all of your hard work, we have\na special guest visiting us today![VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_05_dragon_04	Now then, Brassie, please come in![VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_05_kusa_01	Greetings![VAR 0114(002C)]
class_f_05_kusa_02	I am Brassius. I am an artist, and I focus\nexclusively on Grass-type Pokémon for my work.[VAR 0114(0017)]
class_f_05_dragon_05	Brassius here mainly creates three-dimensional\npieces, such as statues and the like.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_05_dragon_06	One of his major works is the installation titled\nSurrendering Sunflora, found in Artazon.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_05_dragon_07	Many of you who’ve challenged the Artazon Gym\nare no doubt familiar with these sculptures.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_05_kusa_03	Yes...I do recognize some faces among your\nstudents.[VAR 0114(0017)]
class_f_05_kusa_04	I hope you all understand how fortunate you are\nto be able to attend Hass’s classes.[VAR 0114(0017)]
class_f_05_kusa_05	Ol’ Hass is the man who saved me when I had\nlost all hope and given up on myself.[VAR 0114(0017)]
class_f_05_kusa_06	But he never gave up on me. I do not exaggerate\nwhen I say that he is my mentor in life![VAR 0114(0017)]
class_f_05_kusa_07	It is precisely thanks to Hass that I was able to\nestablish my current art style.[VAR 0114(0017)]
class_f_05_dragon_08	Ah, dear Brassie![VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_05_dragon_09	I’ve nothing against reminiscing about old times,\nbut today, I hope you will guide this class in a\r\nway only you can![VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_05_kusa_08	Of course![VAR 0114(0017)]
class_f_05_kusa_09	Let’s see... Ah, why don’t we discuss what Hass\nmentioned—Surrendering Sunflora?[VAR 0114(0017)]
class_f_05_kusa_10	Can anyone here tell what my mood was when I\ncrafted its detached expression?[VAR 0114(0017)]
class_f_05_select_01	A happy mood
class_f_05_select_02	A sad mood
class_f_05_select_03	An angry mood
class_f_05_kusa_11	No, no, no... Completely and utterly wrong![VAR 0114(0017)]
class_f_05_kusa_12	When I made that sculpture, I had surrendered\nall hope. I was prepared to give up everything.[VAR 0114(0017)]
class_f_05_kusa_13	I had resolved to give up my life as an artist if\nthat piece did not receive proper recognition.[VAR 0114(0017)]
class_f_05_dragon_10	Hence the name Surrendering Sunflora?[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_05_kusa_14	That’s exactly it, Hass![VAR 0114(0017)]
class_f_05_kusa_15	When I started out as an artist, I experienced\nmany hardships. I even became deathly ill and\r\nfell into a slump that drove me to desperation.[VAR 0114(0017)]
class_f_05_kusa_16	I began worrying only about what would sell.\nI was concerned only with fame and fortune...[VAR 0114(0017)]
class_f_05_kusa_17	But all of my pieces during this time had no\ndepth. They were all shallow trash![VAR 0114(0017)]
class_f_05_kusa_18	It was then that I met Hass. He helped me realize\nhow petty I was being. I’ll spare you the details...\r\nbut in the end I was able to leave all that behind![VAR 0114(0017)]
class_f_05_kusa_19	And that is also when I crafted the Sunflora![VAR 0114(0017)]
class_f_05_dragon_11	Remarkable! Even I did not know the full story\nuntil now![VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_05_kusa_20	This kind of thing is hard to tell someone,\nespecially when they are so close to you.[VAR 0114(0017)]
class_f_05_kusa_21	Now, I don’t doubt that you adolescents will\noften find your heads crowded with worries.[VAR 0114(0017)]
class_f_05_kusa_22	My advice to you is simple. Be honest with\nyourself, and do whatever your heart desires.\r\n...So long as you don’t cause trouble, that is.[VAR 0114(0017)]
class_f_05_kusa_23	That is all from me.[VAR 0114(0017)]
class_f_05_kusa_24	I must admit I am beginning to feel a bit\nembarrassed, so I bid you farewell, Hass!\r\nAnd farewell to your pupils as well![VAR 0114(0017)]
class_f_05_dragon_12	Oh Brassie, I can’t believe it... Such a wonderful...\nclass... Thank...[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_05_dragon_13	THANGYU SO MUBCH![VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_05_dragon_14	BWUUUH huh huh huh huh!\nHUUUH huh hoi hoi hoi...[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_06.tbl
class_f_06_dragon_01	Hello, class! It is I, Hassel, yet again.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_06_dragon_02	First, allow me to apologize for losing my\ncomposure during our last class...[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_06_dragon_03	I was so touched by Brassius’s story that I simply\ncouldn’t contain my emotions. I’m sorry for\r\nmaking such a scene.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_06_dragon_04	I certainly got a very stern talking-to from\nMs. Tyme after that class, yes...[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_06_dragon_05	Anyway, let us shift gears and dive into the\nmaterial for today’s class![VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_06_dragon_06	Now, have any of you heard of the Ten Sights\nof Paldea?[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_06_dragon_07	As the name would imply, they are ten sights in\nPaldea that are considered particularly beautiful.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_06_dragon_08	Among them, I would say that the[VAR FF00(0006)] Grand Olive[VAR FF00(0000)]\n[VAR FF00(0006)]Orchard[VAR FF00(0000)] is likely the most accessible.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_06_dragon_09	You can see field after field of olive trees from\nthe hill on the way to Cortondo.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_06_dragon_10	Two waterfalls are also counted among these\nten sights—[VAR FF00(0006)]Fury Falls[VAR FF00(0000)] and [VAR FF00(0006)]Casseroya Falls[VAR FF00(0000)].[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_06_dragon_11	Then there’s the peak of Glaseado Mountain,\nknown as [VAR FF00(0006)]Paldea’s Highest Peak[VAR FF00(0000)].[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_06_dragon_12	There’s another cliff on Glaseado Mountain that’s\nnamed after its rather unique shape.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_06_dragon_13	So, let me ask you, my students![VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_06_dragon_14	What is the name of the three-pronged cliff on\nGlaseado Mountain? No need to grasp at straws![VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_06_select_01	Glaseado’s Grasp
class_f_06_select_02	Glaseado’s Reach
class_f_06_select_03	Glaseado’s Run
class_f_06_dragon_answer_01	[VAR BD06(0000)]Exactly! It looks like a hand taking hold of\nsomething, doesn’t it, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_06_dragon_answer_02	A very good guess! I’d think something reaching\nwould stretch out farther, though.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_06_dragon_answer_03	A unique take! But that sort of name would\nusually apply to a slope, don’t you think?[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_06_dragon_15	The three-pronged cliff on Glaseado Mountain\nis in fact known as [VAR FF00(0006)]Glaseado’s Grasp[VAR FF00(0000)].[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_06_dragon_16	Though its shape is far too stubby to be that\nof a human hand. I imagine someone thought it\r\nlooked like a Pokémon hand grabbing something.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_06_dragon_17	There’s also the mountains in Area Three of the\nEast Province, where you can get a good look at\r\nLevincia. It’s particularly gorgeous at night![VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_06_dragon_18	In fact, the view is so brilliant, it is known as the\n[VAR FF00(0006)]Million Volt Skyline[VAR FF00(0000)].[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_06_dragon_19	I hear it’s quite a hotspot for dates—and\ndeservedly so for having such a romantic view![VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_06_dragon_20	I imagine it’s...what do the kids say these days...\na very, ahem, “fleek selfie spot”?[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_06_dragon_21	Of course, you may feel that not all ten sights live\nup to their grandiose names. How often do we\r\nvisit some tourist spot only to be disappointed?[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_06_dragon_22	Not to say that you shouldn’t visit them, only\nthat you should keep your hopes in check.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_06_dragon_23	The important thing is to go yourself and see\nthem with your own two eyes.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_06_dragon_24	And sometimes, a disappointing experience can\nbe worthwhile in its own way. Take a chance![VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_06_dragon_25	Well, that’s it for today, class. Thank you for\nyour attention![VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_07.tbl
class_f_07_dragon_01	Hello, class! It is I, Hassel, yet again.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_07_dragon_02	My, my, how time flies, as they say![VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_07_dragon_03	Indeed, our time together has certainly flown by.\nIt’s hard to believe that this is our last class.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_07_dragon_04	Now, our topics for today may feel somewhat\nunrelated to art.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_07_dragon_05	But there is absolutely no set definition as to\nwhat art should be![VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_07_dragon_06	Therefore, let us carry on with the discussion and\nsee where it takes us![VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_07_dragon_07	There are two things I wish to focus on today—\nRibbons...and marks![VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_07_dragon_08	Both Ribbons and marks are special honors that\ncapture a Pokémon’s qualities.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_07_dragon_09	There will be times when your Pokémon gives\nmaximum effort or has a noteworthy experience.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_07_dragon_10	In recognition of its feats and accomplishments,\nit can be given a Ribbon.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_07_dragon_11	To give an example, if you manage to become\nincredibly close to a Pokémon, it may be granted\r\nthe Best Friends Ribbon.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_07_dragon_12	Incidentally, there is a person in Cascarrafa who\ncan give your Pokémon a Best Friends Ribbon.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_07_dragon_13	Marks, on the other hand, are mostly found on\nwild Pokémon when you meet them for the\r\nfirst time.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_07_dragon_14	They can symbolize the character of a Pokémon,\nsuch as with the Rowdy Mark or the Vigor Mark.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_07_dragon_15	It’s completely up to luck whether you’ll run into\na Pokémon with these marks![VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_07_dragon_16	So if you’re able to catch a Pokémon with a\nmark, rejoice at your outstanding fortune![VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_07_dragon_17	Does anyone know what special thing you can do\nwith Pokémon that have Ribbons or marks?[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_07_select_01	You can exchange Ribbons!
class_f_07_select_02	You can show them off!
class_f_07_select_03	You can change their title!
class_f_07_dragon_answer_01	Ah, unfortunately, you can’t transfer Ribbons or\nmarks from one Pokémon to another, nor can you\r\ntrade them with other people’s Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_07_dragon_answer_02	Well, yes, indeed you can show them off, but\nsurely that’s not the extent of your interest, is it?[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_07_dragon_answer_03	[VAR BD06(0000)]Wonderful, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Your\nknowledge\r\nis\r\nimpressive.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_07_dragon_18	The correct answer is that Pokémon with Ribbons\nor marks can be given titles.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_07_dragon_19	What’s more, they can be sent into battle\ndisplaying a title of your choosing![VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_07_dragon_20	For example, you could send out a Gible with\na Best Friends Ribbon by declaring...\r\n“Go! Gible the Great Friend!”[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_07_dragon_21	And while I know I just said that marks are\ngenerally found already on Pokémon when you\r\nmeet them for the first time...[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_07_dragon_22	it seems that more recently, Pokémon can be\nawarded certain marks based on their efforts.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_07_dragon_23	These are marks such as the Gourmand Mark,\nthe Itemfinder Mark, the Partner Mark, and so on.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_07_dragon_24	Perhaps it might be fun to try to work out how to\nget each mark using its name as a clue?[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_07_dragon_25	Well, that just about wraps up our last class![VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_07_dragon_26	Next is the final exam. Please review our material\nclosely so that you pass on your first try![VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_08.tbl
class_f_08_dragon_01	I do hope you’re all ready, because it is time for\nyour final exam! Focus and do your best![VAR 0114(0012)]

class_f_08_dragon_06	And it is my sincere wish that all of you go on to\neven greater, more prosperous futures.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_08_dragon_07	And that’s that! Good work, everyone! You can\nreceive your results from the front desk.[VAR 0114(0012)]

class_g_01_home_01	I see we have some energetic young ones in our\nclass this time around.[VAR 0114(002C)]
class_g_01_home_02	You may call me Mr. Saguaro.\c\nYour time here with me will be spent obtaining\nknowledge and skills indispensable for daily life.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_01_home_03	Many of you have left the care of your parents to\nlive here on your own in the academy dormitory.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_01_home_04	I pray that the knowledge I impart to you will\nimprove the quality of your lives and the\r\nnecessities thereof—food, clothing, and shelter.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_01_home_05	Of those three categories, I assume the most\npressing and interesting for you all is food.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_01_home_06	When you eat sandwiches on your picnics, the HP\nof your party Pokémon will be restored.\c\nYou will also gain something called [VAR FF00(0006)]Meal Powers[VAR FF00(0000)],\nwhich can provide all manner of benefits.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_01_home_07	For example, these powers can make Pokémon\neasier to catch or increase the Exp. Points that\r\nyour Pokémon receive.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_01_home_08	I think you will also find that the breadth of these\neffects can be expanded by crafting sandwiches\r\nof superb flavor.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_01_home_09	What’s more, there is a certain something that is\nparticularly important if we wish to receive Meal\r\nPowers with even more helpful effects.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_01_home_10	Let me see... M[VAR 1100(00FF,0305)]asteriss [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nTell me—what must you keep in mind to receive\neven more helpful Meal Powers?[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_01_select_01	My choice of fillings and condiments
class_g_01_select_02	How fast I can prepare the food
class_g_01_select_03	I have to remember to put my heart into it!
class_g_01_home_answer_01	[VAR BD06(0000)]Perfectly correct, M[VAR 1100(00FF,0305)]asteriss\n[VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nPerhaps you were already aware of this fact from\nhaving helped your family with cooking at home?[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_01_home_answer_02	That is...incorrect. I pray that you all put more\nemphasis on doing things well when cooking\r\nrather than simply rushing to finish quickly.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_01_home_answer_03	Ha! That is an interesting take. Though not\nexactly what I was looking for, I suppose you are\r\ncorrect, in a sense.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_01_home_11	Your choice of ingredients—including both fillings\nand condiments—is an important factor in gaining\r\neven more helpful Meal Powers.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_01_home_12	For example, using sweet ingredients in your\nsandwiches may help you gain Egg Power.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_01_home_13	Including numerous bitter ingredients, on the\nother hand, can gain you Item Drop Power.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_01_home_14	Learning to aim for specific effects when crafting\nsandwiches will almost certainly make your\r\nculinary endeavors more enjoyable.\c\nPlease be aware, however, that you can also\nreceive Meal Powers by eating at restaurants.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_01_home_15	I must say that I would feel the utmost joy if you\nall learned much here in my class and came to\r\nbetter understand home economics.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_01_home_16	Our time together has come to an end for today.\nI bid you all farewell.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_02.tbl
class_g_02_home_01	Put away your phones. It is time to begin class.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_02_home_02	In our last class, I believe we talked about the\neffects you can get from food on your picnics.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_02_home_03	You can receive Meal Powers and even restore\nHP for all the Pokémon in your party. It is a truly\r\nconvenient means of healing your Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_02_home_04	Unfortunately, as I’m sure you are aware, it is not\nsuited for use in battles—when you cannot make\r\nfood—or when you wish to restore HP quickly.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_02_home_05	In times such as those, you should make use of\nhealing items—such as [VAR FF00(0006)]Potions[VAR FF00(0000)], which you can\r\npurchase from Poké Marts or the school store.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_02_home_06	Healing items are immediately effective and can\nbe used anytime that you can open your Bag.\r\nThey are, however, consumed after one use.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_02_home_07	Potions restore 20 HP, Super Potions restore\n60 HP, and Hyper Potions restore 120 HP.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_02_home_08	The pricier the item, the more HP it will restore.\nKeep in mind how much money you have when\r\nyou are stocking up on these items.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_02_home_09	However, unforeseen happenings are an\ninextricable part of traveling from place to place.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_02_home_10	Imagine, if you will, the following scenario: you\nfind yourself with injured Pokémon, but you have\r\nno Potions, you are out of sandwich ingredients,\r\nand there are no Pokémon Centers nearby.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_02_home_11	Tell me, M[VAR 1100(00FF,0305)]asteriss [VAR 0100(0000)]...\c\nWhat should you search for when in a perilous\nsituation with no way to heal your Pokémon?[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_02_select_01	A place with water
class_g_02_select_02	A teacher
class_g_02_select_03	Items on the ground
class_g_02_home_answer_01	Would you hope to use the water to prepare a\nbracing meal perhaps?\c\nAs I mentioned, you have no ingredients, so even\nwith water, you would not be able to make food.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_02_home_answer_02	Ah, yes. Of course, if a teacher were nearby, they\ncould likely be of assistance.\c\nHowever, you must not assume that a grown up\nwill always be nearby to rush to your aid.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_02_home_answer_03	[VAR BD06(0000)]Perfectly correct, M[VAR 1100(00FF,0305)]asteriss\n[VAR 0100(0000)]!\r\nI see\r\nyou\r\nare\r\nwell-learned\r\nin\r\nsurvival techniques.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_02_home_12	If you see something shiny on the ground, it is\nactually an item that has been dropped there!\c\nYou may be able to find a restorative item, such\nas an Oran Berry or a Potion, in this way.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_02_home_13	You can use the [VAR FF00(0006)]R Button[VAR FF00(0000)] to send out your\nPokémon to pick up such items as well.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_02_home_14	And then there are Berries, of course.\c\nBerries, by the way, aren’t like items from shops—\nif you let your Pokémon hold one, it will decide\r\non its own when to eat the Berry during battle.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_02_home_15	Letting your Pokémon decide this timing for itself\ncan be quite interesting![VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_02_home_16	At any rate, if you find yourself in need of\nhealing, I suggest that you look around for\r\nshining items on the ground.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_02_home_17	If you can’t find such items, there are other\nmethods you may employ for healing your—\c\nAh, but I see the bell demands that topic wait.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_02_home_18	Our time together has come to an end for today.\nI bid you all farewell.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_03.tbl
class_g_03_home_01	Put away your phones. It is time to begin class.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_03_home_02	In my last class, I taught about HP restoration.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_03_home_03	However, after class, I was asked by several of\nyou about [VAR FF00(0006)]Power Points[VAR FF00(0000)], commonly known as [VAR FF00(0006)]PP[VAR FF00(0000)].[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_03_home_04	When a Pokémon loses all of its HP, it faints and\ncan no longer battle![VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_03_home_05	What, then, happens to a Pokémon when it loses\nall of its PP?[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_03_select_01	It can’t use moves
class_g_03_select_02	It won’t listen to its Trainer
class_g_03_select_03	All of its stats get lowered
class_g_03_home_answer_01	[VAR BD06(0000)]Perfectly correct, M[VAR 1100(00FF,0305)]asteriss\n[VAR 0100(0000)]!\r\nPerhaps\r\nyou\r\nknow\r\nthis\r\nfrom\r\nfirsthand experience?[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_03_home_answer_02	That would certainly be a dangerous situation,\nbut that is not the correct answer.\c\nWhether a Pokémon listens to its Trainer depends\non the number of Gym Badges the Trainer has.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_03_home_answer_03	That would certainly be a dangerous situation,\nbut that is not the correct answer.\c\nThat is not the sort of power we are talking\nabout when we talk of Power Points.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_03_home_06	When a Pokémon runs out of PP, it can no longer\nuse its moves.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_03_home_07	However, each move has its own store of PP, so\nyou can mitigate PP loss by using a variety of\r\nmoves rather than just one move repeatedly.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_03_home_08	If a Pokémon loses all PP for all of its moves, it\nwill only be able to use Struggle—an action that\r\nalso damages the Pokémon that uses it.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_03_home_09	In order to avoid this predicament, PP can be\nrestored at Pokémon Centers along with HP.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_03_home_10	Items such as Ethers and Max Ethers can also be\nused to restore PP. Be careful not to confuse\r\nPotions with Ethers in the heat of battle![VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_03_home_11	However, Ethers are not sold at shops, so you\nshould use them judiciously if you find them.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_03_home_12	The stronger the move, the lower its maximum PP.\c\nDo not waste uses of these moves unless you wish\nto quickly run out of PP. It is important to find\r\nbalance in a Pokémon’s set of moves.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_03_home_13	As you can see, HP isn’t the only thing you must\nkeep an eye on while adventuring with Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_03_home_14	I hope that you will all take care to ensure that\nyour partner Pokémon can perform at their best\r\nas you each engage in the Treasure Hunt.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_03_home_15	Our time together has come to an end for today.\nOur next meeting will be an examination day.\r\nBe sure to review well in preparation.[VAR 0114(0029)]

class_g_05_home_01	Put away your phones. It is time to begin class.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_05_home_02	Though some of you had to retake the midterm\nexam multiple times, I am glad to say that the\r\nmajority of the class passed without issue.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_05_home_03	I feel honored to see that the knowledge and\nskills indispensable for daily life have taken root\r\nin all of you.[VAR 0114(0029)]

class_g_05_home_05	Let us now turn our attention to the topic of the\nday, which was inspired by a question I received\r\non the subject of Meal Powers.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_05_home_06	The student who asked this question is a young\nman who enjoys the culinary arts.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_05_home_07	He tells me that he regularly researches culinary\ntechniques on his own and pays careful attention\r\nto the ingredients he uses.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_05_home_08	He also spends day and night studying all aspects\nof the culinary arts.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_05_home_09	Yet despite this, he is baffled by his inability to\nincrease the effectiveness of his Meal Powers.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_05_home_10	[VAR BD06(0000)]So tell me, M[VAR 1100(00FF,0305)]asteriss [VAR 0100(0000)],\nsince\r\nyou\r\ndid\r\nquite\r\nwell\r\non\r\nyour\r\nmidterm\r\nexam...[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_05_home_11	What should Ar—ahem, this young man—do to\nincrease the effectiveness of his Meal Powers?[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_05_select_01	He should make food more often
class_g_05_select_02	He should make food with other people
class_g_05_select_03	Ar...ven?
class_g_05_home_answer_01	The culinary arts are not so easily grasped.\nSimply engaging in them more often will not\r\nnecessarily reward you with success.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_05_home_answer_02	Perfectly correct. I see that you are\nknowledgeable about the culinary arts.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_05_home_answer_03	Ahem... I cannot disclose the identity of this\ncertain male student who enjoys the culinary arts.\r\nIt may very well be Arven, but it may not be![VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_05_home_12	To increase the effectiveness of Meal Powers,\nyour sandwiches must be filled with many\r\ndifferent ingredients.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_05_home_13	For a single person, this may prove difficult. But\nif you prepare a sandwich with others, you will\r\nbe able to handle a larger serving of bread.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_05_home_14	With a larger base to start with, it becomes quite\nsimple to add more ingredients to your sandwich.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_05_home_15	Which, in turn, makes it possible to receive Meal\nPowers of increased effectiveness.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_05_home_16	This applies more broadly as well. When dealing\nwith a difficult issue, working with others to solve\r\nthat issue may be the best course of action.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_05_home_17	I am sure that Arven will likewise work with\nfriends to craft his sandwiches in the future.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_05_home_18	Ahem... The identity of the male student is a\nmatter of privacy, so I would ask that you do not\r\npry too deeply.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_05_home_19	Our time together has come to an end for today.\nI bid you all farewell.[VAR 0114(0029)]

class_g_06_home_01	Put away your phones. It is time to begin class.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_06_home_02	While you’re out performing fieldwork with one\nof your Pokémon walking alongside you...[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_06_home_03	have you ever noticed changes in its coloration?[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_06_home_04	Now I don’t mean that it suddenly becomes a\nShiny Pokémon or any nonsense like that.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_06_home_05	I am speaking of it becoming filthy![VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_06_home_06	Pokémon battle! They get hurt by moves used\nagainst them![VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_06_home_07	They get battered by wind and rain! They get\ncovered in sand and mud![VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_06_home_08	They get, in a word, filthy![VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_06_home_09	I have seen many a Trainer walking about with\ntheir adorable little Pokémon without addressing\r\nthis issue. It is deplorable.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_06_home_10	Let me ask this question of someone who I am\nsure would not tolerate such shameful conduct.\r\nAh yes, M[VAR 1100(00FF,0305)]asteriss [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_06_home_11	What should you do if your Pokémon is dirty?[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_06_select_01	Clean it up
class_g_06_select_02	Pat it on the head
class_g_06_select_03	Nothing
class_g_06_home_answer_01	Perfectly correct! I knew I could count on you to\nprovide me with such an answer.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_06_home_answer_02	While patting your Pokémon on the head to\nexpress appreciation for its hard work would\r\nmake for an adorable moment, that would not\r\nclean it of its filth![VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_06_home_answer_03	I suppose, in time, filth accumulated from rain\nand mud may well fall of its own accord...but I\r\nnever expected such an answer from you.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_06_home_12	When your Pokémon are dirty, clean them!\nThis is, of course, simply common sense.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_06_home_13	While you are having a picnic, you can approach\nthe Pokémon on your team and perform a\r\nvariety of actions.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_06_home_14	One such action is putting them through what I\nlike to call the “Pokémon Wash”... In other words,\r\nyou are able to clean them up![VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_06_home_15	You start by getting your sponge lathered up with\nsoapy bubbles as you gently and carefully scrub\r\nyour Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_06_home_16	Once your Pokémon is nice and covered in\nsoapy bubbles...[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_06_home_17	the bubbles will encapsulate the filth, then you\nsimply wash it away with a spray of water![VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_06_home_18	This will get your Pokémon clean and shining\nbright as a Tera Jewel![VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_06_home_19	It is certainly quite a bit of work, but this will\nalso restore HP and cure status conditions.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_06_home_20	However, some Pokémon may have parts of their\nbodies that they don’t want scrubbed or that\r\nthey would rather not get wet.\c\nBe sure to keep this in mind when cleaning your\nPokémon.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_06_home_21	Now, the most important point that I must\nmention is that some Pokémon LIKE to be dirty.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_06_home_22	Though I will contradict myself by saying this,\nplease do remember that cleaning your Pokémon\r\nis not always the kind thing to do.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_06_home_23	Our time together has come to an end for today.\nI bid you all farewell.[VAR 0114(0029)]

class_g_07_home_02	Home economics is the study of life’s necessities,\nbut looking back on our time together, I realize\r\nthat I focused almost entirely on food.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_07_home_03	I hope it is not too late to shift to a discussion of\nclothing—another necessity—in our last class.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_07_home_04	As I’m sure you are aware, our academy has an\nair of freedom about it.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_07_home_05	We provide uniforms for each season to\naccommodate the diverse climate of Paldea.\c\nHowever, students are free to wear whichever\nstyle they wish whenever they please.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_07_home_06	You should all have received four sets of tops\nand bottoms—one each for spring, summer, fall,\r\nand winter—when the academy accepted you.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_07_home_07	If, by chance, you were not aware of this, you\nmay wish to peruse your wardrobe.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_07_home_08	As long as you wear our school uniform, the rest\nof your ensemble need not be school-issued.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_07_home_09	This includes your bag or your hat, if you choose\nto wear one. You are even free to style your hair\r\nhowever you wish.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_07_home_10	Mr. Salvatore’s hairstyle, for example, would\nalmost certainly have been against school rules\r\nwhen I was a boy.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_07_home_11	That reminds me...[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_07_home_12	There is one more thing you all like to decorate,\nwhich—I must say—I find quite charming.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_07_select_01	Our classroom desks?
class_g_07_select_02	Our dorm rooms?

common_0170.tbl
common_0170_rival_01	Way to go! For a second, I thought you were\nboth goners![VAR 0114(0004)]
common_0170_rival_18	Whoa! What’s wrong?![VAR 0114(0004)]
common_0170_rival_02	Maybe it used up all its power?\c\nWhat is this Pokémon, anyway? It kinda looks\nlike a Cyclizar, but I’ve never seen one quite\r\nlike this before...[VAR 0114(0004)]
common_0170_rival_03	And now it looks so different from a minute ago.\nYou think it’s OK?[VAR 0114(0004)]
common_0170_select_01	Hard to say
common_0170_select_02	I don’t know
common_0170_rival_04	[VAR BD06(0000)]You can’t tell either, huh,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0004)]
common_0170_rival_05	Well, all that aside, I’m seriously glad to have\nyou back up here in one piece![VAR 0114(0004)]
common_0170_rival_06	Let’s exchange numbers so we can get in touch if\nwe somehow get separated again![VAR 0114(0004)]
common_0170_rival_15	And here—this’ll let you teach your Pokémon a\nmove to help it battle stronger opponents![VAR 0114(0004)]
common_0170_rival_16	Think before you use it, though! TMs can only be\nused once.[VAR 0114(0004)]
common_0170_rival_07	You know...that battle down there was really\nsomething.[VAR 0114(0004)]
common_0170_rival_08	You and this fella looked perfectly in sync\nfacing down that Houndoom![VAR 0114(0004)]
common_0170_rival_09	What?! You didn’t even tell it what to do?[VAR 0114(0004)]
common_0170_rival_10	I guess it’s not like you’re this Pokémon’s\nTrainer yet, huh...[VAR 0114(0004)]
common_0170_rival_19	Oh good! Looks like it perked up a little![VAR 0114(0004)]
common_0170_rival_11	Do you think this fella was the one making that\nmysterious cry we heard before?[VAR 0114(0004)]
common_0170_legend_01	Giaos...
common_0170_rival_12	Oh man, oh man, oh man! The more I look at this\nPokémon, the more mysterious it seems![VAR 0114(0004)]
common_0170_rival_13	If you do become its Trainer, you gotta let me\nbattle against it![VAR 0114(0004)]
common_0170_rival_14	You’ve both been through enough for a minute!\nI think we better take a breather.\c\nLet’s just get to the lighthouse—that’ll be a good\nspot to relax.[VAR 0114(0004)]
common_0170_rival_stopper	Oye! That’s not how you get to the lighthouse![VAR 0114(0004)]

common_0185_friend_01	What’re you doing out here?![VAR 0114(002C)]
common_0185_friend_02	I’m not talking to you two. You can shove off.[VAR 0114(002C)]

common_0185_friend_03b	Doesn’t matter who my dad is![VAR 0114(0006)]
common_0185_friend_04	The real issue here is what in the world this\nPokémon is doing out here!\c\nAnd what is with this form it’s in?![VAR 0114(0006)]
common_0185_select_01	I met it at the bottom of this cliff...
common_0185_select_02	It saved me from a tight spot...
common_0185_rival_03	[VAR BD06(0000)]See, we heard this strange cry, and we tried to\ninvestigate, but [VAR 0100(0000)] fell\r\noff\r\na cliff...[VAR 0114(0004)]
common_0185_rival_04	That Pokémon saved h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer, but it seems like it\nwore itself out in the process. It got kinda...\r\nslumpy afterward.[VAR 0114(0004)]
common_0185_rival_05	But you shoulda seen it before! It looked totally\ndifferent—it was unbelievably strong![VAR 0114(0004)]
common_0185_friend_05	Well, yeah. As it should be. But it can’t fight\nwhile it’s like this.[VAR 0114(0006)]
common_0185_friend_06	The form [VAR 0101(0001)] takes in battle... That’s its\ntrue form.[VAR 0114(0006)]
common_0185_rival_06	[VAR 0101(0001)]? Is that this Pokémon’s name?\nHow’d you know it?[VAR 0114(0004)]
common_0185_legend_01	Agiagias!
common_0185_friend_16	You can’t go in the lab. It’s locked.[VAR 0114(0006)]
common_0185_friend_11	I don’t remember ever seeing you around. But\ngiven the uniform...you go to the academy too,\r\ndo you?[VAR 0114(0006)]
common_0185_friend_15	[VAR 0101(0001)] isn’t the sort of Pokémon that any\nold Trainer can hope to command. It’s special.[VAR 0114(0006)]
common_0185_rival_16	Special how? What sort of Pokémon is it?[VAR 0114(0004)]
common_0185_friend_12	You think you’re up to ordering [VAR 0101(0001)]\naround? Then how ’bout I test your worthiness?[VAR 0114(0006)]
common_0185_friend_17a	Heh! Well, look at you—quite the little go-getter![VAR 0114(0006)]
common_0185_friend_17b	I’m saying I want to test you. You can’t just leave\nme hanging here![VAR 0114(0006)]
common_0185_friend_18	I’ve been feeling all out of sorts, so I’m gonna\nuse this battle to blast these doldrums away![VAR 0114(0006)]
common_0185_rival_14	Wow, [VAR 0100(0000)]! That was awesome![VAR 0114(0004)]
common_0185_friend_13	I guess I wasn’t ever going to stand a chance\nusing some Pokémon I’d only just caught...[VAR 0114(0006)]
common_0185_rival_15	[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 0100(0000)]... Were you going\neasy\r\non\r\nhim?\r\nYou\r\ncould\r\nhave\r\nwon that.[VAR 0114(0004)]
common_0185_friend_14	Yeah, you’re in some serious trouble if you can’t\neven beat someone like me.\c\nI’d be worried about my future, if I were you.[VAR 0114(0006)]
common_0185_friend_07	But if you really think you can take [VAR 0101(0001)]\noff my hands for me...you’ll need this.[VAR 0114(0006)]
common_0185_friend_08	It’s the Poké Ball that brute’s been kept in.[VAR 0114(0006)]
common_0185_friend_09	[~ 32]
common_0185_rival_13	So why’d YOU have it?[VAR 0114(0004)]
common_0185_friend_10	Anyway, that thing’s your problem now, not mine.\nGood luck.[VAR 0114(0006)]
common_0185_rival_07	What? Oye! Can you not hear me or something?[VAR 0114(0004)]
common_0185_rival_08	Fine, be that way! But you better actually show\nup for school![VAR 0114(0004)]
common_0185_rival_09	What a weirdo...[VAR 0114(0004)]
common_0185_rival_10	That Arven guy definitely knows more than he’s\nletting on.[VAR 0114(0004)]
common_0185_rival_11	Next time, he and I are battling! I’m gonna wring\nsome answers outta him![VAR 0114(0004)]

common_0190_select_01	I’m looking forward to it!
common_0190_select_02	But all that schoolwork...
common_0190_rival_05a	Right? I can’t wait to get back. We’re gonna get\nto learn so much...and battle so, so, SO much![VAR 0114(0004)]
common_0190_rival_05b	Don’t think of it as schoolwork—think of it as\ntons of chances to learn about Pokémon battling![VAR 0114(0004)]
common_0190_rival_01	Isn’t it awesome what you can see from up here?[VAR 0114(0004)]

common_0210_pokecen_02	I’m here to keep everyone’s Pokémon healthy.
common_0210_pokecen_03	And this to my right is the Technical Machine\nMachine—TM Machine for short!
common_0210_pokecen_04	It’s your ticket to making TMs, which you can use\nto teach moves to your Pokémon.
common_0210_pokecen_05	You’ll need to pay in [VAR FF00(0006)]LP[VAR FF00(0000)] and supply the machine\nwith [VAR FF00(0006)]materials[VAR FF00(0000)] that Pokémon drop.

common_0210_rival_06	Remember: “Had a rough adventure?\nGet to the Pokémon Center!”\c\nSometimes you have to know this sort of stuff for\nquizzes at school.[VAR 0114(0004)]
common_0210_rival_08	But mnemonics help out!

common_0210_rival_09	That way, you can have the Pokémon that’s\nwalking with you go pick up items lying around\r\nor go battle on its own or other stuff like that![VAR 0114(0004)]
common_0210_rival_07	Now, time to go. Once we leave Los Platos, we’ll\nhit the best-known spot in the South Province’s\r\nArea One: the massive hill on the way to school!\c\nYou’ll usually find Trainers there who are just\nitching to battle. Good luck![VAR 0114(0004)]

common_2010_friend_08	I’m gonna enjoy every last day till graduation\nwith my buds here—and Mabosstiff, ’course![VAR 0114(0006)]

common_2010_head_teacher_13	And let us not forget the other good news!\nOur academy has a new Champion![VAR 0114(000A)]
common_2010_head_teacher_14	Though we sadly cannot make your valiant\ndeeds in the Great Crater known to the public,\r\nyour new Champion Rank, at least, should be\r\ncelebrated throughout the whole school![VAR 0114(000A)]
common_2010_rival_03	Oooh! I know how we should celebrate! We\nshould hold a Pokémon battle contest![VAR 0114(0004)]
common_2010_friend_10	Seriously? Could we not?[VAR 0114(0006)]
common_2010_botan_03	Classic Nemona.[VAR 0114(0008)]
common_2010_head_teacher_15	A Pokémon battle contest, you say...[VAR 0114(000A)]
common_2010_head_teacher_16	While your own vested interests in such a venture\nare more than apparent, Miss Nemona, I think\r\nit’s a fine idea![VAR 0114(000A)]
common_2010_head_teacher_17	But please understand that a large-scale event\nwill be quite beyond us. We’ve many other\r\nschool activities to keep an eye on, after all...[VAR 0114(000A)]
common_2010_top_01	Pardon my intrusion. I couldn’t help but overhear.[VAR 0114(002C)]
common_2010_top_02	The Pokémon League will, of course, happily\nlend a hand in organizing this contest.[VAR 0114(0011)]
common_2010_rival_04	La Primera?![VAR 0114(0004)]
common_2010_head_teacher_18	Well, well! A most kind offer, Chairwoman Geeta.[VAR 0114(000A)]
common_2010_top_03	I do everything in my power to nurture young,\nup-and-coming talent.[VAR 0114(0011)]
common_2010_top_04	Though that’s not to say only the youth have\npromise when it comes to Pokémon battles.[VAR 0114(0011)]
common_2010_top_05	A former Gym Leader... The developer of the\nPokédex app... This academy clearly counts many\r\nskilled Trainers of Pokémon among its staff.[VAR 0114(0011)]
common_2010_top_06	As such, my suggestion is as follows...[VAR 0114(0011)]
common_2010_top_07	Students AND staff should compete for the title\nof strongest Trainer at the academy![VAR 0114(0011)]
common_2010_rival_05	Whoaaa! We’d get to battle the TEACHERS!\nYou’d compete too, right, Primera?![VAR 0114(0004)]
common_2010_friend_11	Is that even allowed? The chairwoman’s not part\nof the academy, right?[VAR 0114(0006)]
common_2010_botan_04	Aaactually, I think she’s the chairwoman of the\nschool board as well as of the Pokémon League...[VAR 0114(0008)]
common_2010_friend_12	Wait, for real? I mean, I knew she was on another\nlevel, but...wow.[VAR 0114(0006)]
common_2010_top_08	Thank you for the invitation, Champion Nemona.\c\nI would gladly take up your kind offer to compete\nalongside you all, but...[VAR 0114(0011)]
common_2010_top_09	I’m afraid my schedule is already packed tight\nwith work that I simply must attend to.[VAR 0114(0011)]
common_2010_rival_09	Awww! Can’t you free up some time somehow?[VAR 0114(0004)]
common_2010_top_10	[VAR BD06(0000)]Well... I suppose I might be able to participate if\nChampion [VAR 0100(0000)] would agree\r\nto\r\nlend\r\nme\r\na\r\nhand\r\nwith\r\nmy work...?[VAR 0114(0011)]
common_2010_select_03	I’d be happy to help!
common_2010_select_04	Where should I start?
common_2010_top_11	[VAR BD06(0000)]Excellent answer. Much obliged, Champion\n[VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0011)]
common_2010_top_12	To get straight to it, I would like you to go out\nand inspect Paldea’s various Gyms in my stead.[VAR 0114(0011)]
common_2010_top_13	Are they fulfilling their duties as beacons of\nstrength and inspiration for all those aiming\r\nto achieve Champion Rank?\c\nOr has their brilliance started to fade?[VAR 0114(0011)]
common_2010_top_14	To find this out, I ask that you bring your full\nmight as Champion to bear against each of the\r\nGym Leaders and test their prowess in battle.[VAR 0114(0011)]
common_2010_top_15	They are all Trainers of exceptional talent,\nhandpicked by me personally.\c\nI do not expect you’ll find any cracks in their\narmor, but...well. Consider it a formality.[VAR 0114(0011)]
common_2010_top_16	This will also provide the perfect stage for your\nfirst appearance as a new Champion.[VAR 0114(0011)]
common_2010_top_17	Since all the Gym Leaders will still be expecting\nme to carry out the inspection, I imagine they’ll\r\nhave mustered their full strength.\c\nI daresay they might be more of a challenge than\nwhen you faced them before.[VAR 0114(0011)]
common_2010_rival_06	You get to have all-out battles with the Gym\nLeaders?! Man, I’m jealous...[VAR 0114(0004)]
common_2010_top_18	Now then, on to another crucial matter.\c\nI’d like to discuss with Penny here how to patch\nthe weaknesses in our League Point system.[VAR 0114(0011)]
common_2010_botan_05	Um. But...there’s a bunch of anime I’ve missed\nthat I was just...gonna...binge...[VAR 0114(0008)]
common_2010_top_19	Thank you in advance for your willing and\neager cooperation.[VAR 0114(0011)]
common_2010_botan_06	Gah—I mean...I’ll d-do it. I’ll help. Let me help.[VAR 0114(0008)]
common_2010_top_20	Excellent. We’ll leave you all to it, then. Come\nnow, Penny.[VAR 0114(0011)]
common_2010_rival_07	This is awesome, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nShow this inspection thing who’s boss so that\nLa Primera can join our tournament, OK?\c\nAnd enjoy taking another swing at the Gym\ngauntlet while you’re at it![VAR 0114(0004)]
common_2010_rival_08	I’ll take care of filling out the forms and other\nadministrative stuff so the ball gets rolling on the\r\ntournament in the meantime![VAR 0114(0004)]
common_2010_head_teacher_19	I say, it’s wonderful to see you all showing such\ninitiative. You each have a critical role to play.\c\nPenny assisting the League, our new Champion\ninspecting Gyms, Nemona arranging the event...\r\nGive it your best, everyone![VAR 0114(000A)]
common_2010_friend_13	... ... ...[VAR 0114(0006)]

common_2070_rival_09	Oh yeah—that’s what we decided to officially\nname the tournament! It’s a good name, right?\r\nFitting, memorable?[VAR 0114(0004)]
common_2070_rival_10	But then Arven went and said we should call it\nthe “School Battle Brawl”...[VAR 0114(0004)]
common_2070_rival_11	And then even Director Clavell got into calling it\nthat, so now I’m just like...agh![VAR 0114(0004)]
common_2070_rival_03	[VAR BD06(0000)]Anyway, how you feelin’, [VAR 0100(0000)]?\nIn the\r\nmindset\r\nto do\r\nsome winning?[VAR 0114(0004)]

common_2070_rival_07	But I’ll seize the chance to do some objective\nresearch into what makes YOU so good![VAR 0114(0004)]
common_2070_rival_08	Anyway, let’s get going. I’ll meet you at the\nfront desk in the entrance hall! No stalling![VAR 0114(0004)]
common_2080.tbl
common_2080_rival_01	There you are, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0004)]
common_2080_rival_02	You’ve gotta go through the application process\nwith a staffer before you can actually participate\r\nin the tournament![VAR 0114(0004)]
common_2080_rival_03	Ready for that explanation now, mister![VAR 0114(0004)]
common_2080_staff_01	All right. The rules of the Academy Ace\nTournament are as follows:\c\nAny student or faculty member of the academy\nmay enter. Your opponents will be random, and\r\nonly winners will advance to the next round!
common_2080_staff_02	Opponents will be matched by lottery, and the\nlottery is run by the people in charge.
common_2080_staff_03	That means you’ll have no idea who you’ll be\nfacing until you meet them on the battle court!
common_2080_staff_04	Winners, as I said, will get to advance to the\nnext round.
common_2080_staff_05	But lose once, and you’re knocked out—no more\nbattles for you after that.
common_2080_staff_06	The last Trainer standing—the only person to win\nall their matches—will be deemed the best of all,\r\nthe academy’s ace!
common_2080_rival_04	Thanks very much![VAR 0114(0004)]
common_2080_rival_05	We hashed out the tournament rules with help\nfrom Director Clavell.[VAR 0114(0004)]
common_2080_rival_06	Based on the number of entrants so far, you’d\nprobably have to win four times to take it all![VAR 0114(0004)]
common_2080_rival_07	Don’t forget you might go up against the faculty,\ntoo. They’re tough stuff...so good luck and go be\r\neven tougher![VAR 0114(0004)]
common_2080_rival_08	The only person allowed to beat you is me![VAR 0114(0004)]

kizuna_battle_b_home_01	Ms. Dendra tells me she is here for intensive\ntraining in sandwich making.[VAR 0114(0029)]
kizuna_battle_b_04	Aww. Well, no use hiding it now...[VAR 0114(0024)]
kizuna_battle_b_home_02	Oh dear. I’m terribly sorry. Were you keeping this\na secret?[VAR 0114(0029)]
kizuna_battle_b_05	Well, I mean, not really...but it just doesn’t look\nvery cool to openly admit I’m here for “intensive\r\ntraining.” Y’know?[VAR 0114(0024)]
kizuna_battle_b_home_03	Understood. I will be more careful in the future.[VAR 0114(0029)]
kizuna_battle_b_06	Well, new kid, now that you know what I’m\nup to...[VAR 0114(0024)]
kizuna_battle_b_07	I guess you’ll just have to help me out with my\ntraining here![VAR 0114(0024)]
kizuna_battle_b_08	Try this sandwich! It’s the result of my training\nso far.[VAR 0114(0024)]
kizuna_battle_b_system_02	Ms. Dendra’s sandwich was soggy and hard to\neat. And, once again, the taste left much to be\r\ndesired...
kizuna_battle_b_09	That was my meat lover’s prosciutto, bacon, and\nchorizo sandwich! How was it?[VAR 0114(0024)]
kizuna_battle_b_select_03	It was, uh, a little meat heavy...
kizuna_battle_b_select_04	It could have used some more veggies...
kizuna_battle_b_10	What?! You mean there was a problem with my\nchoice of filling?[VAR 0114(0024)]
kizuna_battle_b_11	I guess focusing on muscle-building ingredients\nreally did a number on the flavor, huh...[VAR 0114(0024)]
kizuna_battle_b_home_04	Ms. Dendra, I believe a simple addition of butter\nwould have done wonders for your sandwich.[VAR 0114(0029)]
kizuna_battle_b_home_05	Butter helps to protect the bread from getting\nsoggy due to the moisture of the ingredients.\r\nIt can also work to enhance the sandwich’s flavor.[VAR 0114(0029)]
kizuna_battle_b_12	Butter! That makes sense! Thank you for teaching\nme that tip, Mr. Saguaro![VAR 0114(0024)]
kizuna_battle_b_13	But why didn’t you tell me that while I was\nmaking the sandwich?[VAR 0114(0024)]
kizuna_battle_b_home_06	Ah...well, you see...when I saw you, I had not\nrealized you had begun your, ahem, food prep.\c\nI thought you were simply trying to destroy\nmy classroom.[VAR 0114(0029)]
kizuna_battle_b_14	... ... ...[VAR 0114(0024)]
kizuna_battle_b_15	Well, anyway![VAR 0114(0024)]
kizuna_battle_b_16	New kid! Thanks to you and Mr. Saguaro here,\nI may finally be getting the hang of this![VAR 0114(0024)]
kizuna_battle_b_17	Thanks for your advice![VAR 0114(0024)]
kizuna_battle_b_system_01	You became even closer with Ms. Dendra!
kizuna_battle_c.tbl
kizuna_battle_c_health_01	No way. No way! NO WAY![VAR 0114(0028)]
kizuna_battle_c_01	C’mon, Miriam! Just try it![VAR 0114(0024)]
kizuna_battle_c_select_01	Ms. Dendra!
kizuna_battle_c_select_02	What’s wrong?
kizuna_battle_c_02	Oh! Great timing, new kid![VAR 0114(0024)]
kizuna_battle_c_03	Nurse Miriam here won’t try the sandwich I made![VAR 0114(0024)]
kizuna_battle_c_health_02	Well, DUH! I don’t want to get a stomachache![VAR 0114(0028)]
kizuna_battle_c_04	You won’t! Probably![VAR 0114(0024)]
kizuna_battle_c_health_03	Uh, I still remember that “sandwich” you made\nme with meat filling and meat for bread.\r\nThat one really messed me up bad.[VAR 0114(0028)]
kizuna_battle_c_05	I hadn’t trained in the art of sandwich making yet\nback then! I was young and thoughtless and—[VAR 0114(0024)]
kizuna_battle_c_health_04	“Young and thoughtless”? It was LAST MONTH![VAR 0114(0028)]
kizuna_battle_c_06	Sooo, as you can see, I’m not getting anywhere\ntrying to persuade her.[VAR 0114(0024)]
kizuna_battle_c_07	Even after I went through that intensive sandwich-\nmaking training! It kinda makes me sad...[VAR 0114(0024)]
kizuna_battle_c_health_05	She went through intensive sandwich-making\ntraining?[VAR 0114(0028)]
kizuna_battle_c_select_03	She worked really hard at it!
kizuna_battle_c_select_04	You should try her sandwich
kizuna_battle_c_health_06	Ugh...[VAR 0114(0028)]
kizuna_battle_c_health_07	I guess I have no choice if you’ve got one of our\ncute little students on your side.[VAR 0114(0028)]
kizuna_battle_c_health_08	So, fine. I’ll try your sandwich. Let’s see it.[VAR 0114(0028)]
kizuna_battle_c_08	Yesss! I knew you’d come around. Here it is...[VAR 0114(0024)]
kizuna_battle_c_health_09	*munch munch munch*[VAR 0114(0028)]
kizuna_battle_c_health_10	It’s a little strongly flavored, but...I guess it’s\nnot bad?[VAR 0114(0028)]
kizuna_battle_c_09	Woo-hoo! My training paid off![VAR 0114(0024)]
kizuna_battle_c_10	I’m so glad my sandwich pleases the great\nNurse Miriam! I look up to you, you know![VAR 0114(0024)]
kizuna_battle_c_system_01	You feel trusted by Ms. Dendra!
kizuna_battle_c_11	Thank you for trying it! And thanks to you too,\nnew kid![VAR 0114(0024)]
kizuna_battle_c_health_11	Aaand she’s run off again. That was weird...[VAR 0114(0028)]
kizuna_battle_c_health_12	But that’s just how Ms. Dendra is, I guess. She’s\nalways coming into the nurse’s office with some\r\ninjury or another, too.[VAR 0114(0028)]
kizuna_battle_d.tbl
kizuna_battle_d_01	Osu, new kid! You here to do a little shopping?[VAR 0114(0024)]
kizuna_battle_d_select_01	Yep! I’m here to shop
kizuna_battle_d_select_02	I came to see you
kizuna_battle_d_02a	The school store’s a nice place! They’ve got\neverything you need right here![VAR 0114(0024)]
kizuna_battle_d_02b	Hahaha! So you came to see me, did you?[VAR 0114(0024)]
kizuna_battle_d_03	I’m here to check out the sandwiches they’ve got\nfor sale.[VAR 0114(0024)]
kizuna_battle_d_04	The school store’s sandwiches taste great and\nhave excellent nutritional balance, too![VAR 0114(0024)]
kizuna_battle_d_select_03	You’re not making your own?
kizuna_battle_d_select_04	What happened to your intensive training?
kizuna_battle_d_05	Haha. I guess I’m just not used to it yet. All that\ntraining kind of wore me out![VAR 0114(0024)]
kizuna_battle_d_06	I achieved my goal, anyway, so I’m going to take\na break from sandwich making for a bit![VAR 0114(0024)]
kizuna_battle_d_07	Oh, right. I didn’t tell you what my goal was.\c\nI wanted to pay Nurse Miriam back for everything\nshe does for me. It was my way of saying thanks![VAR 0114(0024)]
kizuna_battle_d_08	She’s so nice and so skilled at what she does.\nI really look up to her![VAR 0114(0024)]
kizuna_battle_d_09	I wanted to try sandwich making so I could be\nskilled at doing something for other people, like\r\nshe is, but I guess I just wasn’t cut out for it.[VAR 0114(0024)]
kizuna_battle_d_10	What I am cut out for, though, is being full of\nenergy! So I decided to focus on that instead![VAR 0114(0024)]
kizuna_battle_d_11	Like I said in class, I think people and Pokémon\nshould make their strong points stronger![VAR 0114(0024)]
kizuna_battle_d_12	You really helped me out, new kid! Take this as\nmy way of saying thanks.[VAR 0114(0024)]
kizuna_battle_d_13	All right, then! What should I go with today to\nget my protein in?[VAR 0114(0024)]
kizuna_battle_d_system_01	You formed a close bond with Ms. Dendra!
kizuna_botan_a.tbl
kizuna_botan_a_01	Gyah! What—? [VAR 0100(0000)]?![VAR 0114(0008)]
kizuna_botan_a_02	Hurry up and hide! And keep quiet, OK?[VAR 0114(0008)]
kizuna_botan_a_03	Phew... That was close.[VAR 0114(0008)]
kizuna_botan_a_select_01	Whatcha doing?
kizuna_botan_a_select_02	Something up?
kizuna_botan_a_04	Um... Yeah, you know, I’m just... Errr...\c\n*sigh*\nGuess I might as well come clean.[VAR 0114(0008)]
kizuna_botan_a_05	Take a look over there.[VAR 0114(0008)]
kizuna_botan_a_06	Do you get it now?[VAR 0114(0008)]
kizuna_botan_a_select_03	...Not really?
kizuna_botan_a_select_04	A little context, please?
kizuna_botan_a_07	Ah. Sorry. Your jump scare earlier completely\nfrazzled me. My brain’s still trying to reboot.[VAR 0114(0008)]
kizuna_botan_a_08	All right, here’s the sitch. Team Star’ve started\ncoming to school again...[VAR 0114(0008)]
kizuna_botan_a_09	But I don’t know if they’re gonna fit in OK, and\nit’s been playing on my mind, you know?\r\nSo I’m checking on them from over here...[VAR 0114(0008)]
kizuna_botan_a_aku_01	Hmph... Guess we’re still not exactly gettin’ a\nwarm welcome here, huh?[VAR 0114(0021)]
kizuna_botan_a_fairy_01	Well, duh.[VAR 0114(0020)]
kizuna_botan_a_fairy_02	Sure, the teachers finally figured out we’re not a\nbunch of delinquents...[VAR 0114(0020)]
kizuna_botan_a_fairy_03	But it’s not like we can press some magic button\nto make everyone else accept us.[VAR 0114(0020)]
kizuna_botan_a_aku_02	True story. We gotta fix this, my man. Time for a\nchange of tack![VAR 0114(0021)]
kizuna_botan_a_10	Huh? A change of tack...?\c\nWhat, are they gonna start wearing normal school\nuniforms so they stop scaring off the other kids?[VAR 0114(0008)]
kizuna_botan_a_11	Oh, Momo... Ortie... They’re both really trying\ntheir best to fit in here at school...[VAR 0114(0008)]
kizuna_botan_a_fairy_04	A “change of tack,” huh? What exactly are\nyou suggesting?[VAR 0114(0020)]
kizuna_botan_a_aku_03	Buh? I mean, uhhh...[VAR 0114(0021)]
kizuna_botan_a_aku_04	How ’bout we say a big, friendly howdy to\neveryone here? Like, just yell it. Loud as we can.[VAR 0114(0021)]
kizuna_botan_a_fairy_05	WHAT?! That’s stupid! Go on and embarrass\nyourself if you want to, but count me out![VAR 0114(0020)]
kizuna_botan_a_12	Errr. Yeah, that idea seems a bit...off.[VAR 0114(0008)]
kizuna_botan_a_aku_05	Hold up—lemme explain.[VAR 0114(0021)]
kizuna_botan_a_aku_06	You know Ryme, right? She does this at her\nconcerts, no joke.[VAR 0114(0021)]
kizuna_botan_a_aku_07	If the crowd ain’t hyped at the start of the show,\nshe’ll shout the loudest greetin’ you ever heard\r\ninto the mike. Like “S’UP Y’ALL” or whatever!\c\nLifts the mood like nobody’s business.[VAR 0114(0021)]
kizuna_botan_a_fairy_06	Yeah, that makes sense. ’Cause those are\nCONCERTS. This is SCHOOL. It’s different.[VAR 0114(0020)]
kizuna_botan_a_aku_08	OK, smart guy. So we’re optin’ for the cold\nshoulder treatment forever, then, are we?[VAR 0114(0021)]
kizuna_botan_a_fairy_07	N-no... That’d totally suck.[VAR 0114(0020)]
kizuna_botan_a_aku_09	It would, wouldn’t it? So yeah. Our only option is\nto yell at everyone so they know we’re nice.\r\nHere, I’m gonna go for it...[VAR 0114(0021)]

kizuna_botan_a_mob_01	Are those guys from Team Star? What the heck\nare they yelling for?
kizuna_botan_a_mob_02	Is this some kind of skit? Heh...they’re pretty\nfunny!
kizuna_botan_a_mob_03	I guess they’re not as scary as I thought...?
kizuna_botan_a_14	No way...[VAR 0114(0008)]
kizuna_botan_a_15	P-people are actually warming up to them?!\nWhy? That makes zero sense![VAR 0114(0008)]
kizuna_botan_a_16	Haaah... Momo and Ortie really are operating\non a different level. I’m kind of amazed.[VAR 0114(0008)]
kizuna_botan_a_17	Seems all my worrying was for nothing, huh?[VAR 0114(0008)]

kizuna_botan_b_doku_09	I shall fix them with my piercing gaze and beg on\nbended knee for the ninja garments I so crave![VAR 0114(0023)]
kizuna_botan_b_07	Whaaaaaat?! Since WHEN was Atticus this\ngood-looking?![VAR 0114(0008)]

kizuna_botan_b_doku_13	...I beg your pardon?[VAR 0114(0023)]
kizuna_botan_b_student_03	When I came here earlier, the shopkeeper lady\nwas putting them out on the shelves.\c\nSo I bought one for you and one for me!

kizuna_botan_c_hono_14	I realized somethin’ when I saw that real simple-\nlookin’ Fletchling painting on the wall there.\c\nI don’t hafta be some genius artist. I just wanna\nmake art that has its own charm, y’know?[VAR 0114(001F)]
kizuna_botan_c_student_07	The Fletchling painting? Um...I did that one.
kizuna_botan_c_hono_15	That one’s YOURS?! I thought it was, like, a\nfinger painting by a kindergartener or something![VAR 0114(001F)]
kizuna_botan_c_student_08	Ha ha! Yeah, I get that all the time.
kizuna_botan_c_mobs_01	Our president’s paintings are real lovable ’cause\nthey’re real simple! Everyone says so!

kizuna_botan_c_mobs_03	Your boots are awesome! Can I get a closer look?
kizuna_botan_c_hono_17	Th-the name’s Mela... And yeah, good eye!\nMy boots are the best. A pal of mine who’s a\r\nbig arts-and-crafts nerd made them for me.[VAR 0114(001F)]
kizuna_botan_c_11	So the raid thing was just a misunderstanding...\c\nWell, that’s a relief. But wow...I didn’t know that\nMellie wanted to join the art club.[VAR 0114(0008)]
kizuna_botan_c_kakutou_05	I can’t wait to see what Mellie paints! I bet it’ll be\nsomething amazing, huh?[VAR 0114(0022)]
kizuna_botan_c_12	Yeah, I guess...[VAR 0114(0008)]

kizuna_botan_c_kakutou_06	Wait, were you supposed to be hiding?\c\nI was wondering what was going on—you were\njust kinda hanging out in the open over here...[VAR 0114(0022)]
kizuna_botan_c_kakutou_07	But you don’t need to worry anyway. Mellie’s\nbeen too nervous to notice you.[VAR 0114(0022)]
kizuna_botan_c_14	Wow. So even Mellie gets the jitters sometimes.[VAR 0114(0008)]
kizuna_botan_c_kakutou_08	Trying new things is scary for everyone.\nThat’s why I came with her for moral support.\r\nBut you know? I think she’ll be just fine.[VAR 0114(0022)]
kizuna_botan_c_kakutou_09	And she’s not the only one doing something new!\nCarmen and I have started up a wrestling club.[VAR 0114(0022)]
kizuna_botan_c_kakutou_10	Mellie will have a blast here, I’m sure, so I gotta\nkeep up with her! I’ll enjoy the time I have left at\r\nthe academy as much as I can![VAR 0114(0022)]

kizuna_botan_d_07	Wait, seriously? Is it the boxes from all my online\norders? Maybe I oughta get rid of ’em, huh...[VAR 0114(0008)]
kizuna_botan_d_08	Anyway, you must be wondering why I brought\nyou here. It’s about my Team Star friends.[VAR 0114(0008)]
kizuna_botan_d_09	They...they really mean the world to me. I love\nthem all so much that I got scared they weren’t\r\ngonna fit in OK or be happy at school.[VAR 0114(0008)]
kizuna_botan_d_10	That’s why I’ve been sorta spying on them since\nthey came back.[VAR 0114(0008)]
kizuna_botan_d_11	But it turns out I didn’t need to worry.\nThey’re already having a great time![VAR 0114(0008)]
kizuna_botan_d_12	And now I feel bad that I didn’t have it in me to\nbelieve in them in the first place...[VAR 0114(0008)]
kizuna_botan_d_13	They’ve all grown so much, but I haven’t changed\nsince Operation Starfall.\c\nI’m still scheming up ways to fix things by myself\ninstead of having a little faith.[VAR 0114(0008)]
kizuna_botan_d_select_03	It’s only natural you’d worry
kizuna_botan_d_select_04	You just need to believe in them!
kizuna_botan_d_14a	Y-you really think so? That’s a normal thing for\nfriends to do?[VAR 0114(0008)]
kizuna_botan_d_14b	Y-yeah. I know. I promise I’ll try, but it might take\nme a little while to get there.[VAR 0114(0008)]
kizuna_botan_d_15	Huh... I feel better after talking it out with you,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]. Thanks.[VAR 0114(0008)]

kizuna_botan_d_17b	That goes for Nemona as well! And even Arven\nand Miraidon![VAR 0114(0008)]
kizuna_botan_d_18	You know, I don’t normally like having people in\nmy room.[VAR 0114(0008)]

kizuna_dragon_a_02	I have a question for you. Do you find my class\ndifficult?[VAR 0114(0012)]
kizuna_dragon_a_select_01	A little bit, yeah...
kizuna_dragon_a_select_02	It’s just right for me!
kizuna_dragon_a_03	Hmm... Perhaps I need to improve how I convey\nthe material.[VAR 0114(0012)]
kizuna_dragon_a_04	That is certainly good to hear.[VAR 0114(0012)]
kizuna_dragon_a_05	So, [VAR 0100(0000)]...[VAR 0114(0012)]
kizuna_dragon_a_06	You chose to take on the Gyms as part of your\nTreasure Hunt.[VAR 0114(0012)]
kizuna_dragon_a_07	That must mean you like Pokémon battles. Is that\ncorrect?[VAR 0114(0012)]
kizuna_dragon_a_08a	One naturally becomes skilled at doing what they\nenjoy. That must be why you are so strong.[VAR 0114(0012)]
kizuna_dragon_a_08b	Then you’re attempting to overcome a weakness?\nI applaud your efforts, indeed![VAR 0114(0012)]
kizuna_dragon_a_10	Ah, do forgive me for springing such an odd\nquestion upon you so suddenly.[VAR 0114(0012)]
kizuna_dragon_a_11	I often find myself pondering the nature of\nstrength these days...[VAR 0114(0012)]
kizuna_dragon_a_12	[VAR BD06(0000)]Anyway, thank you again for your input,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0012)]

kizuna_dragon_b_select_01	You think so?
kizuna_dragon_b_select_02	I know what you mean...

kizuna_dragon_b_tamer_01	Master Hassel. Might I have a word?
kizuna_dragon_b_05	You... What are you doing here?[VAR 0114(0012)]
kizuna_dragon_b_06	I have told you many times not to bother me\nhere at the academy.[VAR 0114(0012)]
kizuna_dragon_b_tamer_02	Yet, I am bound to come. Our family’s future is of\nparamount importance.

kizuna_dragon_c_03	I’m sorry. I was lost in thought and didn’t notice\nyour approach.[VAR 0114(0012)]
kizuna_dragon_c_04	I feel I must again apologize for what transpired\nin the schoolyard...[VAR 0114(0012)]
kizuna_dragon_c_select_01	It didn’t bother me
kizuna_dragon_c_select_02	What’re you talking about?
kizuna_dragon_c_05a	Hah... That is very magnanimous of you.[VAR 0114(0012)]
kizuna_dragon_c_05b	I’m of course referring to how I rather suddenly\nhad to take my leave while we were still engaged\r\nin conversation.[VAR 0114(0012)]
kizuna_dragon_c_06	That woman who showed up is a Dragon Tamer—\nand a relative of mine, I might add.[VAR 0114(0012)]
kizuna_dragon_c_08	You see, I come from a very long line of Trainers\nwho specialize in Dragon-type Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0012)]
kizuna_dragon_c_09	There was a child in our family who was expected\nto stand at its head and lead it to greatness.[VAR 0114(0012)]
kizuna_dragon_c_10	But the young lad, rebellious little fellow that he\nwas, ran away from home one day.[VAR 0114(0012)]
kizuna_dragon_c_11	He made quite the show of it, too, swearing he’d\n“make a living with music”![VAR 0114(0012)]
kizuna_dragon_c_12	A lot happened since then, and...now he’s the art\nteacher and Elite Four member before you![VAR 0114(0012)]
kizuna_dragon_c_13	After I so rudely took my leave during our last\nconversation, my dear relative...encouraged me\r\nto give up teaching and return home at last.[VAR 0114(0012)]
kizuna_dragon_c_14	I’ve been told the current leader of my family—\nthat is to say, my father—is in poor health.[VAR 0114(0012)]
kizuna_dragon_c_15	Oh, but I do apologize. Perhaps I am not cut out\nfor teaching after all... What sort of teacher\r\ngrumbles on and on at his own student?[VAR 0114(0012)]
kizuna_dragon_c_select_03	You’re a great teacher!
kizuna_dragon_c_select_04	I don’t want you to quit teaching!

kizuna_dragon_d_tamer_03	H-how could you?! Are you saying you don’t care\nwhat happens to our proud lineage?!
kizuna_dragon_d_08	I am saying that I have other priorities![VAR 0114(0012)]
kizuna_dragon_d_09	Have a look around at the art decorating this\nroom, would you?[VAR 0114(0012)]
kizuna_dragon_d_10	The children here are letting their senses—their\nperceptiveness—grow freely![VAR 0114(0012)]
kizuna_dragon_d_11	I do not wish to say that protecting our family’s\nancient bloodline is of no importance...[VAR 0114(0012)]
kizuna_dragon_d_12	I simply wish to see young talent blossom and\ngrow into the future.[VAR 0114(0012)]
kizuna_dragon_d_13	It just seems so much more fun to me, if I’m\nbeing honest![VAR 0114(0012)]
kizuna_dragon_d_tamer_04	What utter nonsense.
kizuna_dragon_d_tamer_05	And yet...
kizuna_dragon_d_tamer_06	Your fearless, unflinching commitment to that\nnonsensical vision proves that you’re worthy of\r\ncarrying the will of the dragons, Master Hassel.
kizuna_dragon_d_tamer_07	I will not give up. I will come as many times as I\nneed to in order to change your mind.
kizuna_dragon_d_14	Oh, by all means, my door is open! I think you’ll\nsoon find you’ve met your match in stubbornness.[VAR 0114(0012)]
kizuna_dragon_d_15	You thought I could be cowed by some story\nspun up about my father’s deteriorating health?\r\nI am not so easily fooled![VAR 0114(0012)]
kizuna_dragon_d_tamer_08	Tch! I will return another day!
kizuna_dragon_d_16	Ah, I’m sorry you had to see all of that.[VAR 0114(0012)]
kizuna_dragon_d_17	I was so very close to resigning my post as\nteacher and returning to my home...[VAR 0114(0012)]
kizuna_dragon_d_18	[VAR BD06(0000)]but the students here gave me courage to say no.\nThat includes you, [VAR 0100(0000)].\r\nYour\r\nwords\r\ntruly\r\nbrought\r\nme strength.[VAR 0114(0012)]
kizuna_dragon_d_19	I cannot think of a way I can possibly repay my\ndebt to you young ones.[VAR 0114(0012)]
kizuna_dragon_d_20	Take this, if you will—insufficient as it may be in\nexpressing the full breadth of my gratitude.[VAR 0114(0012)]
kizuna_dragon_d_21	Now then! Let it be clear to all![VAR 0114(0012)]
kizuna_dragon_d_22	I, Hassel, will continue on my chosen path as\ninstructor to the youths of our world![VAR 0114(0012)]

kizuna_head_c_select_06	Long locks
kizuna_head_c_select_07	Giant pompadours
kizuna_head_c_06a	Oh? Is that so?\c\nI suppose I have indeed seen some of the\nacademy’s male students sporting such a style.[VAR 0114(000A)]
kizuna_head_c_06b	Oho! Pompadours, you say? I suspected as much!\c\nThough I don’t seem to recall many of the\nacademy’s male students sporting such a style...[VAR 0114(000A)]
kizuna_head_c_07	Could it be, then, that the pompadour has\nalready had its day in the sun...?\c\nPerhaps I ought to consider a change of wig...[VAR 0114(000A)]

kizuna_health_b_08	Me, on the other hand...[VAR 0114(0028)]
kizuna_health_b_09	I actually wanted to become a teacher.[VAR 0114(0028)]
kizuna_health_b_10	I’m just the school nurse, y’know? I can’t teach\nclasses or anything like that.[VAR 0114(0028)]
kizuna_health_b_11	I couldn’t pass the certification exam to become\nan actual health teacher.[VAR 0114(0028)]
kizuna_health_b_12	I took it so many times, but no luck. So here I\nam...stuck forever in the nurse’s office.[VAR 0114(0028)]

kizuna_health_c_06	You must really be having an adventure out there,\njudging from those scrapes and cuts![VAR 0114(0028)]
kizuna_health_c_07	Huh? Oh yeah, I guess it is pretty unusual for me\nto be out of the nurse’s office like this.[VAR 0114(0028)]
kizuna_health_c_08	Hehe. Well...I’m actually doing a bit of studying.[VAR 0114(0028)]

kizuna_health_d_08	Thanks for giving me the push I needed to try\nagain, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0028)]

kizuna_history_a_select_01	I like new stuff
kizuna_history_a_select_02	I prefer older things
kizuna_history_a_05	You would answer “new stuff” to me, your history\nteacher? Ha! You really are a curious one.[VAR 0114(0027)]
kizuna_history_a_06	Ah. So you prefer the things of the past, do you?\nThe potential I saw in you was real after all.[VAR 0114(0027)]
kizuna_history_a_07	Yes, this one may indeed be of good use to\nme someday...[VAR 0114(0027)]

kizuna_history_b_01	[VAR BD06(0000)]Why, if it isn’t [VAR 0100(0000)] from\nclass 1-A.[VAR 0114(0027)]
kizuna_history_b_02	Are you perhaps interested in the rest of the old\ntale I told you in class?[VAR 0114(0027)]
kizuna_history_b_03	Heh. It is...convenient that you would take the\nbait I presented in class.[VAR 0114(0027)]
kizuna_history_b_04	Don’t lie to me. Your desire to fulfill your\nintellectual curiosity is made plain as day by that\r\nlook on your face.[VAR 0114(0027)]
kizuna_history_b_05	A vessel, a sword, a set of tablets, and a set of\nbeads... After obtaining these four treasures, the\r\nking’s castle was destroyed. Why, you ask?[VAR 0114(0027)]
kizuna_history_b_06	Because these four treasures were actually\nfour Pokémon![VAR 0114(0027)]
kizuna_history_b_07	As these Pokémon were passed from human hand\nto human hand as treasures, they slowly became\r\ntainted by hubris and greed.[VAR 0114(0027)]
kizuna_history_b_08	Finally, after coming in contact with the rapacity\nof the king at that time, they awakened as\r\ndisasters and began to rampage out of control.[VAR 0114(0027)]
kizuna_history_b_09	The king called for renowned Pokémon wielders\nto defend the country and, after a fierce battle,\r\nthese incarnations of disaster were quelled.[VAR 0114(0027)]
kizuna_history_b_10	It is said that these four Pokémon were then\nsealed away somewhere in Paldea.[VAR 0114(0027)]
kizuna_history_b_11	So, what do you think? Would you say this story\nis just make-believe?[VAR 0114(0027)]
kizuna_history_b_12	What?! Where’s your sense of adventure?[VAR 0114(0027)]
kizuna_history_b_13	Heh...very astute of you.[VAR 0114(0027)]
kizuna_history_b_14	I have read many historical disaster reports,\npersonal journals, and the like.\c\nThere is much to support the truth of this story.[VAR 0114(0027)]
kizuna_history_b_15	If I am able to prove the story’s veracity myself,\nI will be sure to let you know.[VAR 0114(0027)]

kizuna_history_c.tbl
kizuna_history_c_01	[VAR 0100(0000)]! The time has come![VAR 0114(0027)]
kizuna_history_c_02	The cursed treasures... The four Pokémon of ruin...[VAR 0114(0027)]
kizuna_history_c_03	They exist![VAR 0114(0027)]
kizuna_history_c_04	And I stumbled upon the truth in the newspaper,\nof all places! Hah! In an interview piece with a\r\ncarpenter, no less![VAR 0114(0027)]
kizuna_history_c_05	The Pokémon wielders apparently used sacred\nstakes to seal these treasures of ruin in shrines.[VAR 0114(0027)]
kizuna_history_c_06	There is a separate shrine for each of the four\nPokémon, and eight stakes driven into the ground\r\nin the areas surrounding each shrine keep the\r\npower of ruin at bay.[VAR 0114(0027)]
kizuna_history_c_07	In other words, if all of the stakes for a given\nshrine were to be removed...[VAR 0114(0027)]
kizuna_history_c_08	it would release the Pokémon held inside![VAR 0114(0027)]
kizuna_history_c_09	Don’t you think it would be nice to free those\nPokémon from the confines of their tiny little\r\nshrines, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0027)]
kizuna_history_c_10	Heh. A kind soul, I see. You are proving\ntruly useful![VAR 0114(0027)]
kizuna_history_c_11	That’s surprisingly heartless of you! Come now—\ndo it for the Pokémon![VAR 0114(0027)]
kizuna_history_c_12	According to a descendant of the Pokémon\nwielders in the story, you must have a bond with\r\nPokémon in order to remove the stakes.[VAR 0114(0027)]
kizuna_history_c_13	I’m sure someone as Pokémon savvy as yourself\nwould have no trouble at all with that.[VAR 0114(0027)]
kizuna_history_c_14	You can choose for yourself whether to believe\nme or not, but I will mark the locations of these\r\nshrines on your map.[VAR 0114(0027)]
kizuna_history_c_15	I’d rather go myself, of course, but skipping out\non my classes to go adventuring seems to have\r\nmade the director a little suspicious of me...[VAR 0114(0027)]
kizuna_history_c_16	Heh. You can think of it as part of your Treasure\nHunt. Treasures of ruin are still treasures, after all.\c\nI hope you will investigate these shrines if you are\nat all inclined to do so.[VAR 0114(0027)]

kizuna_history_d_02	I hope you will investigate the shrines if you are\nat all inclined to do so.[VAR 0114(0027)]
kizuna_history_d_03	Hm? It seems to me that you don’t have anything\nnew to report on the treasures of ruin...[VAR 0114(0027)]
kizuna_history_d_04a	Oh! You caught Ting-Lu, the Vessel of Ruin?[VAR 0114(0027)]
kizuna_history_d_04b	Oh! You caught Chien-Pao, the Sword of Ruin?[VAR 0114(0027)]
kizuna_history_d_04c	Oh! You caught Wo-Chien, the Tablets of Ruin?[VAR 0114(0027)]
kizuna_history_d_04d	Oh! You caught Chi-Yu, the Beads of Ruin?[VAR 0114(0027)]
kizuna_history_d_05	Ohohooo! How interesting! I simply cannot keep\nmy curiosity under control![VAR 0114(0027)]
kizuna_history_d_06a	Judging by its shape and size, this vessel was\nalmost certainly NOT for everyday use.[VAR 0114(0027)]
kizuna_history_d_07a	Perhaps it was a work of art? Or, better yet, a\nritual artifact housing some sort of deity?![VAR 0114(0027)]
kizuna_history_d_08a	I feel that there must be some meaning behind\nthe horns and the designs resembling eyes.[VAR 0114(0027)]
kizuna_history_d_09a	Could it be that this artifact was fashioned after\nthe deity’s very appearance?![VAR 0114(0027)]
kizuna_history_d_06b	So the sword’s blade and hilt form the Pokémon’s\nleft and right fangs![VAR 0114(0027)]
kizuna_history_d_07b	I wonder if the sword broke when it became a\nPokémon... Or perhaps it was always that way?[VAR 0114(0027)]
kizuna_history_d_08b	No, wait—I cannot imagine the king wanting to\nbuy a broken sword.[VAR 0114(0027)]
kizuna_history_d_09b	Maybe it was some sort of weapon that was\nmeant to be used in this “broken” state?![VAR 0114(0027)]
kizuna_history_d_06c	I’ve never seen so many wooden writing tablets\nstrung together! It must have been an epic tale![VAR 0114(0027)]
kizuna_history_d_07c	Most excavated tablets are tantamount to graffiti\nor simple memos—still valuable tools for learning\r\nabout the past, but nothing like this![VAR 0114(0027)]
kizuna_history_d_08c	I can’t read it, but given the length...it must be\na story, yes! Or perhaps the words of a curse...?[VAR 0114(0027)]
kizuna_history_d_09c	If only the words weren’t faded! How frustrating!\nThese wooden tablets piqued the curiosity of a\r\nking! What might have been written on them?[VAR 0114(0027)]
kizuna_history_d_06d	Beads like these were thought to be sacred and\nthus were worn during religious rituals.[VAR 0114(0027)]
kizuna_history_d_07d	I believe they were most often worn as a single\nbead on the neck like a pendant, but it seems\r\nChi-Yu has four of them.[VAR 0114(0027)]
kizuna_history_d_08d	Were the beads worn in pairs, like on the ears\nand wrists? Or were the rituals perhaps\r\nperformed by four people?[VAR 0114(0027)]
kizuna_history_d_09d	What on earth could have caused beads such as\nthese—originally used to ward off disaster—to\r\nbecome bringers of disaster themselves?[VAR 0114(0027)]
kizuna_history_d_10	This mystery grows ever deeper. Ah! My thirst\nfor knowledge is slowly being quenched![VAR 0114(0027)]
kizuna_history_d_11	Hm? You look like you have something more to\nreport. What is it?[VAR 0114(0027)]
kizuna_history_d_12	Seeing part of history with my own eyes fills me\nwith joy. I thank you, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0027)]
kizuna_history_d_13	Please come back and report to me again if you\nfind more of the treasures of ruin.[VAR 0114(0027)]
kizuna_history_d_14	This is simply amazing. You have now reported\nback to me with all four of the treasures of ruin.[VAR 0114(0027)]
kizuna_history_d_15	I never thought that you would be able to do\nTHIS much for me.[VAR 0114(0027)]
kizuna_history_d_16	You have my thanks, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0027)]
kizuna_history_d_17	I would have liked to go looking for the treasures\nof ruin myself and make them my own.[VAR 0114(0027)]
kizuna_history_d_18	But I suppose it was precisely because I sent\nyou—someone with a pure heart—that we were\r\nable to accomplish this feat.[VAR 0114(0027)]
kizuna_history_d_19	They may be the treasures of my dreams, but I\nwill allow you to have them for now.[VAR 0114(0027)]
kizuna_history_d_20	Consider this a symbol of my gratitude, too.\nTake it. It is yours.[VAR 0114(0027)]
kizuna_history_d_21	[VAR BD06(0000)]Heh. You truly are an interesting one, aren’t\nyou, [VAR 0100(0000)]? I hope you\r\ndon’t\r\nmind\r\nif\r\nI\r\ncontinue\r\nto\r\nkeep an eye on you![VAR 0114(0027)]

kizuna_home_b_02	Are you here to eat as well?[VAR 0114(0029)]
kizuna_home_b_select_01	Yep! I’m starving
kizuna_home_b_select_02	I just kind of wandered in
kizuna_home_b_03a	Ha! Excellent. You shouldn’t battle on an empty\nstomach.[VAR 0114(0029)]
kizuna_home_b_03b	Drawn in by the irresistible aromas, I imagine.[VAR 0114(0029)]
kizuna_home_b_04	I myself am here to...survey the student cafeteria,\nlet’s say.[VAR 0114(0029)]
kizuna_home_b_05	I am observing the nutritional content of the food\nthat our students partake of on a regular basis.[VAR 0114(0029)]
kizuna_home_b_06	One item on the menu here that I am particularly\ninterested in is the Peanut Butter Sandwich.\r\nIt is sweet and quite delicious.[VAR 0114(0029)]
kizuna_home_b_07	Yes...perhaps I will order one right now.[VAR 0114(0029)]
kizuna_home_b_mob_01	Oh look! It’s Mr. Saguaro! He’s so fashionable\nand cool.
kizuna_home_b_mob_02	I guess the teachers come to the cafeteria too,\nhuh? D’you think he’ll have an Egg Sandwich?
kizuna_home_b_mob_03	No way! If he gets anything here, it’ll definitely\nbe something spicy, like the Five-Alarm Sandwich!
kizuna_home_b_mob_04	Ahhh! He’s so cool! He’ll definitely get that wild\nand spicy Five-Alarm Sandwich!
kizuna_home_b_08	... ... ...[VAR 0114(0029)]
kizuna_home_b_09	Could I have a...Five-Alarm Sandwich? I do enjoy\nthe thrill of spicy food.[VAR 0114(0029)]
kizuna_home_b_select_03	But, Mr. Saguaro! What about...?
kizuna_home_b_select_04	No! Have a Peanut Butter Sandwich!
kizuna_home_b_10	[VAR BD06(0000)]A-ah, yes. You suggested I have a Peanut Butter\nSandwich,\r\nM[VAR 1100(00FF,0305)]asteriss\r\n[VAR 0100(0000)]?\r\nI\r\nsuppose\r\nI\r\nshall\r\nhave\r\nto\r\ntry\r\none.\r\nIf\r\nyou insist.[VAR 0114(0029)]
kizuna_home_b_11	That was close. I almost forced myself to order\nsomething spicy—my least favorite of flavors.[VAR 0114(0029)]
kizuna_home_b_12	[VAR BD06(0000)]I thank you for restraining me,\nM[VAR 1100(00FF,0305)]asteriss [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0029)]
kizuna_home_b_13	It seems that the students tend to view me as\nfashionable and cool...or even—dare I say it?—\r\nexuding a sort of brooding strength.[VAR 0114(0029)]
kizuna_home_b_14	I have a habit of acting in such a way so as not to\ndestroy their image of me.[VAR 0114(0029)]
kizuna_home_b_15	I showed my true colors to you just now without\nthinking. Please keep this as a secret between us.[VAR 0114(0029)]

kizuna_home_c_select_01	You need my help?
kizuna_home_c_select_02	What is it?
kizuna_home_c_03	Well, you see, I do not want anyone to overhear\nthis, but...[VAR 0114(0029)]
kizuna_home_c_04	I hear rumors of an incredibly sweet condiment\nthat exists somewhere in the Paldea region.[VAR 0114(0029)]
kizuna_home_c_05	I absolutely must experience that ambrosial\nsweetness for myself.[VAR 0114(0029)]
kizuna_home_c_06	You are the only one who knows of my insatiable\nsweet tooth. Thus, I have no one else I can turn\r\nto for help in this matter.[VAR 0114(0029)]
kizuna_home_c_07	I cannot go looking for this condiment myself lest\nI destroy the image students have of me.[VAR 0114(0029)]
kizuna_home_c_08	I will repay you for your troubles, of course.\nGive it some thought if this piques your interest.[VAR 0114(0029)]
kizuna_home_c_09	In the meantime, I will gather what information I\ncan about this incredibly sweet condiment.[VAR 0114(0029)]

kizuna_home_d_03	It is called Sweet Herba Mystica![VAR 0114(0029)]
kizuna_home_d_04	If you should find it during the course of your\nTreasure Hunt, I would be grateful if you would\r\nshare some with me.[VAR 0114(0029)]

kizuna_home_d_system_01	Give Mr. Saguaro some of your Sweet\nHerba Mystica?

kizuna_home_d_mob_01	Hey, Mr. Saguaro! Whatcha eatin’?
kizuna_home_d_11	Ah![VAR 0114(0029)]

kizuna_home_d_12	N-no! You see, ah...there is a reason for this![VAR 0114(0029)]
kizuna_home_d_mob_03	You don’t LOOK like someone who likes sweets,\nbut that’s pretty cool!
kizuna_home_d_13	Pretty...cool?![VAR 0114(0029)]
kizuna_home_d_14	I have spent my entire life trying to maintain the\nimage that others have of me.[VAR 0114(0029)]

kizuna_language_a_02	Did you come all the way here to the staff room\njust to see me?[VAR 0114(0026)]

kizuna_language_b_poke_01	... ... ...
kizuna_language_b_07	Phew. That seems to have done the trick just in\nthe nick of time![VAR 0114(0026)]
kizuna_language_b_08	But this Pawmi doesn’t appear to belong to a\nTrainer. Hmm... Could a wild Pokémon have\r\nwandered onto the academy grounds?[VAR 0114(0026)]
kizuna_language_b_09	Still, I can’t just leave it here alone without\nanyone to make sure it’s OK.[VAR 0114(0026)]
kizuna_language_b_10	It’s decided, then! I, Salvatore, will just have to\nlend all of the helping hands I have to take care\r\nof Pawmi in this touch-and-go situation![VAR 0114(0026)]

kizuna_language_c_select_01	Is it feeling better now?
kizuna_language_c_select_02	It seems very...quiet?
kizuna_language_c_03	Hmm...yeah. It’s feeling better, but this particular\nPawmi may just be a bit meek, I suppose?[VAR 0114(0026)]
kizuna_language_c_ecology_01	I had Nurse Miriam take a look as well, and she\nsays there’s nothing wrong with it healthwise![VAR 0114(002A)]
kizuna_language_c_ecology_02	So it shouldn’t have any injuries, ailments, or\nthe like.[VAR 0114(002A)]
kizuna_language_c_poke_02	... ... ...
kizuna_language_c_04	Even so, it never utters so much as a cry, which\nis odd.[VAR 0114(0026)]
kizuna_language_c_05	That part has even Mr. Jacq here stumped.[VAR 0114(0026)]

kizuna_language_c_06	Ne t’inquiète pas! Don’t worry about it![VAR 0114(0026)]
kizuna_language_c_07	I have some more information now thanks to the\nacademy’s security cameras, though.[VAR 0114(0026)]
kizuna_language_c_08	It seems Pawmi was attacked by a wild Pokémon\nand fled here to the academy grounds.[VAR 0114(0026)]
kizuna_language_c_09	Maybe it’s still in a bit of shock from that\nexperience and can’t bring itself to speak yet?[VAR 0114(0026)]

kizuna_language_c_10	Yep! If that’s the case, there’s absolutely no\nproblem with keeping quiet! Pas de problème![VAR 0114(0026)]
kizuna_language_c_11	We can just attendre—wait, that is—until it feels\nlike talking! That’s all we can do, really![VAR 0114(0026)]
kizuna_language_c_12	Even if you can speak all sorts of languages,\nthere’s no guarantee that you can understand\r\nwhat’s going on in someone’s heart.[VAR 0114(0026)]
kizuna_language_c_13	But have no fear! I won’t give up! No—I’ll keep\non trying until we’ve figured each other out![VAR 0114(0026)]

kizuna_language_d_03	Hahaha! Well, it seems being quiet is simply a\npart of this one’s personality![VAR 0114(0026)]
kizuna_language_d_04	But it’s hard for a Pokémon to communicate with\nits fellows without speaking up.[VAR 0114(0026)]
kizuna_language_d_05	As you know, wild Pokémon use their cries to tell\neach other all sorts of things—like the location of\r\nfood or whether there are predators nearby.[VAR 0114(0026)]
kizuna_language_d_06	So even if I were to release it back into the wild,\nI’m afraid that it may not be able to do those\r\nsorts of things![VAR 0114(0026)]
kizuna_language_d_poke_02	... ... ...
kizuna_language_d_07	[VAR BD06(0000)]What do you think, [VAR 0100(0000)]?\nWhere\r\ndoes\r\nPawmi belong?[VAR 0114(0026)]
kizuna_language_d_select_01	How about here?
kizuna_language_d_select_02	With you, Mr. Salvatore!
kizuna_language_d_08a	Here? At the academy?[VAR 0114(0026)]
kizuna_language_d_08b	Oh?! I didn’t expect to hear mon nom—my name![VAR 0114(0026)]
kizuna_language_d_09	So you think it should stay here...with me![VAR 0114(0026)]
kizuna_language_d_10	I was so focused on getting it back in good\nhealth so it could return to the wild that I didn’t\r\neven consider that possibility![VAR 0114(0026)]
kizuna_language_d_11	What do you think about that idea, my little\nPawmi friend?[VAR 0114(0026)]
kizuna_language_d_poke_03	... ... ...
kizuna_language_d_poke_04	Pawmi!
kizuna_language_d_12	Pawmi! It spoke! At last![VAR 0114(0026)]
kizuna_language_d_13	Even without speaking Pokémon language myself,\nI know that that reply means “yes”![VAR 0114(0026)]
kizuna_language_d_14	[VAR BD06(0000)]Oh, my dear [VAR 0100(0000)]! Merci\nso\r\nvery,\r\nvery\r\nmuch\r\nfor\r\nall\r\nyour\r\nhelp\r\nwith Pawmi![VAR 0114(0026)]
kizuna_language_d_16	All the more reason you should have this—here,\na rare Pokémon for you to raise![VAR 0114(0026)]
kizuna_language_d_system_02	You received a Meowth from Mr. Salvatore!
kizuna_language_d_15	Ahhh, I’m so happy! Yes—I, Salvatore, will take\nit upon myself to look after Pawmi for good!\r\nI will indeed![VAR 0114(0026)]

kizuna_math_a_select_01	It stays the same
kizuna_math_a_select_02	It’s doubled
kizuna_math_a_select_03	It’s multiplied by 100
kizuna_math_a_08a	Yes, that’s right! The correct answer is that the\nmove’s damage is doubled.[VAR 0114(0025)]

kizuna_math_b_06	You see... Oh, how should I put this?[VAR 0114(0025)]
kizuna_math_b_07	Recently, there have been times when I feel as if\nI am being watched...[VAR 0114(0025)]
kizuna_math_b_08	Not by a Pokémon, mind you, but by a person.[VAR 0114(0025)]
kizuna_math_b_09	I thought it might be a ghost, so I tried asking my\nsister for help. She said it most likely isn’t one.\r\nShe’s good with Ghost-type Pokémon, you know.[VAR 0114(0025)]
kizuna_math_b_10	Perhaps one of my students is quietly watching\nme, waiting for a chance to ask me a question?[VAR 0114(0025)]

kizuna_math_d_05	Ah![VAR 0114(0025)]
kizuna_math_d_06	It’s you, isn’t it?! You’re the one who’s been\nsecretly watching me recently![VAR 0114(0025)]
kizuna_math_d_woman_01	T-Tyme?! How’d you know I—
kizuna_math_d_woman_02	I guess you must have noticed me... I-I’m so sorry!
kizuna_math_d_07	Well, of course I noticed—you were watching me\npractically all day every day, after all!\c\nI assume there’s something you want to ask me?[VAR 0114(0025)]
kizuna_math_d_woman_03	Y-yes...I do.
kizuna_math_d_woman_04	I’ve been a huge fan of yours since your time as\na Gym Leader! And I love Rock-type moves so\r\nvery much!
kizuna_math_d_08	Oh, my...[VAR 0114(0025)]
kizuna_math_d_woman_05	But you just suddenly retired from your post as\nGym Leader a year and a half ago...\c\nWhy did you quit?!
kizuna_math_d_09	My goodness... Is that all you wanted to ask?[VAR 0114(0025)]
kizuna_math_d_woman_06	Yes. Your reason for retiring was never\nmade public...
kizuna_math_d_woman_07	but it’s well known among the students here that\nyou just avoid the question any time it’s asked.
kizuna_math_d_woman_08	I thought it would be rude to ask you a question\nthat you don’t want to answer...so I just couldn’t\r\nfind the courage to ask.
kizuna_math_d_10	So that’s why your gaze felt so very intense. I see.\nForgive me.[VAR 0114(0025)]
kizuna_math_d_woman_09	So very...intense?
kizuna_math_d_11	Ah, never mind that. As for the reason I quit my\njob as Gym Leader, I simply wanted to focus\r\nmore on my job as a teacher.[VAR 0114(0025)]
kizuna_math_d_12	It’s not that I disliked being a Gym Leader or\nanything of that sort.[VAR 0114(0025)]
kizuna_math_d_13	Quite the contrary—talking about the Gym fills\nme with feelings of nostalgia and sadness.[VAR 0114(0025)]
kizuna_math_d_14	That’s why I always avoid answering the question\nwhen students ask.[VAR 0114(0025)]
kizuna_math_d_woman_10	Oh. I see...
kizuna_math_d_woman_11	Do you have any plans of becoming a Gym\nLeader again?
kizuna_math_d_15	No, I’m afraid I don’t plan to do so.[VAR 0114(0025)]
kizuna_math_d_16	My sister is doing a splendid job as Gym Leader\nin my stead.[VAR 0114(0025)]
kizuna_math_d_17	I personally find being a teacher most enjoyable\nthese days.[VAR 0114(0025)]
kizuna_math_d_18	But since I am, in fact, your teacher...I would\nappreciate it if you would call me “Ms. Tyme,”\r\nas students do, and not just “Tyme.”[VAR 0114(0025)]
kizuna_math_d_woman_12	OK. I’m sad to hear that, but I understand!
kizuna_math_d_woman_13	Thank you so much, Ms. Tyme!
kizuna_math_d_19	Well, I suppose that solves the mystery![VAR 0114(0025)]
kizuna_math_d_20	Ahhh, that made me so nervous! I said so many\nthings to try to sound cool![VAR 0114(0025)]
kizuna_math_d_21	I was certainly a little scared when I felt that girl’s\nintense gaze on me.[VAR 0114(0025)]
kizuna_math_d_22	But having you here with me allowed me to do\nwhat needed to be done to face what turned out\r\nto be one of my biggest fans.[VAR 0114(0025)]
kizuna_math_d_23	I must thank you for always showing up at just the\nright time, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0025)]
kizuna_math_d_24	Allow me to show you my appreciation a little.\nI hope these help on your adventure.[VAR 0114(0025)]

kizuna_rival_a_system_01	You spent two whole hours battling Pokémon\nwith Nemona!
kizuna_rival_a_05	Ahhh, good stuff![VAR 0114(0004)]

kizuna_rival_b_02	Yep, that’s me![VAR 0114(0004)]
kizuna_rival_b_mob_02	Ah hah hah...hah. Yeeeah. Maybe some\nother time.

kizuna_rival_b_04	Oh, him? Dunno who he was![VAR 0114(0004)]
kizuna_rival_b_05	I was just munching my sandwich and I heard him\nbragging about his tough Pokémon, so I invited\r\nhim to battle![VAR 0114(0004)]
kizuna_rival_b_06	I wonder what Pokémon he’s gonna use?\nCan’t wait to see![VAR 0114(0004)]
kizuna_rival_b_07	Wait, I forgot to get his contact info! How are we\nsupposed to plan when we’ll face off?[VAR 0114(0004)]
kizuna_rival_b_08	Oh well. I’ll make sure we battle next time I run\ninto him![VAR 0114(0004)]
kizuna_rival_b_09	Anyway, guess you came to get some grub, huh?[VAR 0114(0004)]

kizuna_rival_c_03	Oh my gosh, listen to this. Remember that guy\nfrom the cafeteria?[VAR 0114(0004)]
kizuna_rival_c_04	I ran into him again in the entrance hall, so I\nasked him to battle...but he said no![VAR 0114(0004)]
kizuna_rival_c_05	He was like, “What’s the point? You’re a\nChampion and a battle whiz—you’d wreck me!”[VAR 0114(0004)]
kizuna_rival_c_06	I don’t get what he meant! I mean, you can have\nfun battling even if you lose, right?[VAR 0114(0004)]
kizuna_rival_c_select_01	Yeah, you can
kizuna_rival_c_select_02	Winning’s nice, though...
kizuna_rival_c_07a	For real! I mean, sure, no one loves losing, but\nit’s definitely not pointless. It teaches you stuff![VAR 0114(0004)]
kizuna_rival_c_07b	Yeeeah, I guess so... Obviously I’d rather win than\nlose, but I just think it’s better to go into things\r\nwith a “losing can be fun, too” attitude![VAR 0114(0004)]
kizuna_rival_c_08	Man... Pokémon battles can get so complicated\nsometimes.[VAR 0114(0004)]
kizuna_rival_c_09	Oh, and I wish he hadn’t called me a whiz!\nI work hard at this stuff. It’s not like it all just\r\ncomes naturally to me![VAR 0114(0004)]
kizuna_rival_c_10	Like, throwing Poké Balls obviously doesn’t come\nnaturally to me, for one thing...[VAR 0114(0004)]
kizuna_rival_c_11	I think I need a mental reset. I’m gonna go find\nsomeone to battle![VAR 0114(0004)]

kizuna_rival_d_03	And lo and behold, I was right![VAR 0114(0004)]
kizuna_rival_d_04	Well, now that I’ve found you, we should swing\nby my room and have a chat![VAR 0114(0004)]

kizuna_rival_d_system_03	Yeah, you sure do
kizuna_rival_d_system_04	I noticed
kizuna_rival_d_10	Cool. And yeah, you know how when you really\nlike something, you dive in deep?[VAR 0114(0004)]
kizuna_rival_d_11	That’s what I did with Pokémon battles, and I...\njust kinda became a Champion?[VAR 0114(0004)]
kizuna_rival_d_12	But then I found out that’s pretty special—that\nnormally, it’s not so simple for most people.[VAR 0114(0004)]
kizuna_rival_d_13	People would tell me to my face that I’d only\nmanaged it ’cause I have some innate gift, or\r\n’cause I was raised differently, or whatever.[VAR 0114(0004)]
kizuna_rival_d_14	And suddenly I started to feel like there was this\ninvisible wall between me and everyone else.[VAR 0114(0004)]
kizuna_rival_d_15	So I started going easy when I’d battle my\nfriends. I just wanted everyone to have fun.[VAR 0114(0004)]
kizuna_rival_d_16	Oh, but don’t worry, I’m not doing that anymore!\nI’m going 100-percent all out![VAR 0114(0004)]

legend_0010_friend_10	Well, this might come as a surprise, but fact is,\nI’m all about that picnic life: the great outdoors,\r\nthe perfectly prepared sandwiches, all of it.\c\nNot half bad at cooking either, I can tell you.[VAR 0114(0006)]
legend_0010_friend_11	Right now I’m researching new recipes that’ll help\nPokémon feel better. Real health food, see.[VAR 0114(0006)]
legend_0010_friend_12	I found this book the other day, and it had a\nsection about these Herba Mystica things...[VAR 0114(0006)]
legend_0010_friend_13	Basically, they’re some kind of special herbs that\nheal up any Pokémon as soon as it eats them![VAR 0114(0006)]
legend_0010_friend_14	Now, there are a total of five different types of\nHerba Mystica, based on what I read.\c\nJust taking a little lick of them once they’ve been\npowdered will get your blood flowing, provide\r\nnutrients, prevent aging—it’ll even boost the\r\nimmune system![VAR 0114(0006)]
legend_0010_friend_15	These herbs seem like they’re the real deal.\nOnly found here in Paldea—and rare to boot![VAR 0114(0006)]
legend_0010_friend_16	But this book says they’re all guarded by Titan\nPokémon, meaning that it’s gonna be pretty\r\ntough to try to grab even a few sprigs.[VAR 0114(0006)]
legend_0010_friend_24	’Cause, see, Titans are— Well, I think they’ve\ngotta be...things like this![VAR 0114(0006)]
legend_0010_friend_17	I really want to get those herbs for myself, but...\nI’m not very good at Pokémon battles.[VAR 0114(0006)]
legend_0010_friend_18	Don’t have any friends with strong Pokémon to\nlend me a hand, either...\c\nAnd I’d never hear the end of it if I went crawling\nto that student council girl...[VAR 0114(0006)]
legend_0010_friend_19	But here you waltz up! You’ve got to help me out\nwith this—you’d be perfect![VAR 0114(0006)]
legend_0010_friend_20	Nope! Wait! I don’t need an answer yet![VAR 0114(0006)]
legend_0010_friend_23	I’ll just register the places where it seems there\nmight be Titans in your map app for you.[VAR 0114(0006)]
legend_0010_friend_21	Let it stew a bit, and we can get more into the\ndetails later. And in the meantime...take this.\r\nA little gift for listening and all.[VAR 0114(0006)]

sch_entrance01_girl_08	Reading out loud from your textbook gets your\nears and mouth in on the learning!

sub_043_picnicnpc_01_02	There you go. Try making some nice, tasty\nsandwiches! A picnic’s not a picnic without ’em!
sub_043_picnicnpc_01_06	Since you’re here, want to kick back with your\nPokémon at my picnic for a bit?
sub_043_picnicnpc_01_03	Hey, welcome to my picnic. Want to kick back\nwith your Pokémon for a bit?
sub_043_picnicnpc_01_04	Looks like you and your Pokémon got a good\nrest! Come on by and kick back anytime.
sub_043_picnicnpc_01_05	All right. But if you get worn out, don’t push it.\nJust come on by and kick back anytime.
sub_043_picnicnpc_02_01	My poor Bag’s full to bursting with ingredients!\nHere, lemme share some with you.
sub_043_picnicnpc_02_02	Sandwiches are best when you eat ’em outside!\nTry making some with the stuff I gave you!
sub_043_picnicnpc_02_06	Hey, since we’re here, want to have a picnic so\nyou can rest up a little?
sub_043_picnicnpc_02_03	Want to rest up a bit at my picnic?
sub_043_picnicnpc_02_04	You and your Pokémon look like you’re all full\nof energy! Come again anytime.
sub_043_picnicnpc_02_05	Aw, no need to be shy about it! You can come by\nanytime.
sub_043_picnicnpc_03_01	This spot is just about halfway between\nMesagoza and Artazon!\c\nI’m gonna make me a nice sandwich, then I’ll be\nall refueled and ready for more adventuring!\c\nHere—have some ingredients so you can get\nrefueled too!
sub_043_picnicnpc_03_02	Totally unrelated, but I heard there’s a cliff face\nnear here that...moves. Wonder if it’s true...
sub_043_picnicnpc_03_06	You should take a breather here and get ready so\nyou don’t get too surprised by any moving walls!
sub_043_picnicnpc_03_03	Are you running a little low on energy? Take a\nminute to rest and refuel!
sub_043_picnicnpc_03_04	Both people AND Pokémon need to refuel\nsometimes. Come back if you’re low on energy!
sub_043_picnicnpc_03_05	If you say so! Just remember not to push yourself\ntoo hard!
sub_043_picnicnpc_04_01	Whew, these hills are rougher than I thought\nthey’d be. I’m beat.\c\nTimes like these call for a nice meal to refresh\nthe body and soul!\c\nHere, take some of my ingredients to refresh\nyourself with!
sub_043_picnicnpc_04_02	Tackling tough challenges is great and all, but not\non an empty tummy!
sub_043_picnicnpc_04_06	We all need company and compassion, especially\non the road! Want to stop and refresh yourself?
sub_043_picnicnpc_04_03	Hills got you down? Need a little pick-me-up?
sub_043_picnicnpc_04_04	It’s nice to have a refreshing meal! We gotta help\neach other out in tough times. Stop by anytime!
sub_043_picnicnpc_04_05	Amazing what young folks like you can do! Wish I\nstill had that pep in my step!
sub_043_picnicnpc_05_01	Nothing goes with a sandwich like a nice view!\nHaha!\c\nGlad to have run into you, kiddo. Here’s a gift—\nmake sure to savor the taste of adventure!
sub_043_picnicnpc_05_02	Eating a sandwich and getting pumped with Meal\nPowers makes journeying all the better! Haha!
sub_043_picnicnpc_05_06	Care to rest those traveling feet and stop for a\nwhile, since you’re here?
sub_043_picnicnpc_05_03	Everyone needs a break now and then! Care to\nrest those traveling feet and enjoy the scenery?
sub_043_picnicnpc_05_04	Working hard is key, but so is getting off your\nfeet now and then! Besides, you can’t enjoy the\r\nscenery when you’re always on the move! Haha!
sub_043_picnicnpc_05_05	Fair enough—nothing wrong with living fast!\nCome by if you ever need a little rest.
sub_043_picnicnpc_06_01	I bought some ingredients on the cheap at the\nPorto Marinada market!\c\nBut I got more than I could eat, so...voilà! Have\nsome for yourself!
sub_043_picnicnpc_06_02	If you have a picnic with your friends and all\nbring lots of ingredients, you can whip up some\r\npretty wild sandwiches! It’s fun!
sub_043_picnicnpc_06_06	For now, though, you ought to take a breather—\nit’s rough going around these parts!
sub_043_picnicnpc_06_03	Going north or south from here is rough. You\nought to take a breather before you move on!
sub_043_picnicnpc_06_04	There you go—seems like you got a nice rest!\nGood luck on your adventure!
sub_043_picnicnpc_06_05	Ah, maybe you’re just headed west to Porto\nMarinada? I’ll mind my own business!
sub_043_picnicnpc_07_01	I saw some strange Pokémon around Casseroya\nLake, and they gave me a flash of inspiration!\c\nI came up with some great recipes—please use\nthem to make yourself some tasty sandwiches!
sub_043_picnicnpc_addrecipe_01	You learned how to make [VAR FF00(0006)]Sushi Sandwiches[VAR FF00(0000)]!
sub_043_picnicnpc_07_02	Now, I know sushi’s normally a rice dish. No\nbread’s involved.\c\nBut I figured...why not put sushi in a sandwich?\nThen you’ve got bread AND rice—twice as tasty!
sub_043_picnicnpc_07_06	Seeing as how we’ve run into each other at this\nnice lake, want to join me for a little break?
sub_043_picnicnpc_07_03	Ahhh, a lakeside picnic! Nothing better! Care to\nrest up?
sub_043_picnicnpc_07_04	I wonder what makes lakes so relaxing... Well,\nwhatever it is, it looks like you had a nice rest!

sub_047_picnicnpc_03_01	Oh, it’s you again!\c\nI’m making some new recipes, but they require\nsome very rare ingredients.\c\nFive different ingredients, actually.

t04_01	Welcome to Artazon, a town where the flowers\nare as bright and colorful as the artwork!
t04_09	Look at the conflict on this Sunflora’s face! What\ncould the artist have been feeling?
t04_12	I told my girlfriend clear as day, “let’s meet at the\nweird sculpture!” What’s taking her so long?
t04_26	My boyfriend said we’d meet at “the weird\nsculpture,” but that hardly narrows it down...
t04_31	Come on in and see if you can reach the center\nof Artazon’s famous hedge maze!
t04_36	When the spring winds start to blow, Sunkern\ncome riding in on ’em.
t04_58	Hmm, yes. Highly conceptual, accentuated with\ncontrasting modalities. Not that an amateur\r\nwould pick up on all that.
t04_64	I came to see this famous piece! I can’t say I\nreally get it, but I like it!
t04_65	Aw, not another dead end! I’m so lost...
t04_69	Whoa, you actually found your way here! Nice!\c\nAlmost no one ever makes it this far, so I decided\nto make it into my secret base!
t04_74	If you get worn out, try stopping for a breather.\nYou might notice things you didn’t before.
t04_76	I can’t believe Sunkern turn into Sunflora when\nthey evolve! Evolution’s wild!
t04_105	Check out my Cyclizar! We’re going on all sorts\nof journeys together!
t04_115	This must be a Brassius original! Though the style\nseems a little...off.
t04_118	I love high places! I heard outside of town, there\nare big, tall watchtowers in some places!
t05.tbl
t05_01	I came across the desert with Cyclizar, and I’m\ntotally exhausted!\c\nHealing up my team at the Pokémon Center gives\nthis human a chance to rest up, too!
t05_03	This is Porto Marinada. Our famed market is\nalways bustling!
t05_08	Come on up, stop on by! All our goods are\nfresher than fresh! Anything catch your eye?
t05_10	Marinada comes from marinating, you know?\c\nWhen you soak food like meat or fish in lemon\njuice or vinegar sauce... Mmm, it’s delish!
t05_11	The food here is really yummy!\c\nEverything’s fresh and wriggly! Kinda like me!
t05_37	There’s a battle court right here in the market.\c\nNobody’s allowed to get into fights here—if\nyou’ve gotta work something out, you do it\r\nthrough a friendly Pokémon battle!
t05_38	People say that a long time ago, ’fore I was even\nborn, there were always fights breaking out here.\c\nBut not anymore! Now we get lots of tourists, and\neven kids can walk around and feel safe.
t05_39	Look at you, li’l M[VAR 1100(00FF,0302)]r.iss Student! Here to try your\nhand at the auction?\c\nCareful you don’t drive the price up too high, or\nyou’ll be crying into your empty pockets!
t05_52	When night falls upon the city, ghostly Pokémon\nappear up above...\c\nWhy do you think they come?
t05_66	A salty breeze coming in over the sea is so nice!\c\nI wonder if Steel-type Pokémon hate it, though?\nAll that salt must do a number on them...
t05_73	It’s so handy having a Pokémon you can ride!\nFeels like I oughta return the favor and let my\r\nPokémon ride on my back instead sometimes! Ha!
t05_82	More junk mail! Ugh!\c\nMaybe I’ll just crumple it all up into a ball that I\ncan throw around with my Pokémon...
t05_83	These big, long metal box things here are what\nwe call shipping containers.\c\nWe pack ’em full of goods and things to sell,\nthen ship ’em off across the sea.
t05_85	To get to other regions, we go by boat! Our\npoor Pokémon couldn’t carry us that far.
t05_86	I swam to those rocks out in the water, and I’m\npretty sure I spotted something on top of them.\c\nBut I don’t know how to get up there... I’m no\npro at climbing cliffs or anything...
t05_87	Yesss! I love goofy face boards! It never gets old\ntaking silly photos with ’em!
t05_88	Hey, so, like...I get Finizen’s deal. I’ve seen them\naround. But what about that macho-looking one?\r\nIs that...a different Pokémon or something?
t05_89	Oh my gosh, I’ve gotta get a shot of those\nKilowattrel flying over the ocean for my feed!\c\nYou sometimes find ’em resting on the beach\njust outside town, too.
t05_95	Have you been to eat at the Kofu Lounge in\nCascarrafa? They serve up all the freshest hauls\r\nthere—direct from Porto Marinada, of course!
t05_96	Ol’ man Kofu from the Cascarrafa Gym drops by\nthe market from time to time.\c\nThat old coot gets so excited whenever he wins\nat the auction that he dances a merry little jig!
t05_97	When I was younger, I got into my fair share of\nbidding wars and brawls both. I was a real spitfire!
t05_121	It’s such a nice beach, yet almost no one knows\nabout it! People just flock to the market instead.

t06_01	This is Medali! Kind of sounds like “medley,”\nright? A fitting name for a town with such a mix\r\nof people and things!
t06_10	Have you been to the Treasure Eatery? I hear the\nGym Leader is a regular there!
t06_18	We have the best food in all of Paldea! Come on\nin and give it a try!
t06_19	Our dishes here at Seafood Fresco are fresh and\npacked full of minerals!
t06_22	I think your Pokémon is saying it wants to come\neat here at my restaurant!
t06_31	I hear fancy restaurants have something called\na “dress code”...\r\nI wonder what kind of code that is?
t06_32	I want to feed my Pokémon something tasty!\nI need to save up my money.
t06_33	Our spicy dishes are the best! Come on in!
t06_42	We are currently open to customers with or\nwithout reservations.
t06_59	There’s a big gate at the top of the path leading\nto the Great Crater of Paldea. You can’t get in.
t06_60	I heard that there’s an off-limits facility called\nthe Zero Gate behind the gate up that path!
t06_61	Medali’s most famous restaurant, the Treasure\nEatery, is right here!\c\nWe also have the secret dish for those of you\ncurrently taking on the Gym Test!
t06_65	I heard that you can change your Pokémon’s Tera\nType at the Treasure Eatery, but the chef turned\r\nme away the moment I asked about it...
t06_79	How about a sandwich? They’re tempting even\nwhen you’re full—that’s how good they are!
t06_101	Before climbing Glaseado Mountain, I like to\nvisit the shopping area in Medali and fuel up\r\nwith something to eat.
t06_106	This town is an important hub here in Paldea.\c\nLots of people from other places come through,\nso naturally, lots of restaurants have popped up.
t06_107	My little Greedent here has gotten bigger\nrecently. I wonder if it’s about time to move to a\r\nbigger living space...
t06_109	The way up Glaseado Mountain is rough! Be sure\nyou’re prepared if you’re headed out that way.
t06_115	This town doesn’t have a battle court, y’know?\nI wonder where you battle the Gym Leader...
t06_117	Long ago, the space at the bottom of these stairs\nwas a stage for plays and concerts.
t06_133	Hello there, young’un. Are you a student? The\nTreasure Hunt’s rolled around again, then, eh?

t07_01	Welcome to Zapapico! It’s a mining town, full of\nhardworking folks.
t07_06	Sure, big cities are fun to go visit, but plain little\ntowns like this one have their own charm!
t07_07	The name Zapapico comes from a word for a\npickaxe. Fitting for a town of mostly miners, no?
t07_09	Nothing like finding a bench when you really\nneed one! You’ll understand when you’re older.
t07_11	I saw this Pokémon in the mine that was so big,\nit was like a mountain!
t07_12	Well, I saw a Pokémon so long it was like a river!
t07_16	Phanpy’s a Ground type! It’s resistant to poison,\nand it shrugs off electricity altogether!\c\nJust, um, don’t pour water on it.
t07_31	My buddies and I battle our Pokémon on that\ncourt on our way home from work.
t07_36	My job would be a lot harder without my dear\nCarkol around!\c\nBy that, I mean it provides moral support, not\njust manual labor...although it helps with that too.
t07_42	Once, I was on the verge of fainting a little ways\noutside town, when a wild Pokémon Center lady\r\nappeared and came to my rescue!

t08_01	Montenevera is a town with lotsa snow and lost\nsouls. But lately, the concerts are a real draw too!
t08_02	The fluttering snow! The flickering candlelight!\nEvery day is like a festival here! Don’t you think?
t08_06	The Snow Slope Run is popular these days. You\ncan try it out on Glaseado Mountain!
t08_08	Isn’t Snorunt cute? Only the females have a\nchance of evolving into Froslass.
t08_20	It’s cold again today. I’ll have something spicy to\neat to warm me up!
t08_22	Do you know about the ultimate class of\nsandwiches? They’re called “Master” sandwiches,\r\nand no one seems to know the recipes for them.
t08_23	Everything tastes better when you eat outside!
t08_26	The Gym Leader here used to be Tyme, but she\nretired a year and a half ago. Her sister Ryme is\r\nthe Gym Leader now.

t09_02	My family’s been making pottery for generations!\nIsn’t that cool?
t09_03	The water’s trickling out...\c\nI wish it’d shoot out like Hydro Pump, though.\nWouldn’t that be neat?
t09_05	This plate’s huuuge! How big of a sandwich d’you\nthink would fit on it?
t09_06	Tableware made in Alfornada is popular all\nacross Paldea!
t09_07	Pottery is born from the kiln!\c\nPotters put shaped clay inside and let it fire nice\nand slow for days.
t09_19	The battle court here was originally built as an\nobservatory to view the stars.
t09_23	There was a Pokémon that reminded me of tea\nup the hilly road ahead here.
t09_24	Wasn’t it rough coming all the way out to\nAlfornada?\c\nBut now that you’ve been here once, you can use\nthe Flying Taxi to come back whenever you want.
t09_30	Alfornada is in such an inconvenient location!\nHaving a trusty Cyclizar is an absolute must here.
t09_40	I actually came to see the Gym Leader, Tulip. But\nthese plates are super cute too!
t09_43	The Pokémon mosaic art on the observatory is\nreally cute, isn’t it?\c\nIt reminds me of some kind of old video game!

team_0020_nelke_05	I’m a pal of our mutual friend here. Isn’t that\nright, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(001E)]
team_0020_select_03	I guess...maybe?
team_0020_select_04	We’re not pals!
team_0020_nelke_06	Ahaha! Shy as ever, I see![VAR 0114(001E)]
team_0020_cassiopeia_08	We’re talking about going up against Team Star\nhere. It’s not something you can join in for fun.[VAR 0114(0009)]
team_0020_nelke_07	I’m well aware. I just need to sort out some...\nunsettled business with Team Star, that’s all.[VAR 0114(001E)]
team_0020_nelke_08	Besides, I tend to get the job done well. Not\nthat you can take my word for it, but it’s true.[VAR 0114(001E)]
team_0020_cassiopeia_09	... ... ...\c\nI suppose I’m hardly in a position to refuse help.\nWelcome to the operation, Clive.[VAR 0114(0009)]
team_0020_nelke_09	Great. That settles it, then.[VAR 0114(001E)]
team_0020_nelke_10	I think I heard your name earlier... Cassiopeia,\nwas it? Who exactly are you?[VAR 0114(001E)]
team_0020_cassiopeia_10	Team Star and I...share some history. That’s all I’ll\nsay for now.[VAR 0114(0009)]
team_0020_nelke_11	I see. In that case, I won’t press you further.[VAR 0114(001E)]
team_0020_cassiopeia_11	Good. Now, back to business—let’s talk\nOperation Starfall.[VAR 0114(0009)]
team_0020_nelke_12	Yes. What would you have us do?[VAR 0114(001E)]
team_0020_cassiopeia_12	Simply put, I want you to raid each one of\nTeam Star’s bases.[VAR 0114(0009)]
team_0020_cassiopeia_13	Then you’ll defeat the bosses of the team...and\nput an end to their rule![VAR 0114(0009)]
team_0020_nelke_13	“Put an end to their rule”...? You mean we need\nto oust these bosses from their roles somehow?[VAR 0114(001E)]
team_0020_cassiopeia_14	That’s right. Team Star is made up of five squads,\nand each of those squads has its own base.[VAR 0114(0009)]
team_0020_cassiopeia_15	You should be able to see the front gates of one\nof those bases now, in fact.[VAR 0114(0009)]
team_0020_nelke_14	Ah, yes...I can see them over there.[VAR 0114(001E)]
team_0020_cassiopeia_16	On the other side of those is the base proper.[VAR 0114(0009)]
team_0020_cassiopeia_17	And somewhere within that base lies one of your\ntargets: a squad boss.[VAR 0114(0009)]
team_0020_nelke_15	OK. I’m starting to get the idea.[VAR 0114(001E)]
team_0020_cassiopeia_18	Well, that’s just the outline. The key to the whole\noperation is the code that the team has to follow.[VAR 0114(0009)]
team_0020_cassiopeia_19	If someone challenges one of the squad bosses\nto a battle, they have no choice but to accept.[VAR 0114(0009)]
team_0020_cassiopeia_20	And what’s more, if they just so happen to lose\nthat battle...\c\nthey must forfeit their role as boss altogether![VAR 0114(0009)]
team_0020_cassiopeia_21	I went ahead and issued challenges to each base\nunder your name, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nThey’re basically declarations of war.[VAR 0114(0009)]
team_0020_cassiopeia_22	Now all of Team Star knows that we’re looking\nfor a fight.[VAR 0114(0009)]
team_0020_nelke_16	So let’s say we defeat all the bosses and they\nstep down from their roles... What happens next?[VAR 0114(001E)]
team_0020_cassiopeia_23	[~ 43]
team_0020_cassiopeia_24	The rest of the team crumbles with no one left to\nlead them. That’s what happens.[VAR 0114(0009)]
team_0020_nelke_17	[~ 45]
team_0020_cassiopeia_25	It’s a solid plan, but not without wrinkles.[VAR 0114(0009)]
team_0020_cassiopeia_26	Each base has a bunch of Pokémon inside to\nfend off intruders, and the bases themselves are\r\na considerable size.[VAR 0114(0009)]
team_0020_cassiopeia_27	Your garden-variety Trainer would be overrun\nlong before they’d get anywhere near the boss.[VAR 0114(0009)]
team_0020_cassiopeia_28	That’s why your skills are essential to this\noperation, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0009)]
team_0020_cassiopeia_29	[~ 50]
team_0020_cassiopeia_30	[~ 51]
team_0020_cassiopeia_31	Defeat the Pokémon inside the base, and drag\nthe boss out from where they’re hiding.[VAR 0114(0009)]
team_0020_cassiopeia_32	First things first, though—you’ll need to deal with\nany grunts that might be guarding the front gates.[VAR 0114(0009)]
team_0020_nelke_18	And what will you be doing in the meantime?[VAR 0114(001E)]
team_0020_cassiopeia_33	Like I said before, I have a history with Team Star.[VAR 0114(0009)]
team_0020_cassiopeia_34	That means I can’t operate out in the open.\nI’ll back you up from afar.[VAR 0114(0009)]
team_0020_nelke_19	All right. And what will my role be?[VAR 0114(001E)]
team_0020_cassiopeia_35	Sorry, but I don’t trust you completely just yet...\c\nFor now, I’d like you to monitor the bases and\nact as [VAR 0100(0000)]’s support.[VAR 0114(0009)]
team_0020_nelke_20	You’re a cautious one, all right... I respect that.[VAR 0114(001E)]
team_0020_cassiopeia_36	I’ll be in touch again when the plan advances to\nthe next stage. Good hunting out there.[VAR 0114(0009)]
team_0020_nelke_21	Welp. Go get ’em, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(001E)]
team_0020_select_05	Director Clavell...?

team_0110_cassiopeia_11	There’s only one thing left on the agenda.\c\nYou must defeat the big boss...and have Team\nStar disband for good![VAR 0114(0009)]
team_0110_select_01	How, though?
team_0110_select_02	Where’s the big boss?
team_0110_cassiopeia_12	Don’t worry—there’s no need to search them out.\nThe true identity of the big boss...[VAR 0114(0009)]
team_0110_cassiopeia_13	is none other than me.[VAR 0114(0009)]
team_0110_cassiopeia_14	I’m sorry...[VAR 0114(0009)]
team_0110_cassiopeia_15	I didn’t mean to keep it from you for so long, but\nthe right moment never came.[VAR 0114(0009)]
team_0110_cassiopeia_16	I’m the one who formed Team Star. Back then, the\nmembers of the team were my closest friends...\r\nand I treasured them more than anything.[VAR 0114(0009)]
team_0110_cassiopeia_17	If they go on like this, Team Star won’t do any\ngood for anyone.[VAR 0114(0009)]
team_0110_cassiopeia_18	They’ve got to give it up. So I’m using the code\nwe made together to force them to disband.[VAR 0114(0009)]
team_0110_cassiopeia_19	[VAR 0100(0000)]...\c\nI’ll be waiting for you in the schoolyard\n[VAR FF00(0006)]after dark[VAR FF00(0000)]. You should come as well, Clive.[VAR 0114(0009)]
team_0110_nelke_03	Understood.[VAR 0114(001E)]
team_0110_cassiopeia_20	Then I’ll see you both there.[VAR 0114(0009)]
team_0110_nelke_04	So Cassiopeia was the big boss of Team Star this\nwhole time... I scarcely thought it possible.\c\nBut with this revelation, I just might have an\ninkling as to their true identity...[VAR 0114(001E)]
team_0110_nelke_05	It seems we’ll find our answers after dark in the\nacademy’s schoolyard. Let’s prepare as best we\r\ncan before heading over.[VAR 0114(001E)]
team_0115.tbl
team_0115_nelke_01	’Sup, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(001E)]
team_0115_select_01	Director Clavell?
team_0115_select_02	Clive?
team_0115_nelke_02a	Oh, come on. The name’s Clive, remember?[VAR 0114(001E)]
team_0115_nelke_02b	Yup! That’s my name.[VAR 0114(001E)]
team_0115_nelke_03	Actually...no. It’s time for me to bring this little\nperformance to an end.[VAR 0114(001E)]
team_0115_nelke_04	Allow me to reveal my true identity![VAR 0114(001E)]
team_0115_nelke_05	Ha-hah![VAR 0114(001E)]
team_0115_nelke_06	I do apologize for deceiving you with my disguise.[VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0115_nelke_07a	In truth, the boy you knew as Clive was none\nother than the director of Naranja Academy...[VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0115_nelke_07b	In truth, the boy you knew as Clive was none\nother than the director of Uva Academy...[VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0115_nelke_08	Mr. Clavell![VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0115_select_03	N-no way!
team_0115_select_04	I already knew that
team_0115_nelke_09a	Yes, this must be quite the shock! My disguise\nwas perfect, after all.[VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0115_nelke_09b	What?! But my disguise was perfect!\c\nAlthough, now that I think about it...I did neglect\nto keep up my youthful act on a few occasions.\r\nThat must have been what gave me away.[VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0115_nelke_10	Regardless, there is still one more astonishing\ntruth I must reveal to you.[VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0115_nelke_11	The true identity of Cassiopeia, the big boss of\nTeam Star...was ME all along!!![VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0115_select_05	For real?!
team_0115_select_06	That’s impossible
team_0115_nelke_12	Honest to goodness![VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0115_nelke_13	When you heard Cassiopeia over the phone,\nthat was actually a prerecorded voice.\c\nI pulled it off using, er...you know, one of those...\nhigh-tech gizmos! Oh yes, it was very clever![VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0115_nelke_14	[VAR BD06(0000)]So, M[VAR 1100(00FF,0305)]asteriss [VAR 0100(0000)]! Now\nyou\r\nknow\r\nI’m\r\nthe\r\nbig\r\nboss!\r\nThat\r\nmeans\r\nthere\r\nis\r\njust\r\none\r\nthing\r\nleft\r\nto do![VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0115_nelke_15	Face me in one final showdown to decide it all![VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0115_nelke_16	Well now, M[VAR 1100(00FF,0305)]asteriss [VAR 0100(0000)]...[VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0115_nelke_17	It seems you have grown quite splendidly over\nthe course of your Treasure Hunt.[VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0115_nelke_18	And here, once again, I must apologize—[VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0115_nelke_19	I am not actually Cassiopeia.[VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0115_nelke_20	Though Clive and myself being the same person\nwas no lie, mind you...[VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0115_nelke_21	Cassiopeia’s true identity remains hidden.[VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0115_nelke_22	But I believe I can hazard a guess as to who\nthey may be.[VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0115_nelke_23	That is why I sought to spare you from having to\nconfront them in battle.[VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0115_nelke_24	Their sorrows...should not be yours to bear.[VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0115_nelke_25	However, Cassiopeia has settled on a course of\naction and is determined to see it through.[VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0115_nelke_26	I do not imagine any ordinary student could hope\nto stand against them and win.[VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0115_nelke_27	So, I challenged you to a battle to test your skill.[VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0115_nelke_28	If you had lost, it would have fallen to me to\nbring down Cassiopeia. Such was my resolve.[VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0115_nelke_29	But it turns out you are as strong as you are kind.\nIf anyone has a chance at saving that poor child,\r\nit is surely you.[VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0115_nelke_30	As an educator it shames me to burden one of\nmy students with such a task...[VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0115_nelke_31	But please...defeat Cassiopeia! Take on the big\nboss of Team Star and win![VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0115_select_07	Yes, sir!
team_0115_select_08	Leave it to me!
team_0115_nelke_32	Thank you, from the bottom of my heart. I leave\nthis in your hands.[VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0115_math_01	You there! What do you think you’re doing?![VAR 0114(0025)]
team_0115_nelke_33	Ah! Ms. Tyme, a pleasure to see you.[VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0115_math_02	It’s no pleasure at all, Mr. Clavell![VAR 0114(0025)]
team_0115_math_03	I come here to investigate reports of an illicit\nbattle on school grounds, and what do I find?[VAR 0114(0025)]
team_0115_math_04	Why, the director of the academy himself!\nFacing off against one of our students, no less!\r\nWhat were you thinking?![VAR 0114(0025)]
team_0115_nelke_34	Ah, no, if I could just explain. You see, it is a\nrather sad tale...[VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0115_math_05	Oh, spare me! Your excuses reek worse than a\nStunky’s behind![VAR 0114(0025)]
team_0115_nelke_35	A Stunky’s b-b-behind?[VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0115_nelke_36	Ahem![VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0115_nelke_37	Remember—the big boss asked us to meet them\nin the schoolyard after dark.[VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0115_nelke_38	[VAR BD06(0000)]I am counting on you, M[VAR 1100(00FF,0305)]asteriss\n[VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0115_math_06	You’ll write a letter of apology to the students\nand faculty at once!\c\nAnd I’ll be reporting this to the chairwoman of\nthe school board, make no mistake![VAR 0114(0025)]
team_0115_nelke_39	Good gracious, no! A-anything but that,\nI implore you...[VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0120.tbl
team_0120_cassiopeia_01	[VAR 0100(0000)]...[VAR 0114(0009)]
team_0120_cassiopeia_02	Thanks for coming.[VAR 0114(0009)]
team_0130.tbl
team_0130_cassiopeia_01	Heh. This must be quite a shock for you.[VAR 0114(0009)]
team_0130_cassiopeia_02	The big boss... Cassiopeia... They were both me\nall along.[VAR 0114(0009)]
team_0130_cassiopeia_03	When I saw you make quick work of those Team\nStar lackeys outside school that time, the idea\r\nfor Operation Starfall suddenly came to me.[VAR 0114(0009)]
team_0130_cassiopeia_04	My skills let me get hold of as much LP as I want,\nso I decided to use that to tempt you into\r\nhelping me out.[VAR 0114(0009)]
team_0130_cassiopeia_05	After the operation started, I kept an eye on you\nas a member of the “supply unit”...[VAR 0114(0009)]
team_0130_cassiopeia_06	And I had you battle the bosses on my behalf.\c\nAll for the goal of defeating me and putting an\nend to Team Star once and for all.[VAR 0114(0009)]
team_0130_cassiopeia_07	But still...there’s a part of me that wants Team\nStar to live on! I can’t just roll over and let you\r\nwin without putting up a fight![VAR 0114(0009)]
team_0130_cassiopeia_08	This is the final showdown. Are you ready?[VAR 0114(0009)]
team_0130_select_01	I’m ready
team_0130_select_02	Not just yet
team_0130_cassiopeia_09	All right. Get yourself sorted, then we’ll try\nthis again.[VAR 0114(0009)]
team_0130_cassiopeia_10	Thanks.[VAR 0114(0009)]
team_0130_nelke_01	Sorry to keep you.\c\nThe letter of apology Ms. Tyme had me— Errr...\nI mean, preparations took longer than expected.[VAR 0114(001E)]
team_0130_cassiopeia_11	That voice... Are you Clive?[VAR 0114(0009)]
team_0130_nelke_03	Penny. So it was you after— Ah. No, I mean...\nIs that you, Cassiopeia?[VAR 0114(001E)]
team_0130_cassiopeia_12	In the flesh. I’ve a task for you, Clive, if you’ll\naccept it.[VAR 0114(0009)]
team_0130_cassiopeia_13	I want you to record what happens next so I can\nsend the video to Team Star. They need to see\r\nthe outcome of this battle for themselves.[VAR 0114(0009)]
team_0130_nelke_04	O-OK... Will do.[VAR 0114(001E)]
team_0130_cassiopeia_14	Then allow me to introduce myself properly...[VAR 0114(0009)]
team_0130_cassiopeia_15	I’m the big boss of Team Star. The name’s\nCassiopeia—[VAR 0114(0009)]
team_0130_cassiopeia_16	No...Penny![VAR 0114(0008)]
team_0130_cassiopeia_17	Now, bow down before the overwhelming might\nof Team Star’s founder![VAR 0114(0008)]
team_0140.tbl
team_0140_cassiopeia_00	It’s finally over, guys... It’s done.[VAR 0114(0008)]
team_0140_cassiopeia_01	We’re done here. I think we should call it quits.[VAR 0114(0009)]
team_0140_akuboss_01	Hold up—are you sayin’ we should break up\nthe team...?\c\nYou gotta be joking![VAR 0114(0021)]
team_0140_cassiopeia_02	We got carried away with Operation Star...\nNow everything’s gotten out of hand.[VAR 0114(0009)]
team_0140_honooboss_01	Yeah, well, that’s what happens when you round\nup a buncha bullies in the courtyard and make a\r\nshow of learning ’em some manners.[VAR 0114(001F)]
team_0140_kakutouboss_01	But we didn’t even fight them in the end.\nWe didn’t do anything wrong![VAR 0114(0022)]
team_0140_dokuboss_01	Indeed. Merely did we declare our intention to\nbattle tooth and nail should the villains persist\r\nin their tyrannous oppression.\c\n’Twas a bloodless victory, we assure you![VAR 0114(0023)]
team_0140_fairyboss_01	Yeah! They didn’t even send out their Pokémon—\nthey just blubbered and apologized a whole lot...\r\nOur outfits must’ve spooked them good![VAR 0114(0020)]
team_0140_cassiopeia_03	But the bullies made a huge stink about what\nwent down, and then they all ended up leaving\r\nthe academy.\c\nOur plan backfired epically. There’s no way we’re\ngetting off scot-free.[VAR 0114(0009)]
team_0140_akuboss_02	I guess you’re right... This little stunt might’ve put\nus up the creek.[VAR 0114(0021)]
team_0140_cassiopeia_04	I’ll fix this mess on my end. Just leave it to me.[VAR 0114(0009)]
team_0140_honooboss_02	What’re you saying?[VAR 0114(001F)]
team_0140_cassiopeia_05	I’m the one who started Team Star. I dragged you\nall into this.[VAR 0114(0009)]
team_0140_cassiopeia_06	So I’ll take responsibility for everything.[VAR 0114(0009)]
team_0140_dokuboss_02	Oh, noble and kind big boss. You cannot...[VAR 0114(0023)]
team_0140_cassiopeia_07	Now that the bullies are gone, you guys should\nstart going to school again.[VAR 0114(0009)]
team_0140_honooboss_03	Oh yeah? And what about you?[VAR 0114(001F)]
team_0140_cassiopeia_08	I can’t go back...[VAR 0114(0009)]
team_0140_akuboss_03	Why? There’s no reason for you to stay shut in\nyour room anymore, right?[VAR 0114(0021)]
team_0140_cassiopeia_09	All I can say to you guys is...thanks.[VAR 0114(0009)]
team_0140_cassiopeia_10	Even though we never met in person, you were\nall so kind to me...[VAR 0114(0009)]
team_0140_kakutouboss_02	Stop right there, B.B.! Why are you talking like\nwe’ll never speak again?[VAR 0114(0022)]
team_0140_cassiopeia_11	I need to go take care of some things...[VAR 0114(0009)]
team_0140_dokuboss_03	Prithee, speak to us! What is thine intent?[VAR 0114(0023)]
team_0140_cassiopeia_12	... ... ...[VAR 0114(0009)]
team_0140_fairyboss_02	Hey, Big Boss! Answer us![VAR 0114(0020)]
team_0140_cassiopeia_13	Bye-bye, guys... Thanks for everything.[VAR 0114(0009)]
team_0150.tbl
team_0150_botan_01	[VAR BD06(0000)]Thanks for everything, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nAnd\r\nyou\r\ntoo, Clive...[VAR 0114(0008)]
team_0150_nelke_01	I’m glad I could see this through to the end.[VAR 0114(001E)]
team_0150_botan_02	I guess this is it for Team Star...and me, too—[VAR 0114(0008)]
team_0150_nelke_02	Hold that thought, Mis— Ah...Penny! I’d like to\ncheck something with you first.[VAR 0114(001E)]
team_0150_botan_03	Check...what?[VAR 0114(0008)]
team_0150_nelke_03	Why resort to something like Operation Starfall\nif you’re the big boss of Team Star?\c\nWasn’t there any other way to handle this?[VAR 0114(001E)]
team_0150_botan_04	I tried telling the bosses that we were done once\nbefore. But they still didn’t quit...[VAR 0114(0008)]
team_0150_nelke_04	Why not simply order them to?[VAR 0114(001E)]
team_0150_botan_05	Our code states that no one in the team has the\nright to order people around. I could ask them\r\nall to do stuff, but I could never order them.[VAR 0114(0008)]
team_0150_nelke_05	So, it’s back to the code once again... The bosses\nmust’ve taken it very seriously.[VAR 0114(001E)]
team_0150_botan_06	They did. That’s why I knew I could use it to force\nTeam Star to disband.[VAR 0114(0008)]
team_0150_nelke_06	Because the bosses would do anything the code\nrequired of them? Even leave the team?[VAR 0114(001E)]
team_0150_botan_07	Yes... And according to the code, they had to\naccept any challenge made to them.[VAR 0114(0008)]
team_0150_nelke_07	Thus the idea for Operation Starfall...[VAR 0114(001E)]
team_0150_nelke_08	Cassiopeia. Let me ask you one last thing.[VAR 0114(001E)]
team_0150_nelke_09	What does Team Star— No, what do your friends\nin the team mean to you?[VAR 0114(001E)]
team_0150_botan_08	... ... ...\nThey’re...[VAR 0114(0008)]
team_0150_botan_09	They’re my greatest treasure.[VAR 0114(0008)]
team_0150_nelke_10	Splendid. Thank you for apprising me of the\nsituation, Miss Penny.[VAR 0114(001E)]
team_0150_botan_10	Wha—?[VAR 0114(0008)]
team_0150_nelke_11	Now, young lady, there’s something I should very\nmuch like to discuss with you.[VAR 0114(001E)]
team_0150_botan_11	Hey, quit it with the old geezer act, Clive!\nYou’re creeping me out...[VAR 0114(0008)]
team_0150_nelke_12	...Indeed. Well then, before we talk further, allow\nme to reveal to you my own secret identity![VAR 0114(001E)]
team_0150_nelke_13	Ha-hah![VAR 0114(001E)]
team_0150_botan_12	D-Director Clavell?![VAR 0114(0008)]
team_0150_nelke_14	Just as Cassiopeia was your disguise, the boy\nyou knew as Clive was mine![VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0150_botan_13	But... But why?![VAR 0114(0008)]
team_0150_nelke_15	[~ 27]
team_0150_nelke_16	I needed a way to talk to Team Star on\nequal terms.[VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0150_nelke_17	Students do tend to shy from speaking their mind\nto their teachers, after all... Much more so when\r\nfaced with the director of the academy.[VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0150_botan_14	Yeah, but...where do I even start? Wasn’t the\noutfit a bit much?\c\nPlus I have some big feelings about that wig...[VAR 0114(0008)]
team_0150_nelke_18	Ahem! Well, that’s quite enough of that for now.\c\nEveryone! Why don’t you come on out?[VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0155.tbl
team_0155_botan_01	Huh?[VAR 0114(0008)]
team_0155_aku_01	Yo, Big Boss! Long time no see![VAR 0114(0021)]
team_0155_botan_02	Momo...[VAR 0114(0008)]
team_0155_honoo_01	More like “long time no meet,” right? I mean,\nwe only found out your real name just now![VAR 0114(001F)]
team_0155_botan_03	Mellie...[VAR 0114(0008)]
team_0155_doku_01	Verily is thy long-hidden countenance a sight for\nsore eyes, my lady.[VAR 0114(0023)]
team_0155_botan_04	Atticus...[VAR 0114(0008)]
team_0155_fairy_01	So, um, I heard your real name’s Penny?\nHow’ve you been this whole time?[VAR 0114(0020)]
team_0155_botan_05	Ortie...[VAR 0114(0008)]
team_0155_kakutou_01	We found you at last... You’ve no idea how\nworried we’ve been![VAR 0114(0022)]
team_0155_botan_06	Eri...[VAR 0114(0008)]
team_0155_aku_02	OK, gang, on the count of three! One, two...[VAR 0114(0021)]
team_0155_all_01	Hasta la vistar, Cassiopeia! ☆ And hello, Penny!
team_0160.tbl
team_0160_head_teacher_01	Now then, Miss Penny—and each of you young\nbosses, as well.[VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0160_head_teacher_02	On behalf of the academy, I have something I\nwould like to say to Team Star.[VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0160_head_teacher_03	You all have...my sincerest apologies.[VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0160_botan_01	...Come again?[VAR 0114(0008)]
team_0160_head_teacher_04	As director of the academy, I let you down. My\nhandling of your situation was a dismal failure...[VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0160_botan_02	Wha—? I still don’t... I mean... Why?[VAR 0114(0008)]
team_0160_head_teacher_05	You all told me about your reasons for forming\nTeam Star and about your subsequent actions.[VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0160_head_teacher_06	Ever since my first days as director, all I’ve ever\nexperienced of the academy is an environment\r\nblessedly free from bullying.[VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0160_head_teacher_07	But I now know this peace was built on the backs\nof your hurt and anger—and, of course, your\r\nimmense courage in putting things to right.[VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0160_head_teacher_08	And so, I’ll get straight to the conclusion.[VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0160_head_teacher_09	The academy’s order for Team Star to disband\nand my threat to expel those who did not obey...\r\nare hereby revoked![VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0160_aku_03	Does that mean what I think it means...?[VAR 0114(0021)]
team_0160_head_teacher_10	Indeed! Team Star can continue to exist, should\nthat be your wish![VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0160_kakutou_03	Woo-hoo! Penny, isn’t this great? Now we can all\nstay together![VAR 0114(0022)]
team_0160_doku_03	O, mine heart is giddy with glee![VAR 0114(0023)]
team_0160_botan_03	B-but...I betrayed all of you...[VAR 0114(0008)]
team_0160_fairy_01	You mean Operation Starfall? Director Clavell\ntold us all about it![VAR 0114(0020)]
team_0160_aku_01	Far as we heard, you only went through with it\nto save us from getting expelled!\c\nYou were just worried about us, right?[VAR 0114(0021)]
team_0160_honoo_01	Not like we’d ever chuck the team just ’cause\nsomeone told us to, after all. Ain’t our style.[VAR 0114(001F)]
team_0160_doku_01	I cannot even begin to imagine how you must\nhave fear’d for us, Lady Penny...[VAR 0114(0023)]
team_0160_kakutou_01	Sorry for making you worry, B.B. We’re all\nOK now.[VAR 0114(0022)]
team_0160_botan_04	But—! Even so...[VAR 0114(0008)]
team_0160_head_teacher_11	Hold on, everyone. I’ve more to say.[VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0160_head_teacher_12	As previously stated, the requirement for Team\nStar to disband has been revoked.[VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0160_head_teacher_13	However! There are still some unsettled matters\nto discuss. Allow me to provide a few examples...[VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0160_head_teacher_14	Your protracted truancy! Your brazen\ncustomization of school uniforms![VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0160_head_teacher_26	Your unauthorized usage of academy equipment![VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0160_head_teacher_27	Your reckless modification and jeopardous\ndriving of Pokémon-powered vehicles![VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0160_head_teacher_28	Need I go on? Your flagrant disregard for school\nrules cannot simply be overlooked![VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0160_head_teacher_15	Thus, as punishment, you will all be required to\nengage in community service.[VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0160_botan_05	Community...service?[VAR 0114(0008)]
team_0160_head_teacher_16	Yes. Specifically, I will be asking you to manage\nthe STCs.[VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0160_botan_06	Aaand that stands for...?[VAR 0114(0008)]
team_0160_head_teacher_17	The Star Training Centers![VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0160_head_teacher_18	They shall be facilities for cultivating Pokémon\nTrainers’ talents. I plan for the academy to found\r\nthem in collaboration with the Pokémon League.[VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0160_head_teacher_19	[VAR BD06(0000)]The idea came to me when I saw M[VAR 1100(00FF,0305)]asteriss\n[VAR 0100(0000)]\r\nbattling\r\nh[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]iser\r\nway\r\nthrough\r\nyour bases.[VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0160_head_teacher_20	The bases’ construction, as well as the battle\ntactics employed by the students in Team Star,\r\nare remarkably unique and creative![VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0160_head_teacher_21	I would ask that you continue your team activities\nbut henceforth as STC staff members, using your\r\nformer bases as training facilities.[VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0160_head_teacher_22	And that is the sum of it. Does anyone have\nany concerns?[VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0160_botan_07	Um...no? It sounds like fun, so I don’t see how\nthis’d be anything but a win-win...[VAR 0114(0008)]
team_0160_fairy_02	This may be a weird thing to say since the STCs\nare supposed to be a punishment and all, but\r\nyou should totally join in too, Penny![VAR 0114(0020)]
team_0160_doku_02	’Tis true... We would most happily have you at\nour sides, my lady.[VAR 0114(0023)]
team_0160_kakutou_02	We can go to school together too! That way if\nanything happens, we’ll be there to protect you![VAR 0114(0022)]
team_0160_aku_02	We were already talkin’ about how great it’d be\nto have both Team Star and school in our lives.\r\nThis’d be a sweet deal for us![VAR 0114(0021)]
team_0160_honoo_02	So, whaddya say...?[VAR 0114(001F)]
team_0160_botan_08	You guys...[VAR 0114(0008)]
team_0160_botan_09	[VAR 0100(0000)]...what do you think?[VAR 0114(0008)]
team_0160_select_01	I think it sounds great!
team_0160_select_02	Give it your best!
team_0160_botan_10	Huh? B-but—! Ummm... I just...[VAR 0114(0008)]
team_0160_head_teacher_23	No need to give your response right this moment,\nMiss Penny. Do take some time to decide.[VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0160_head_teacher_24	For now, at least, I think our little group should\ngo their separate ways.\c\nAh. Not to say you should break up Team Star\nafter all! I simply meant it is time to leave.[VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0160_head_teacher_25	[VAR BD06(0000)]M[VAR 1100(00FF,0305)]asteriss [VAR 0100(0000)]. Please stop\nby\r\nmy\r\noffice\r\nlater,\r\nif\r\nyou would.[VAR 0114(000A)]

team_0170_head_teacher_02	I wanted to thank you for all your hard work in\nresolving the situation with Team Star.[VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0170_head_teacher_03	If not for you, I suspect I would have done the\nteam a grievous injustice in my choice of\r\npunishment for their actions.[VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0170_head_teacher_04	You have my sincere gratitude.[VAR 0114(000A)]

team_0170_head_teacher_06	Ah, Miss Penny! Do come in.[VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0170_botan_00	H-hello, Director.[VAR 0114(0008)]
team_0170_botan_02	About the STCs... I’d like to work on them\ntogether with the rest of Team Star.[VAR 0114(0008)]
team_0170_head_teacher_07	That’s wonderful news. Thank you very much\nfor your favorable response.[VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0170_head_teacher_08	But, um...I...I should be punished more heavily\nthan the others, I think...[VAR 0114(0008)]
team_0170_head_teacher_09	Why so? Because of Operation Starfall?[VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0170_botan_03	No, not that. Because of the other really bad\nthing I did...[VAR 0114(0008)]
team_0170_head_teacher_10	And what would that be?[VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0170_botan_04	Um... Y’know the LP I gave you both in exchange\nfor helping me with Operation Starfall...?[VAR 0114(0008)]
team_0170_botan_05	I got hold of it sort of...illegally...by hacking the\nPokémon League’s LP management system.[VAR 0114(0008)]
team_0170_head_teacher_11	Ah. I see. That is...quite the revelation.[VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0170_head_teacher_12	I did not think such a thing was even possible\nin the first place.[VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0170_botan_06	It wasn’t all that har— Errr, I mean...I’m really\nsorry and I won’t do it again.[VAR 0114(0008)]
team_0170_head_teacher_13	Hmm. This matter is rather out of my jurisdiction,\nI’m afraid.[VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0170_head_teacher_15	I will have to consult Ms. Geeta, the Pokémon\nLeague chairwoman, on how best to proceed.[VAR 0114(000A)]
