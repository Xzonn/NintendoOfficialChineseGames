msg_ev000600_talk_17	What’s so strange about them, you ask?\c\nWell, each and every Pokémon is able to shrink\nitself down to minuscule size![VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_ev000600_talk_18	And that’s where Poké Balls come in!\c\nPoké Balls are a recent invention, you see.\nThrow one of them at a Pokémon, and...[VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_ev000600_talk_19	why, the Pokémon will shrink down and fit inside\nthe ball, comfy as can be. And with that, you’ve\r\ncaught a Pokémon![VAR 0114(0005)]

msg_ev000600_talk_21	Now, the proper technique is to take aim at the\nPokémon, then let the ball fly—it’s quite simple!\c\nThough far be it from me to say so, I suppose,\ngiven my own dire lack of skill in this area.[VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_ev000600_talk_80	I’m sure you have many questions after your fall\nfrom the sky, but let’s go one step at a time, eh?\c\nBesides, catching those Pokémon is to their\nbenefit, too![VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_ev000600_talk_81	Wait! Please, don’t go. I need you to catch my\nrunaway Pokémon![VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_ev000600_talk_82	Did...did you just try to throw a Poké Ball at me?\nI’d really rather you not![VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_ev000600_talk_83	Now now, please aim carefully before throwing!\nThese Poké Balls are quite valuable, you know.[VAR 0114(0005)]

msg_ev001200_talk_02	And as I mentioned, they bolted from the village\nalmost as if they knew you’d come falling...[VAR 0114(0005)]

msg_ev001225_talk_02	This road we’re on now is known to the locals as\nCanala Avenue.[VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_ev001225_talk_04	The village was built scarcely two years ago...\nThere’s much to do yet and not many to do it.[VAR 0114(0005)]

msg_ev010000_talk_04	Hm. For you to get in here, someone must’ve\nvouched for you...[VAR 0114(0004)]
msg_ev010000_talk_04_m	If the guard let you through, you must have ties\nwith somebody in the village...[VAR 0114(0004)]
msg_ev010000_talk_05	Was it Professor Laventon? Do you two know\neach other? He’s from a region a long way off.\c\nNot the most reliable sort, though—letting\nPokémon run off and give him the slip and all...[VAR 0114(0004)]
msg_ev010000_talk_06	Three more of ’em got away just a while ago!\c\nIf I hadn’t been resting up after some Pokémon\ndrubbed me with a move called Thunder Shock,\r\nI’d have corralled ’em for sure.\c\nBut the professor, well...[VAR 0114(0004)]

msg_ev010000_talk_06_m	I suppose I’m hardly one to talk—I’ve had some\ntrouble with Pokémon myself.\c\nI was hit by a Pokémon move called Thunder\nShock not long ago and had to take to my bed.\c\nBut the professor...well... I do wonder how long\nhe’ll last.[VAR 0114(0004)]
msg_ev010000_talk_07_m	Unfortunately it’s just as Akari says... I’m a clumsy\nsort of fellow, to put it mildly![VAR 0114(0005)]

msg_ev010000_talk_12_m	Captain Cyllene?![VAR 0114(0007)]
msg_ev010000_talk_13	I am the captain of the Galaxy Team’s Survey\nCorps. You may call me Cyllene.[VAR 0114(0008)]
msg_ev010000_talk_14	Professor Laventon has told me how you helped\nsecure his Pokémon when they slipped his control.\c\nAnd now it seems he would like us to feed and\nhouse you in exchange for your ongoing labor.[VAR 0114(0008)]
msg_ev010000_talk_15	Hmm. You look to be 15 or so.[VAR 0114(0008)]
msg_ev010000_talk_16	Quite old enough to work for your keep.\c\nBut we can’t simply take on a stranger who\nwanders in among us, without any idea of their\r\nskills or origins.[VAR 0114(0008)]
msg_ev010000_talk_17	Tomorrow we shall see if you can prove\nyourself worthy.[VAR 0114(0008)]
msg_ev010000_talk_18	Oho! A most reasonable decision, Captain.\c\nNow, would you care to join us for a meal?\nI’m sure you’ve got plenty of questions for\r\nour visitor![VAR 0114(0005)]

msg_ev010000_talk_21	Well, no matter! The rest of us can share a meal\nand some pleasant conversation, then, eh?[VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_ev010000_talk_22	Beni, old chum! The usual potato mochi, if you\nplease—but make it for three today![VAR 0114(0005)]

msg_ev010010_talk_02_m	Professor Laventon, where exactly did you meet\nour...visitor here?[VAR 0114(0007)]
msg_ev010010_talk_03	Ah, well, you know of that great hole in the sky?\nThe one people call the space-time rift?\r\nOur new friend fell right out of it![VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_ev010010_talk_04	...Was that a joke?[VAR 0114(0006)]

msg_ev010010_talk_07	Sure, they’re all over the place. In the grass, in\nthe forests, in the ocean...\c\nIt’s up to us in the Survey Corps to study them\nand figure out what kind of creatures they are.[VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev010010_talk_07_m	That there are—in the grass, in forests, by water,\nor wherever they like.\c\nOur job as the Survey Corps is to research them\nand find out what kind of creatures they are![VAR 0114(0007)]
msg_ev010010_talk_08	Well, we know this much...\c\nPokémon are terrifying creatures![VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_ev010010_talk_09	It’s all but impossible to know what kinds of\npowers they might possess or what sorts of\r\nwondrous things they can do![VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_ev010010_talk_10	[VAR BD06(0000)]But that’s where [VAR 0100(0000)] will\ncome in![VAR 0114(0005)]

msg_ev010010_talk_12	That’s really something. We count ourselves lucky\nwhen we manage to catch a single wild Pokémon\r\nwhile fending off their attacks...[VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev010010_talk_12_m	Three?! We have a hard enough time catching\neven one when wild Pokémon come after us...[VAR 0114(0007)]
msg_ev010010_talk_13	Ah, well, to be perfectly fair, the Pokémon that\nfled to the beach weren’t on the attack.\c\nBut the key to catching Pokémon is getting close\nenough to aim your Poké Ball well. And it seems\r\nour new friend is fearless enough to do just that![VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_ev010010_talk_14	Does the Survey Corps really have the leeway\nto be enjoying a leisurely meal with this outsider?[VAR 0114(000E)]
msg_ev010010_talk_16	Your captain just ordered 10 whole portions of\npotato mochi, you know. The slow progress on\r\nthat Pokédex of yours clearly has her on edge.[VAR 0114(000E)]

msg_evchap01_null_12	[~ 113]
msg_ev012010_talk_01	Let us get straight to it.[VAR 0114(0008)]
msg_ev012010_talk_02	If you wish to join the Galaxy Expedition Team,\nprove yourself capable by going out into the\r\nObsidian Fieldlands and catching three different\r\nspecies of Pokémon: Bidoof, Starly, and Shinx.[VAR 0114(0008)]
msg_ev012010_talk_03	Three species, right away?! But none of us have\never managed that![VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev012010_talk_03_m	Catching three Pokémon from the start? No one\nin the Galaxy Team has ever managed that...[VAR 0114(0007)]
msg_ev012010_talk_04	Did this stranger not catch three different\nPokémon only yesterday?\c\nMy trial should be simple enough for h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer—if the\nprofessor wasn’t exaggerating things, that is.[VAR 0114(0008)]
msg_ev012010_talk_05	The Galaxy Team does not have the means to\nprovide for those who only take without giving.\c\nIf you wish to stay, you must prove beyond any\ndoubt that you’ll be an asset to our cause.[VAR 0114(0008)]
msg_ev012010_talk_08	I will lend you one of our Survey Corps satchels\nto carry whatever you may need in the field.[VAR 0114(0008)]
msg_ev012010_talk_09	That whatever-it-is you’re wearing doesn’t suit\nour satchels in the least![VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev012010_talk_09_m	That satchel doesn’t exactly match your, er,\nmode of dress...[VAR 0114(0007)]
msg_ev012010_talk_06	Rei.\c\nI’ll expect you to step in if anything goes awry.[VAR 0114(0008)]
msg_ev012010_talk_06_m	Akari.\c\nI’ll expect you to step in if anything goes awry.[VAR 0114(0008)]
msg_ev012010_talk_07	[VAR BD06(0000)]Pardon, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Come with\nme a moment![VAR 0114(0005)]

msg_ev012020_talk_01	Now then, a jolly good morning to everyone![VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_ev012020_talk_02	What did you need, Professor?[VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev012020_talk_02_m	Is something the matter, Professor Laventon?[VAR 0114(0007)]
msg_ev012020_talk_03	[VAR BD06(0000)]In order to complete our Pokédex and, well,\nsimply survive in this unforgiving land...\c\n[VAR 0100(0000)] absolutely must pass\nthis trial![VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_ev012020_talk_04	And as a professor of Pokémon, I’ve got just the\nticket to help accomplish that![VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_ev012020_talk_05	Krooo!
msg_ev012020_talk_06	Fooom!
msg_ev012020_talk_07	Plish plash!
msg_ev012020_talk_08	[VAR BD06(0000)]Go on, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Pick the\nPokémon\r\nthat\r\nstrikes\r\nyour fancy!\c\nWith a partner of your own, you’ll be able to\nfight off wild Pokémon outside the village![VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_ev012020_talk_09	These little darlings are very dear to me...but it’s\nplain to see they’re rather curious about you![VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_ev012020_talk_10	Well, my [VAR 1100(00FF,0403)]boygirl? Which Pokémon would you like to\nkeep as your very own?[VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_evchap01_null_24	[~ 138]
msg_ev012200_talk_01	Krooo!
msg_ev012210_talk_01	Fooom!
msg_ev012220_talk_01	Plish plash!
msg_ev012200_talk_02	[VAR BD06(0000)]Do you want [VAR 0101(0001)] as your\nfirst partner?[VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_ev012200_talk_80	Why not just choose whichever one your gut tells\nyou to?[VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev012200_talk_80_m	They’re all so lovely...[VAR 0114(0007)]
msg_ev012200_talk_81	You know what is expected of you. Now it is up\nto you to see things through.[VAR 0114(0008)]
msg_evchap01_null_34	[~ 146]
msg_ev012230_talk_01	[VAR BD06(0000)]And with that, one of the Pokémon you caught at\nPrelude Beach for me will now be yours to keep!\c\nGood show! I’ve tucked [VAR 0101(0001)] back\ninside\r\nits\r\nPoké Ball for you, so take it—it’s yours![VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_ev012230_talk_02	A word of advice, my [VAR 1100(00FF,0403)]boygirl—pay close attention\nto which Poké Balls are empty and which ones\r\ncontain a Pokémon when you’re out in the field![VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_ev012230_talk_08	Kooo kooo!
msg_ev012230_talk_09	Fooom!
msg_ev012230_talk_10	Plashhh!
msg_ev012230_talk_11	[VAR BD06(0000)]Look at those two cheer on their\npal [VAR 0101(0001)].[VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev012230_talk_12	[VAR BD06(0000)]Or maybe they just wanted to help\n[VAR 0100(0000)]\r\nwith\r\nher trial![VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev012230_talk_11_m	They look as if they’re cheering on their\nfriend [VAR 0101(0001)].[VAR 0114(0007)]
msg_ev012230_talk_12_m	Or perhaps they’re jealous that it gets to help\nyou with your trial![VAR 0114(0007)]
msg_ev012230_talk_13	[VAR BD06(0000)]That could well be... They did go dashing from\nthe village when [VAR 0100(0000)] fell\r\nout\r\nof\r\nthe\r\nsky,\r\nafter all.\c\nWell, not to worry, you two! I’ll have you assist\nme with my research for now![VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_ev012230_talk_14	Krooo.
msg_ev012230_talk_15	Fooom.
msg_ev012230_talk_16	Plish plash.
msg_ev012230_talk_19	By the by, what species has Captain Cyllene\ncharged you with catching?[VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_ev012230_talk_20	Well, that’s smashing! All three of those species\ncan be found in the Obsidian Fieldlands![VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_ev012230_talk_21	Let me give you some Poké Balls to use during\nyour trial, then.[VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_ev012230_talk_22	These Poké Balls may be handcrafted, but they\nwork a treat, as you’ve already seen![VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_ev012230_talk_23	You’ll have this trial cleared in no time![VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_ev012230_talk_18	Let’s be off!\c\nI’ll show you the way to the Obsidian Fieldlands.\nMeet me at the gate to your left as you\r\nleave headquarters.[VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev012230_talk_18_m	I guess you’re finally ready!\c\nYou’ll have to leave the village for your trial.\nTurn left after you exit headquarters, then head\r\nfor the gate.[VAR 0114(0007)]
msg_evchap01_null_14	[~ 167]
msg_ev012600_talk_01	Oh? What a curious getup you have there.\nI can already tell you’re quite the character![VAR 0114(0004)]
msg_ev012600_talk_02	I’m Volo of the Ginkgo Guild, the go-to choice\nfor any of your mercantile needs here in Hisui![VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev012600_talk_03	I’ve heard talk about you. Fell from the sky,\ndidn’t you? Now that’s certainly a tale I’d like\r\nto hear...[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev012600_talk_04	Oh, and you’ve a Pokémon!\nYou’re certainly full of interesting surprises...[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev012600_talk_05	Investigating the odd and novel is key to any\ngood merchant’s success! So what do you say?\c\nHow about you and I see how our Pokémon\nstand up to one another in battle?[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev012600_list_01	Sounds good
msg_ev012600_list_02	Maybe not...
msg_ev012600_talk_06	I like you better and better! What a delightful\nfind![VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev012600_talk_07	But what’s the point of having a Pokémon, then?\nCome on, now—it’s just a friendly competition![VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev012600_talk_08	I’ve also heard about this trial you’re to attempt.\c\nLet’s have a quick battle to get your blood\npumping before you head out!\c\nThough I hope you know you’ll lose if your\nPokémon’s HP reaches zero![VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_evchap01_null_38	[~ 178]
msg_ev012610_talk_01	It’s always good fun to have your Pokémon do\nbattle, don’t you think?\c\nAnd as they gain experience through battle,\nthey’ll learn more moves and grow even stronger![VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev012610_talk_09	But so few people here have their own Pokémon.\nIf only more knew how to use Poké Balls![VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev012610_talk_02	At any rate, let me help our two battlers recover\nfrom their little exercise.[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev012610_talk_03	And to you, my sky-fallen friend...I present some\nPotions in thanks![VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev012610_talk_04	You can use them on your Pokémon whenever\nthey might be worn out from battle.\c\nI’ll be hoping that you’re successful on that trial\nof yours.\c\nMore Galaxy Team members means more\ncustomers for yours truly, after all![VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev012610_talk_05	If you can battle that well, I’ve got a feeling you\nmay have your trial well in hand—even if it’s\r\nmore to do with catching than battling.[VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev012610_talk_05_m	That’s really something! Not only can you catch\nPokémon—you can lead them in battle![VAR 0114(0007)]
msg_ev012610_talk_06	Now, to the Obsidian Fieldlands![VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev012610_talk_06_m	Now, to the Obsidian Fieldlands![VAR 0114(0007)]
msg_ev012610_talk_07	Whenever you leave Jubilife Village, you have to\npick a destination from your map and let Ress the\r\nguardsman know where you’re off to.[VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev012610_talk_08	That way, someone can come collect you if things\ngo wrong.[VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev012610_talk_80	Hey...I hope you make it through this![VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev012610_talk_07_m	When you’re leaving Jubilife Village, make sure\nyou choose a destination from your map and tell\r\nRess the guardsman where you’re going.[VAR 0114(0007)]
msg_ev012610_talk_08_m	That way, someone can come to your aid if\nyou’re knocked out by a Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0007)]
msg_ev012610_talk_80_m	Your trial begins just a short way past that\nfront gate![VAR 0114(0007)]
msg_evchap01_null_36	[~ 194]
msg_ev012800_talk_01	[VAR BD06(0000)]You’re [VAR 0100(0000)], correct? I was\ninformed\r\nyou’d\r\nbe\r\npassing through.[VAR 0114(0030)]

msg_evchap01_null_26	[~ 197]
msg_ev012810_talk_01	This is our base camp. It’s where we start and\nfinish our surveys.[VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev012810_talk_02	Now remember what you’ve got to do.\c\nYou’ve been tasked with catching three species\nof Pokémon: Bidoof, Starly, and Shinx![VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev012810_talk_03	I’m curious to see if the professor’s stories about\nyou are really true.[VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev012810_talk_04	Oh, Professor? Something wrong?[VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev012810_talk_01_m	This is our base camp—the last safe haven before\nyou reach the wilds.[VAR 0114(0007)]
msg_ev012810_talk_02_m	For your trial, you must catch three species of\nPokémon: Bidoof, Starly, and Shinx![VAR 0114(0007)]
msg_ev012810_talk_03_m	Are you ready to get started?[VAR 0114(0007)]
msg_ev012810_talk_04_m	Oh, Professor? Is something wrong?[VAR 0114(0007)]
msg_ev012810_talk_05	Ah, well, you see...\c\nCaptain Cyllene got hold of me after you left...\c\nShe impressed upon me that I bear full\nresponsibility for whatever happens to\r\n“our sudden guest.”[VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_ev012810_talk_06	She doesn’t let up. How exactly are you\nsupposed to help out here, Professor?[VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev012810_talk_06_m	That’s our unsparing captain. But what help\nexactly can you offer out here, Professor?[VAR 0114(0007)]
msg_ev012810_talk_07	[VAR BD06(0000)]To be honest, my dear [VAR 1100(00FF,0304)]girlboy, I don’t intend to lift\na finger! [VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]’s talents are\r\nthe\r\nreal deal.\r\n[VAR 1100(00FF,0201)]HShe’ll pass with flying colors—you’ll see![VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_ev012810_talk_08	So in other words, I’m still the one bearing the\nresponsibility here? Not my ideal state of affairs.[VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev012810_talk_09	Let’s just get started. You’ll be more than equal\nto this, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev012810_talk_08_m	Ah. So the responsibility for him still lies, in fact,\nwith me, then.[VAR 0114(0007)]
msg_ev012810_talk_09_m	[VAR BD06(0000)]Well, I’m sure [VAR 0100(0000)] will be\nfine.\r\nLet’s\r\nbegin\r\nthe trial![VAR 0114(0007)]
msg_evchap01_null_27	[~ 214]
msg_ev012900_talk_80	Where are you even going?[VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev012900_talk_80_m	Are you sure you know where you’re going?[VAR 0114(0007)]
msg_evchap01_null_28	[~ 217]
msg_ev013000_talk_01	This is Aspiration Hill.[VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev013000_talk_02	Look—a Bidoof! We’re finding the Pokémon you\nneed already![VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev013000_talk_03	You may be some sort of prodigy, but just in\ncase, here’s what Captain Cyllene taught me...[VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev013000_talk_04	Bidoof is a mellow Pokémon, which means it\ndoesn’t tend to run away when you approach.\c\nAim carefully, let your Poké Ball fly, and you\nought to be all right.[VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev013000_talk_05	If you want to pass this trial, you’ll have to start\nby throwing a Poké Ball at a Bidoof![VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev013000_talk_06	What good is it to defeat the Bidoof? You’re\nmeant to catch it![VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev013000_talk_07	Hey! Wherever you’re trying to go, it can wait till\nyou’ve got a Bidoof![VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev013000_talk_01_m	This is Aspiration Hill. The species of Pokémon\nyou’re meant to catch all live here.[VAR 0114(0007)]
msg_ev013000_talk_02_m	And along comes a Bidoof! Time to get ready to\ncatch it.[VAR 0114(0007)]
msg_ev013000_talk_03_m	The key is to aim carefully. Not that you seem to\nneed my advice—I’m just sharing what I know.[VAR 0114(0007)]
msg_ev013000_talk_04_m	Bidoof has a mellow disposition. That means it\ntends not to run from people, so this’ll be easy![VAR 0114(0007)]
msg_ev013000_talk_05_m	You ought to be able to catch a Bidoof with a\nwell-thrown Poké Ball.[VAR 0114(0007)]
msg_ev013000_talk_06_m	I think you were tasked with catching a Bidoof,\nnot defeating it...[VAR 0114(0007)]
msg_ev013000_talk_07_m	Excuse me! You’ve a Bidoof to catch![VAR 0114(0007)]
msg_ev013000_talk_80	You’re out of Poké Balls? Come on—aim before\nyou throw![VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev013000_talk_80_m	Run dry of Poké Balls? Here, I’ve got some extra.\nGood luck![VAR 0114(0007)]
msg_ev013000_talk_81	If Pokémon start launching attacks at you, run to\nsafety as quickly as you can, all right, my [VAR 1100(00FF,0403)]boygirl?[VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_ev013000_talk_90	The point of your trial’s to catch ’em, remember?\nDon’t get too caught up with battling ’em.[VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev013000_talk_90_m	Don’t forget that your objective is to catch them.\nLosing battles to them won’t get you anywhere.[VAR 0114(0007)]
msg_evchap01_null_37	[~ 237]
msg_ev013010_talk_01	One Bidoof—caught! Now, on we march![VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev013010_talk_01_m	You caught a Bidoof! Well done! Time to find\nyour next Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0007)]
msg_evchap01_null_31	[~ 240]
msg_ev013050_talk_01	Now, Starly here—it’s the type to run at the drop\nof a hat.[VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev013050_talk_02	But not to worry! Crouch down in the grass, and\nit won’t spot you. That’s how you can get close![VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev013050_talk_03	That’s a shame... The Starly got away from\nyou, eh?\c\nThey’re quite skittish. It’s hard to catch one once\nit’s spotted you.[VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev013050_talk_04	Look, another Starly! You’ll need to crouch so it\ndoesn’t notice you.[VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev013050_talk_05	Crouching makes it harder for wild Pokémon to\nnotice you, even out in the open![VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev013050_talk_06	This is supposed to be a trial to CATCH a Starly,\nyou know.[VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev013050_talk_07	Hey! Wherever you’re trying to go, it can wait till\nyou’ve got a Starly![VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev013050_talk_01_m	There’s a Starly. They’re skittish little things—\nthey’ll run if startled.[VAR 0114(0007)]
msg_ev013050_talk_02_m	But you should be able to get close to them if\nyou crouch—you’ll be harder to spot![VAR 0114(0007)]
msg_ev013050_talk_03_m	Well, that’s a shame. Wave good-bye to that\nStarly, I suppose.\c\nAs I said, they’re skittish. If one spots you, you’ll\nhave a tough time catching it.[VAR 0114(0007)]
msg_ev013050_talk_04_m	Look! Another Starly. Crouch down before it\nspots you![VAR 0114(0007)]
msg_ev013050_talk_05_m	Crouching makes it harder for wild Pokémon\nto spot you, even outside tall grass.[VAR 0114(0007)]
msg_ev013050_talk_06_m	I think you were tasked with catching Starly, not\nbattling it...[VAR 0114(0007)]
msg_ev013050_talk_07_m	Excuse me—you’ve a Starly to catch...[VAR 0114(0007)]
msg_evchap01_null_39	[~ 255]
msg_ev013060_talk_01	And that’s Starly caught, too! I admit, I’m\nimpressed so far.[VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev013060_talk_01_m	That’s Starly caught as well! Only one more\nPokémon to go.[VAR 0114(0007)]
msg_evchap01_null_29	[~ 258]
msg_ev013070_talk_01	I forgot to share another smidgen of wisdom...[VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev013070_talk_02	How to throw your partner’s Poké Ball![VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev013070_talk_03	To quote Captain Cyllene’s wise teachings...\c\n“Have an item at the ready but want to send out\na Pokémon? Press X.”\c\n“Have a Pokémon at the ready but want to throw\nan item? Press X.”\c\nThe captain’s a real expert on these things.[VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev013070_talk_04	Then once you’ve got a Pokémon ready, try\naiming for certain rocks—or trees like this one.\c\nYour Pokémon will hunt for Berries and things,\nand it’ll bring back whatever it finds![VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev013070_talk_05	Now it’s time for your partner[VAR 1101(00FD,0100)]s to shine.\c\nWe’ve reached your final hurdle: catching\na Shinx.[VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev013070_talk_01_m	I forgot—there’s something I ought to teach you,\nsince you’re still new to this![VAR 0114(0007)]
msg_ev013070_talk_02_m	Here’s the proper way to throw your partner’s\nPoké Ball.[VAR 0114(0007)]

msg_evchap01_null_30	[~ 269]
msg_ev013090_talk_01	There it is. Shinx.[VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev013090_talk_02	Shinx has an aggressive disposition... Did you\nknow that already?[VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev013090_list_01	Yep!
msg_ev013090_list_02	It has what?
msg_ev013090_talk_03	That figures! Me, I have to focus on a Pokémon\ncarefully to notice a thing like that.[VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev013090_talk_04	Don’t worry about it! Just focus on the Pokémon\naround you—you’ll figure it out quick enough.[VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev013090_talk_05	Once aggressive Pokémon get wound up, they’ll\nknock away any balls you throw.[VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev013090_talk_06	But not to worry! I’ll teach you the trick to\ncatching them.[VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev013090_talk_07	You draw them into battle!\c\nOnce it’s caught up in the heat of battle, you can\nthrow a Poké Ball to try and catch it![VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev013090_talk_08	You’ve got a few Pokémon of your own to use\nnow, don’t you?[VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev013090_talk_09	Take one of their Poké Balls, and throw it at a\nwild Pokémon you want to battle![VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev013090_talk_10	Use what you learned in your battle with Volo!\nGet out there, and make your last catch![VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev013090_talk_11	Don’t get so caught up in battle yourself that you\nforget to throw a Poké Ball and catch it![VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev013090_talk_12	You can’t knock the Shinx out if you want to\ncatch it.\c\nEven in battle, catching works the same—choose\nan empty Poké Ball from your satchel and throw![VAR 0114(0006)]

msg_ev013090_talk_03_m	I thought you might! I can never tell until I focus\non a Pokémon carefully.[VAR 0114(0007)]
msg_ev013090_talk_04_m	Not to worry! These things become clear once\nyou focus on the Pokémon around you.[VAR 0114(0007)]
msg_ev013090_talk_05_m	Once aggressive Pokémon get irate, they’ll knock\naside any ball you throw at them.[VAR 0114(0007)]
msg_ev013090_talk_06_m	Don’t worry, though! I’ll teach you the trick to\ncatching aggressive Pokémon![VAR 0114(0007)]

msg_ev013090_talk_13_m	What? No, don’t leave! You have to catch\na Shinx![VAR 0114(0007)]
msg_ev013090_talk_14	I know you want to weaken Shinx to catch it, but\ngetting your partner knocked out won’t help![VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev013090_talk_14_m	You’re on the right track, using your partner’s\nmoves to weaken Shinx before catching it...but\r\nyou mustn’t let your Pokémon get knocked out![VAR 0114(0007)]

msg_ev019151_talk_05_m	G-guess I was wrong, then.\c\nBut I’ll strive to work more as a team with my\npartner, the way you do...[VAR 0114(0007)]
msg_ev019151_talk_06_m	Assuming Pikachu and I can...bridge some gaps.[VAR 0114(0007)]
msg_ev019151_talk_07_m	Oh, by the way—the professor said Pokémon\nhave things called “types,” which apparently\r\nmake a big difference in how battles go!\c\nPikachu seems to be an Electric type,\nfor example.[VAR 0114(0007)]
msg_ev019151_talk_08	So you’re the one? That new recruit everyone’s\ntalking about?[VAR 0114(0004)]
msg_ev019151_talk_09	The name’s Zisu. Captain of the Security Corps.[VAR 0114(001B)]
msg_ev019151_talk_10	I see you’ve got some fight in you. Figured I’d\nstop by and give what advice I could.[VAR 0114(001B)]
msg_ev019151_talk_11	Captain Zisu’s a master of an ancient martial art\nwhere you guide Pokémon in battle.[VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev019151_talk_11_m	Captain Zisu is a master of an ancient martial\nart—one that specializes in Pokémon battles.[VAR 0114(0007)]
msg_ev019151_talk_12	Now listen—if your Pokémon’s truly mastered its\nmoves, it can actually use them in different styles![VAR 0114(001B)]
msg_ev019151_talk_13	On the one hand, you can choose to deliver a\nmove in the [VAR FF00(0006)]strong style[VAR FF00(0000)].\c\nThe move will deal more damage, but afterward\nit’ll take longer for your Pokémon to act.[VAR 0114(001B)]
msg_ev019151_talk_14	On the other hand, you can choose to unleash\na move in the [VAR FF00(0006)]agile style[VAR FF00(0000)].\c\nSuch a move will have less power behind it, but\nyour Pokémon can act more quickly afterward.\c\nIn truly favorable conditions, it might even get\nout two moves before the opponent can act.[VAR 0114(001B)]
msg_ev019151_talk_15	Strong style moves, agile style moves, and of\ncourse, regular moves... Choose which is right for\r\na given situation, and direct your Pokémon with a\r\nlittle nudge.[VAR 0114(001B)]
msg_ev019151_talk_16	Oh, one more thing—if you want to teach your\nPokémon some powerful moves, just let me know![VAR 0114(001B)]
msg_ev019151_talk_17	Well, that’s certainly handy to find out about\nbefore going to tackle Mai’s request![VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev019151_talk_17_m	Zisu’s teachings should serve you well when\nyou’re up against tough Pokémon!\c\nNow I suppose it’s time I went to meet Mai.[VAR 0114(0007)]
msg_ev019151_talk_18	You remember? I mentioned it earlier. I’m\nheading down now to see about Mai’s request.[VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev019151_talk_19	I’m supposed to meet her down past the foot\nof Aspiration Hill. You should come along, too!\r\nGet ready, then meet us down there, would you?\c\nAnd by “ready,” I mean double-checking what\nPokémon you’ll bring...and maybe even teaching\r\nthem some new moves from Zisu![VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev019151_talk_18_m	You remember? I mentioned at the Wallflower\nthat I could use your help with Mai’s request.[VAR 0114(0007)]
msg_ev019151_talk_19_m	I’m to meet her down past the foot of\nAspiration Hill.\c\nYou should come as well—once you’ve readied\nyour Pokémon team and perhaps had them learn\r\nsome new moves from Zisu, if you’d like![VAR 0114(0007)]

msg_ev019170_talk_03	There’s a secret technique to catching Pokémon,\nyou see.[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev019170_talk_04	It’s what I call the Secret Back Strike Technique!\c\nHitting a Pokémon’s back with your Poké Ball will\nsurprise it, making it easier to catch or giving you\r\nan advantage once a battle starts![VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev019170_talk_05	If you’re part of the Survey Corps now, working\nto create that Pokédex as they all are, you might\r\nend up meeting every last Pokémon here in Hisui.[VAR 0114(000C)]

msg_ev019400_talk_03	My, my... A new face in the village?\c\nNot that it matters to me if you’re new. If you’re\nhere, I assume you’re prepared to be of help.[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_ev019400_talk_04	I am one of the wardens of the Diamond Clan.\nYou may call me Mai.[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_ev019400_talk_09	I suppose you might not even know what a\nwarden is, if you’re new to Hisui...[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_ev019400_talk_10	But such talk can wait. Right now, I’d rather we\nget straight to the point.\c\nI have a problem that I need help solving. So the\nmore important question is this...[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_ev019400_talk_05	Do you feel confident that you can lead your\nPokémon in battle?[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_ev019400_list_01	I do
msg_ev019400_list_02	Not really...
msg_ev019400_talk_06	That’s good to hear.\c\nThat Security Corps of yours certainly wasn’t\nup to the task.[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_ev019400_talk_12	This here is my partner, Munchlax. We were\nraised together like siblings.\c\nHe battles at my side by choice, without needing\nany silly little balls like you use. Watch and learn.[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_ev019400_talk_07	How uninspiring... Prepare yourself better, then\nrejoin us.[VAR 0114(000F)]

msg_ev020001_talk_03	Well fought, Munchlax.[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_ev020001_talk_12	I’ll take care of the Pokémon that battled for us.[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_ev020001_talk_13	And I’ll let you have these.\c\nYou people make all kinds of things with your\ncrafting, don’t you? These should prove to be\r\nuseful materials.[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_ev020001_talk_04	You and your Pokémon fought well together!\nYou practically acted as one with [VAR 1101(00FD,0402)]itthem.\c\nRather like the legendary hero of old... The one\nwe tell stories of to our children.[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_ev020001_talk_05	I think you’re indeed the one for the job.\c\nYou see, I need someone to deal with an alpha\nPokémon causing trouble upon Deertrack Heights.[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_ev020001_talk_06	It is a large, fearsome foe—like any alpha—but\nyou’ll come, won’t you?\c\nTo Deertrack Heights?[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_ev020001_sys_01	Your Arc Phone is beeping...
msg_ev020001_talk_07	Is that strange thingummy of yours telling you\nwhere to go?[VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev020001_talk_07_m	That thing you have... It’s showing you where\nyou’ve got to go, isn’t it?[VAR 0114(0007)]
msg_ev020001_talk_08	My, my, that is some curious sort of map.\c\nIs that one of those Galaxy Team inventions\nI keep hearing about?[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_ev020001_talk_09	It certainly does seem to show the way to\nDeertrack Heights, up ahead of us.[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_ev020001_talk_10	I’ll leave this bit to you! You shouldn’t have any\nproblem handling an alpha.[VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev020001_talk_10_m	I’ll leave this in your hands. You’ll do great out\nthere—I know it![VAR 0114(0007)]

msg_ev019000_talk_01	Time to go meet Mai![VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev019000_talk_02	She belongs to the Diamond Clan, like the\nprofessor mentioned.[VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev019000_talk_03	I’m told the Diamond Clan folk coexist with\nPokémon here in Hisui, working together with\r\nthem to survive.[VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev019000_talk_04	And don’t worry about her request—I doubt it’ll\nbe much trouble, knowing you. See you down\r\npast the foot of Aspiration Hill![VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev019000_talk_01_m	Good morning! Ready for another day on\nthe job?[VAR 0114(0007)]
msg_ev019000_talk_02_m	About the Diamond Clan, who Mai’s with—\nthey’re an assembly of people living here in\r\nHisui, with the help of Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0007)]
msg_ev019000_talk_03_m	It seems Mai’s got quite the favor to ask you,\nbut I think you’ll have it well in hand.\c\nYou’ll find us down past the foot of\nAspiration Hill![VAR 0114(0007)]
msg_chap02_null_09	[~ 24]
msg_ev019000_talk_05	We need to head to the Fieldlands Camp to\nmeet Mai, right? Don’t know why the professor\r\ndecided he should head over there too, but...[VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev019000_talk_04_m	I believe Mai will be waiting for us at the\nFieldlands Camp. The professor headed that\r\nway, too—though I couldn’t tell you why.[VAR 0114(0007)]
msg_chap02_null_11	[~ 27]
msg_ev020100_talk_02	Though...\c\nBefore we continue, I must ask. Do you already\nknow about almighty Sinnoh?[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_ev020100_list_01	Of course!
msg_ev020100_list_02	Almighty what, now?
msg_ev020100_talk_03	My, my. How about that.\c\nThough I’m not certain you’ve been told the true\nstory. The true story is this...[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_ev020100_talk_04	I suppose that’s to be expected. Allow me to\nsketch out the basics...[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_ev020100_talk_05	Almighty Sinnoh steers all time. It’s said to have\ncreated the very universe using its power over\r\ntime’s flow, and this land of Hisui was born in\r\nthe process.\c\nIt’s by the grace of almighty Sinnoh that Pokémon\ncan live and thrive here.[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_ev020100_talk_06	We of the Diamond Clan are descendants of a\npeople who crossed the sea and settled here in\r\nthe Hisui region to venerate almighty Sinnoh.[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_ev020100_talk_07	However, it stole away from the world long ago,\nhiding itself from our sight...\c\nAlmighty Sinnoh has only rarely been seen by\nany human, if the old tales are to be trusted.[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_ev020100_talk_08	But there are still Pokémon here today in Hisui\nwith a connection to almighty Sinnoh.\c\nAnd it is the duty of wardens like myself to\nattend to their needs.[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_ev020100_talk_09	The Pokémon that graces Deertrack Heights is\none of those honored few. It is directly\r\ndescended from a Pokémon that was blessed\r\nwith almighty Sinnoh’s protection.[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_ev020100_talk_10	Follow me, and you may understand.[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_chap02_null_46	[~ 39]
msg_ev022000_talk_01	Oh? So even your professor decided to join us?[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_ev022000_talk_11	Whew... Thank goodness... I got here in time...[VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_ev022000_talk_12	As a Pokémon researcher, I could hardly miss out\non a chance to observe an alpha, now, could I?[VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_ev022000_talk_02	I suppose that is your business... Fine—as long as\nyou stay out of the way.[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_ev022000_talk_03	This is Deertrack Heights...\c\nThis is where I’ve long come to pay tribute to a\nspecial Pokémon—a Pokémon descended from\r\none of those ancients blessed by almighty Sinnoh.[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_ev022000_talk_04	De-le-le wooooooooooop!
msg_ev022000_talk_05	That’s not it.\c\nThat’s only a troublemaker, here to disturb the\npeace with its racket.[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_ev022000_talk_06	[VAR BD06(0000)]And that’s what you’re here for,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]:\r\nto drive\r\nthat\r\ninterloper\r\nfrom\r\nthis place.\c\nI’ll ensure your Pokémon are ready for the battle.[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_ev022000_talk_07	Upon my word...what a large specimen!\c\nLittle wonder alpha Pokémon are feared across\nthe land if they’re all as oversized as this one![VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_ev022000_talk_08	Exactly. They’re not only big, though.\c\nThey are strong and may know moves that others\nof their kind do not.\c\nThey’re naught to be trifled with, let me tell you.\nNevertheless...[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_ev022000_talk_09	I believe you are stronger still than this alpha.\nSo go show it that, beyond any mistaking![VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_ev022000_talk_10	[VAR BD06(0000)]Be careful, [VAR 0100(0000)]. Size is a\npotent\r\nweapon\r\nin and\r\nof itself.\r\nNo doubt\r\nthis alpha\r\nis a\r\npowerful and\r\nhardy foe.\c\nIf you must face it, make sure your Pokémon\nha[VAR 1101(00FD,0201)]sve some strong moves at [VAR 1101(00FD,0503)]itstheir disposal.[VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_chap02_null_38	[~ 52]

msg_ev022210_talk_02	You really are an impressive one, aren’t you?\c\nSeeing someone best an alpha like that... It truly\nreminds me of the legendary hero of old![VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_ev022210_talk_13	We’d best make sure your Pokémon [VAR 1101(00FD,0302)]isare taken\ncare of after facing off against such a foe.[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_ev022210_talk_03	Wyeeeeeeer!

msg_ev022210_talk_07	[VAR BD06(0000)]He looks upon you with kindness,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]...[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_ev022210_talk_08	I’d say the great Wyrdeer has taken a liking to\nyou. That is fortunate.\c\nHe is an esteemed Pokémon that can dash across\nthe expanses of Hisui while bearing a human on\r\nhis back—a human he deems worthy, at least.\c\nHe is a blessing to us all.[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_ev022210_talk_09	Remarkable! Truly outstanding stuff! A Pokémon\nletting someone ride on it... Why, it’s just like the\r\nRide Pokémon of Alola![VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_ev022210_talk_10	Professor! I take it things went smoothly?[VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev022210_talk_11	[VAR BD06(0000)]I’m here on Captain Cyllene’s orders.\c\nShe said we’d be able to set up a base camp\nhere once [VAR 0100(0000)] took care of\r\nher request.[VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev022210_talk_10_m	Professor Laventon! [VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0007)]
msg_ev022210_talk_11_m	[VAR BD06(0000)]Captain Cyllene sent me.\c\nShe said that once [VAR 0100(0000)]\ncarried\r\nout\r\nthis\r\nrequest,\r\nwe’d\r\nbe\r\nable\r\nto\r\nset up\r\na base camp.[VAR 0114(0007)]
msg_ev022210_talk_16	Ah, about that. I know this was a joint decision by\nAdaman and the commander, but still—is it truly\r\nfine for us to set up more base camps like this?[VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_ev022210_talk_17	The Hisui region is a land created by almighty\nSinnoh for the sake of its Pokémon.\c\nAs long as your goal is to coexist and thrive\ntogether with the Pokémon, then I imagine you\r\nshould also be allowed to use this land.[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_ev022210_talk_18	[VAR BD06(0000)]The great Wyrdeer has taken a liking to\n[VAR 0100(0000)]\r\nas well.\r\nThis is a good sign.[VAR 0114(000F)]

msg_ev022210_talk_15	The Construction Corps should be here soon.\nThey’ll have our new base camp pitched in\r\nno time![VAR 0114(0006)]

msg_ev022220_talk_04	Well, that’s that. How about we head to the\nWallflower like usual?[VAR 0114(0006)]

msg_ev025000_talk_05	Excuse me? Are you really suggesting that you\nmake better use of your time than we make of\r\nvast Hisui’s space?[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev025000_talk_06	Better than some! It’s a miracle you showed up\non time, oh mighty leader of the Pearl Clan.\c\nI worried you’d get lost in the pointlessly vast\nspace you’re so fond of and never show up.[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev025000_talk_07	Me, get lost? In almighty Sinnoh’s great gift to\nthe Pearl Clan—in our world’s very basis?\r\nYou wish![VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev025000_talk_08	I wish that I hadn’t let myself get dragged into\narguing with you. Almighty Sinnoh forgive me—\r\nwhat a waste of time!\c\nI’m off to Commander Kamado’s office![VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev025000_talk_09	I believe it was you who started this![VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev025000_talk_10	Just another day with those two, I see.[VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev025000_talk_11	That man’s named Adaman. He’s the leader of\nthe Diamond Clan. They put a lot of importance\r\non time, as you could probably tell.[VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev025000_talk_12	And the girl is Irida, leader of the Pearl Clan.\nThey’re all about space—you heard what she\r\ncalled it, right? “Our world’s very basis.”[VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev025000_talk_13	Whenever they run into each other, those same\narguments flare up.\c\nSeems like they’ve inherited some bad blood\nfrom their predecessors’ strife.[VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev025000_talk_14	[VAR BD06(0000)]Ah well. Not our problem.\c\nBut you’ll have problems if you don’t get yourself\nto the commander’s office,\r\n[VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev025000_talk_10_m	You can feel the tension when those two show up.[VAR 0114(0007)]
msg_ev025000_talk_11_m	You haven’t met them, have you? The woman\nwith the reverence for space is Irida, leader of\r\nthe Pearl Clan.[VAR 0114(0007)]
msg_ev025000_talk_12_m	The man who was going on and on about time,\nAdaman, leads the Diamond Clan.[VAR 0114(0007)]
msg_ev025000_talk_13_m	The Diamond Clan and the Pearl Clan grudgingly\ncoexist at the moment. Apparently, things used to\r\nbe less peaceful.[VAR 0114(0007)]
msg_ev025000_talk_14_m	But the boss—I mean, the commander—is waiting.\c\nWe should save this conversation for after you\nreport to him.[VAR 0114(0007)]
msg_chap02_null_14	[~ 117]
msg_ev025200_talk_01	What do you intend to do about that Kleavor,\nCommander Kamado?!\c\nHe may be descended from a warrior of almighty\nSinnoh, but look at the mess he’s causing.\r\nWe can’t sit back and let him rage on![VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev025200_talk_02	You do get right to the point, Adaman...[VAR 0114(0009)]
msg_ev025200_talk_03	Time wasted is lost.[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev025200_talk_04	Well, tell me—what would you have us do?\nKleavor is a precious lord of the Pearl Clan,\r\nis he not?[VAR 0114(0009)]
msg_ev025200_talk_05	That’s the point. My clan can’t intervene directly\nwhere a lord of the Pearl Clan’s concerned.\c\nIf my people were to do something, our two\nclans might end up back at each other’s throats—\r\njust like we used to be.[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev025200_talk_06	But even folk of the Galaxy Team have been\nwounded, haven’t they? Seems someone’s got\r\nto do something here...[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev025200_talk_07	Who, then? Would the Diamond Clan have\nthe Pearl Clan bring down one of its own\r\nhonored nobles?[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev025200_talk_08	I don’t believe I said that. Thought it, maybe.[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev025200_talk_09	You might as well have said it, you fool!\c\nLook—we don’t even know what drove Lord\nKleavor into such a violent frenzy.[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev025200_talk_10	I’d like to know that myself. This is a first as far as\nmy clan knows, too.[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev025200_talk_11	Hrrrm. I see you’ve arrived.[VAR 0114(0009)]
msg_ev025200_talk_12	[VAR BD06(0000)]This is [VAR 0100(0000)], the newest\nmember\r\nof our\r\nSurvey Corps.[VAR 0114(0009)]
msg_ev025200_talk_13	Aha! I hear from Mai you earned Wyrdeer’s favor.[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev025200_talk_14	Good to finally meet you, stranger from the rift![VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev025200_talk_34	I’m “Adaman, leader of the Diamond Clan,”\nif you want to be formal!\c\nBut that’s a mouthful. Just call me Adaman.[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev025200_talk_15	If you came from beyond the space-time rift...\ncould you be from the space where almighty\r\nSinnoh is said to reside?[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev025200_talk_35	I’m Irida, leader of the Pearl Clan! Caution and\nforesight are my watchwords.\c\nWhich is why I have trouble believing such a tale.\nCould you really have passed through that rift?[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev025200_talk_16	I have a proposition. Why not send this one to\nstudy Kleavor before deciding what must be done?[VAR 0114(0009)]
msg_ev025200_talk_17	You’d send this stranger, who supposedly fell\nfrom the rift, to study Kleavor? This newcomer\r\nwith no experience?[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev025200_talk_18	Says the leader with almost no experience.[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev025200_talk_19	Being a good leader isn’t a matter of time—it’s a\nmatter of embracing Hisui’s vastness without fear![VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev025200_talk_20	Well, then, there you have it. If how new you are\ndoesn’t matter, then let’s give the kid h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]iser chance.\c\nI’m sold, Commander. Let’s try this your way![VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev025200_talk_21	This should be fun. I’ll get to see how good you\nGalaxy folk really are, with all your weird ways—\r\nputting Pokémon in those strange balls and what\r\nhave you.[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev025200_talk_22	That whole practice bothers me!\c\nAlmighty Sinnoh made Hisui vast so Pokémon\ncould live freely throughout.\c\nWe’re meant to stand alongside Pokémon, not\ncount ourselves above them![VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev025200_talk_23	We do not use Poké Balls from a desire to control\nour Pokémon. Only so that we can live together.\r\nAllow us to show you what we can do![VAR 0114(0009)]
msg_ev025200_talk_24	[VAR BD06(0000)]This is your mission now,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nI order you to study Kleavor and help us find the\ntruth of this situation![VAR 0114(0009)]
msg_ev025200_talk_25	I accept!
msg_ev025200_talk_26	Uh...
msg_ev025200_talk_27	Remember that you are a stranger who appeared\none day out of the very sky above us. People are\r\nnaturally suspicious of your presence here.[VAR 0114(0009)]
msg_ev025200_talk_28	If you wish to be fully accepted and trusted, you\nmust work hard. Work yourself to the very bone.[VAR 0114(0009)]
msg_ev025200_talk_29	Well, that’s settled. And there’s no time like\nthe present![VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev025200_talk_30	The Lord of the Woods—Kleavor—is descended\nfrom a Pokémon that was blessed with almighty\r\nSinnoh’s own power.\c\nNo other Pokémon you’ve yet encountered can\ncompare to his strength. Be warned.[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev025200_talk_31	Listen to me.\c\nThe Galaxy Expedition Team has come to the\nHisui region as a group of outsiders. Some might\r\neven call us interlopers.\c\nWe mustn’t do anything to threaten our relations\nwith the Diamond and Pearl Clans. Understand?[VAR 0114(0009)]
msg_ev025200_talk_33	If we’re to survive here in Hisui, we must learn\nabout the Pokémon surrounding us.\c\nIf they stand against us or would do us harm,\nthen we will subdue them...as we must.[VAR 0114(0009)]
msg_ev025200_talk_32	Join me downstairs, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nWe’ll cover the details of this new mission.[VAR 0114(0008)]
msg_chap02_null_31	[~ 153]
msg_ev025400_talk_01	Ah, good! You’re already here![VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_ev025400_talk_02	Professor Laventon. The briefing, if you please.[VAR 0114(0008)]
msg_ev025400_talk_03	[VAR BD06(0000)]Yes, let’s get right to it.\nSo, [VAR 0100(0000)]...\c\nI understand you’ve been requested to find out\nthe cause of Kleavor’s frenzied state.\c\nBut as you’re aware by now, Kleavor is a mighty\nthing. Nigh invincible, even![VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_ev025400_talk_04	The Security Corps tried throwing Poké Balls\nat Kleavor when they were attacked, but...[VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_ev025400_talk_05	I’m afraid they didn’t even come close to\ncatching him!\c\nIt seems he’s a far trickier opponent than even\nthose aggressive species of Pokémon that cannot\r\nbe caught outside of battle once they’re riled.[VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_ev025400_talk_06	I’d like to be perfectly clear on this point.\c\nThis mission will put you in extreme danger.\nDo you believe you can handle it?[VAR 0114(0008)]
msg_ev025400_list_01	Of course!
msg_ev025400_list_02	Not particularly
msg_ev025400_talk_07	Very well. Then let us go over the particulars.[VAR 0114(0008)]
msg_ev025400_talk_08	Well, you’ve no choice in the matter.\c\nLet us go over the details you need to know.\nYou have a mission to carry out.[VAR 0114(0008)]
msg_ev025400_talk_09	The Diamond and Pearl Clans revere their nobles\nbecause they believe these Pokémon serve their\r\n“almighty Sinnoh.”\c\nThey leave offerings to express their gratitude\nto these Pokémon in locations they call the\r\nnobles’ seats.[VAR 0114(0008)]
msg_ev025400_talk_10	So perhaps a good starting point for our research\ncould be to find out what sorts of offerings they\r\nnormally leave for this Kleavor.[VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_ev025400_talk_11	[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]! We need to speak\nwith you.[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_ev025400_talk_12	Listen—that rift in space-time seems like it\nconnects this world to a whole other world.\c\nThat world might be where almighty Sinnoh\nitself resides—the true almighty Sinnoh, that is.\r\nThe one that rules over time![VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev025400_talk_13	So if you fell through the space-time rift, that\nmight mean...you traveled through time—\r\nby almighty Sinnoh’s own power!\c\nThink of it! You must’ve been just swimming in\nits divine might!\c\nWell, I’ve got a favor to ask of you, oh amazing\ntime traveler.\c\nDon’t just study Kleavor. Quell his frenzy![VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev025400_talk_14	Well, you certainly caught us at a good time,\nyoung Adaman!\c\nWe were just discussing our next steps with\nregard to this whole Kleavor situation.[VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_ev025400_talk_15	Oho! You must be that Galaxy Team scholar I’ve\nheard about. Good to meet you, Mr. Professor.\r\nShare some of that knowledge with me sometime![VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev025400_talk_16	Now, let me elaborate a little...[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev025400_talk_17	Those Pearl Clan types have a lot of respect for\nKleavor. You heard his title—Lord of the Woods.\c\nI’m sure they’d rather get this under control, too,\nbut it’s hard for them to come right out and ask\r\nthose of the Galaxy Team, of all people, for help.[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev025400_talk_18	And the truth is, we in the Diamond Clan have a\nsimilar problem on our hands.\c\nA Pokémon dear to us, off in the mountains, has\nflown into the same type of frenzy as Kleavor.[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev025400_talk_19	Now, there’s certainly bad blood between us and\nthe Pearl Clan, but still...\c\nWe’ve all got to share Hisui, and that means we\nought to tackle our problems together.[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev025400_talk_20	But there aren’t many capable of standing up\nto such powerful Pokémon. You’re the best\r\nhope we’ve got.[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_ev025400_talk_21	You’ll find Kleavor at Grandtree Arena. That’s in\nthe very heart of the Heartwood. His warden is a\r\nboy named Lian.[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_ev025400_talk_22	Lian is a brilliant child but also a bit... Well.\nSometimes brilliance can be blinding, you know.\c\nHe’ll tell you all about his beloved Kleavor—\nwhether you wish him to or not.[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_ev025400_talk_23	Anyway, I’m sure you’re up to the challenge...so\nwe’ll be counting on you! See you later![VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev025400_talk_24	Wow. He just said his piece and then vanished.\nHe must just value his time that much...I guess.[VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev025400_talk_24_m	He certainly left quickly once he’d finished\ntalking. I suppose he really values his time.[VAR 0114(0007)]
msg_ev025400_talk_25	Adaman and Mai weren’t wrong, you know.\nIf you’re to study and perhaps even quell\r\nKleavor, you’d best start by visiting his abode.[VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_ev025400_talk_26	Now that we’ve got the Heights Camp, it should\ncome in handy for getting to Grandtree Arena.\c\nAnd don’t forget to visit the pastures! Choosing\nyour Pokémon team carefully makes a difference.[VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev025400_talk_27	Our new Heights Camp would be a handy place\nfor setting out toward Grandtree Arena.\c\nAnd you should stop by the pastures, too. You’ll\nwant to choose the best Pokémon to bring.[VAR 0114(0007)]
msg_ev025400_talk_28	Our investigation for the commander will grind to\na halt if you become incapacitated, recruit.\c\nI should like to avoid that outcome.\c\nI imagine you would as well, since it would mean\nlosing the food and shelter we provide for you.[VAR 0114(0008)]
msg_chap02_null_32	[~ 185]
msg_ev025500_talk_01	Finding yourself unable to pick up the materials\nyou come across? Satchel always seeming full?\c\nIf that sounds like you, it’d be wise to lend me\nyour ear a moment and hear what I have to say.[VAR 0114(009D)]
msg_chap02_null_35	[~ 187]
msg_ev025600_talk_01	How are things, my good friend![VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev025600_talk_02	I certainly hope you’re putting that Secret Back\nStrike Technique I taught you to good use![VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev025600_talk_03	Either way, I have some Super Potions here,\njust for you!\c\nOh, think nothing of it! Having the Survey Corps\nout and about studying Pokémon is great for\r\nbusiness, you know.\c\nSupporting you now is actually an investment in\nmy own fortunes![VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev025600_talk_04	And now I must depart! There are ruins that are\njust calling to me![VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_chap02_null_36	[~ 192]
msg_ev025600_talk_05	[~ 193]
msg_ev025600_talk_06	[~ 194]
msg_ev025600_talk_07	[~ 195]
msg_ev025600_talk_08	[~ 196]
msg_ev025600_talk_09	[~ 197]
msg_ev025600_talk_10	[~ 198]
msg_chap02_null_16	[~ 199]
msg_ev025800_talk_25	You managed to take on a powerful alpha.\nI see promise in you.[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev025800_talk_26	If you hope to reach the Grandtree Arena,\nperhaps consult that mystical map of yours?[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_chap02_null_17	[~ 202]
msg_ev026000_talk_01	I’m Lian of the Pearl Clan. The warden to\nKleavor, Lord of the Woods.[VAR 0114(0010)]
msg_ev026000_talk_02	And you—I’ve already deduced that you’ve\ncome here to meet Kleavor. I’m right, aren’t I?[VAR 0114(0010)]
msg_ev026000_talk_03	Of course I am! I can see it so clearly.\c\nAfter all, the powerfully awesome Kleavor has\nbecome even more awesomely powerful![VAR 0114(0010)]
msg_ev026000_talk_04	Perhaps that strange lightning the other day was\nalmighty Sinnoh’s divine power...\c\nBut whatever it was, it struck my lord and left him\nimbued with awesome might!\c\nSo I must turn you away, even if it pains me. It’s\ntoo dangerous for you to meet Kleavor right now.[VAR 0114(0010)]
msg_ev026000_list_01	I’ll do anything!
msg_ev026000_list_02	That’s that, then
msg_ev026000_talk_05	Oh! Such earnest desire to meet mighty Kleavor!\nI have to admit I’m struck by your passion...[VAR 0114(0010)]
msg_ev026000_talk_06	Truly? You mean to simply give up?! Is your\npassion for Kleavor so paltry?![VAR 0114(0010)]
msg_ev026000_talk_07	But, well...I’m afraid your passion is not the real\nissue here...\c\nI’ve been told in no uncertain terms by Irida that\nI am to let no one near Kleavor![VAR 0114(0010)]
msg_ev026000_talk_08	I will fight you off myself if you insist.\c\nIf you wish to avoid battle, withdraw now, while\nyou still can! Or face the wrath of my Goomy![VAR 0114(0010)]
msg_ev026000_list_05	I’ll take you on
msg_ev026000_list_06	I’m going to bow out
msg_ev026000_talk_09	You don’t even realize I’m turning you away for\nyour own safety! How sad you are...\c\nGo, Goomy, and see if you can ooze some good\nsense over this foolish troublemaker![VAR 0114(0010)]
msg_chap02_null_40	[~ 216]
msg_ev026005_talk_01	H-how can this be...[VAR 0114(0010)]
msg_ev026005_talk_02	I may’ve been defeated, but my point still stands!\nIt’s too dangerous to meet Kleavor now.\c\nThe only welcome you’ll get if you approach him\nis a flurry of devastating blows![VAR 0114(0010)]
msg_ev026005_talk_03	Normally, I’d simply try making him an offering...\c\nA nice heaped helping of his two favorite foods,\nserved up with respect by his loyal warden—\r\nthat’s me, o’ course—is usually enough to please\r\nhim and soothe the prickliest of moods...[VAR 0114(0010)]
msg_ev026005_talk_04	But even I, Kleavor’s loyal warden, can’t get\nclose enough to give any offerings now—not with\r\nthe way Kleavor is rampaging and running amok.\c\nThere’s nothing that an outsider like you can do.[VAR 0114(0010)]
msg_ev026005_talk_05	The ancestors of Kleavor, Wyrdeer, and their\ncohort drew on almighty Sinnoh’s own power to\r\nprotect Pokémon and people alike—so it’s said.\c\nIt’s by their grace that our clan—that any of us—\nstill lives in vast Hisui today![VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev026005_talk_06	Irida? What are you doing here?[VAR 0114(0010)]
msg_ev026005_talk_07	As you say, Kleavor’s grown even stronger, but\nI’m afraid that strength poses a problem for us.\c\nIf he was indeed struck by that lightning...could\nthe bolts have been sent by the false Sinnoh that\r\nthe Diamond Clan bows to?[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev026005_talk_08	Kleavor means so much to our clan...\c\nI’d hoped we could bring this situation under\ncontrol ourselves, not throw our hands up and\r\nask some outsider for help...[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev026005_talk_09	But we must save Kleavor from this frenzy.\nEvery moment it continues, the danger grows.\c\nIf more people and Pokémon are attacked,\nit will lead to conflict with both the Diamond\r\nClan and the Galaxy Team.[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev026005_talk_10	You! Stranger from beyond the sky! Tell me...\nCould you Galaxy people actually fix all this?\c\nCould an outsider actually find a way to quell\nour lord’s frenzy?[VAR 0114(0010)]
msg_ev026005_list_01	I’ll figure something out
msg_ev026005_list_02	I don’t know
msg_ev026005_talk_11	Very well!\c\nLian and I will gather foods that please Kleavor,\nin hopes that we might be able to get close\r\nenough to make him a proper offering.\c\nAs for you—find a way to quell his frenzy, even\nif you must search every corner of vast Hisui![VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev026005_talk_12	Your commander tasked you with investigating\nthis mess, didn’t he?\c\nLian and I will gather foods that please Kleavor,\nin hopes that we might be able to get close\r\nenough to make him a proper offering.\c\nAs for you—find a way to quell his frenzy, even\nif you have to search every corner of vast Hisui![VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev026005_talk_80	We can’t let Kleavor remain some pariah.\nIt isn’t right![VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev026005_talk_81	I’m not actually opposed to Kleavor remaining\nas powerful as he is now, but I suppose if Irida is\r\nbothered, then we must do something...[VAR 0114(0010)]
msg_ev026005_sys_01	Your Arc Phone is beeping...
msg_ev026005_sys_02	A mysterious power now enables you to return\nto base camps in an instant!
msg_chap02_null_39	[~ 235]
msg_ev026010_talk_01	Good to see you, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nAnd how is your research into Kleavor going?\nSwimmingly, I expect?[VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_ev026010_talk_02	...Oho, is that so? Now that’s quite the tidbit!\c\nSo a serving of his favorite foods will normally\nmake Kleavor quite agreeable—is that it?[VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_ev026010_talk_03	I need to mull this over back at the laboratory.\nYou should come along, too, dear [VAR 1100(00FF,0403)]boygirl.[VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_ev026010_talk_04	[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)], my [VAR 1100(00FF,0403)]boygirl![VAR 0114(0005)]

msg_ev026100_talk_01	So according to the information you were able to\nlearn from Irida and Lian of the Pearl Clan...[VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_ev026100_talk_02	were this the normal course of events, that\nfrenzied Kleavor would be calmed by a nice\r\nserving of his two favorite foods...[VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_ev026100_talk_03	I do wonder...\c\nIs it possible that the aromas or some other\ncomponents of these foods might combine in a\r\nway that could not only calm Kleavor but draw\r\nhim back from this frenzy?[VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_ev026100_talk_04	But by your own report, even Kleavor’s warden—\nwho looks after Kleavor and knows him well—\r\ncannot approach him in his current state.\c\nIt would be a fool’s gambit to get close enough\nto offer him food...[VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_ev026100_talk_09	Hmmm... Give me a moment, if you would.\nI need some time to ponder on this...[VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_ev026100_talk_13	There ought to be something in my research\nnotes that can help us...[VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_ev026100_talk_05	Eureka![VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_ev026100_talk_06	We’ll simply have to throw the food!\c\nYou’ve quite the arm for throwing things, haven’t\nyou, [VAR 0100(0000)]?\c\nMight I suggest you take Kleavor’s favorite foods\nand throw them at the Pokémon?[VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_ev026100_list_01	Makes sense!
msg_ev026100_list_02	Elaborate, please?
msg_ev026100_talk_07	Yes, it’s all coming together! We can use our\nskill in Poké Ball crafting to shape Kleavor’s\r\nbeloved foods into balls, then throw them to\r\nachieve the same calming effect—but from afar!\c\nA brilliant idea, if I do say so myself. As for what\nto call these yummy projectiles...\c\nWell, how about Teatime Balls? Puts one in mind\nof a nice, relaxing afternoon tea, does it not?[VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_ev026100_talk_10	Are you...sure, Professor? They’re your own\ninventions—why not call them Laventon Balls?[VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev026100_talk_10_m	Why wouldn’t you simply call them Laventon\nBalls, Professor?[VAR 0114(0007)]
msg_ev026100_talk_11	Oh my. With that name, it’d sound like I’m the\none being launched at our frenzied friend...[VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_ev026100_talk_14	In any case, we can rely on the Pearl Clan to\ngather the necessary foodstuffs, correct?[VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_ev026100_talk_12	Then you should hurry back to Grandtree Arena\nand tell the Pearl Clan about our brilliant plan![VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev026100_talk_12_m	Then you should get back to Grandtree Arena\nand let the Pearl Clan know our plan![VAR 0114(0007)]
msg_ev026100_talk_08	If you’re off to Grandtree Arena, best set out\nfrom the Heights Camp, eh?[VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_chap02_null_19	[~ 259]
msg_ev026202_talk_01	My, my, that Galaxy Hall is one fine building,\neven from the outside...\c\nThe Galaxy Team’s certainly got themselves\na grand headquarters—I’ll give them that.[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_ev026202_talk_02	Oh! Yes, I came because I had some news that\nI thought you might be interested in.[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_ev026202_talk_03	Better you actually see what’s going on, though.\nLet’s head to... What did you end up calling it?\r\nThe Heights Camp?[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_chap02_null_45	[~ 263]
msg_ev026205_talk_01	Wyeeer!
msg_ev026205_talk_02	I spoke to Wyrdeer about what’s been going on.\c\nI told him how you’ve been trekking all over the\nfieldlands seeking a way to quell Kleavor’s frenzy.[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev026205_talk_03	All this, from someone who’s not even part of our\nclan or the Pearl Clan.\c\nJust some wanderer who fell through a rift into\nthis world.[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev026205_talk_04	And hearing that... Well, you can see how\nhe responded![VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev026205_talk_06	I trust you appreciate it.[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_ev026205_talk_08	Wyrdeer’s found you worthy, you see.\nWhich means you’ll need a flute like we have.[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev026205_talk_09	Mind demonstrating for h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer, Mai?[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev026205_talk_10	This is very important, so listen well![VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev026205_talk_11	Wyeeer!
msg_ev026205_talk_12	That’s a Celestica Flute that Mai just played.\c\nIt’s a precious tool that can be used to call on\nWyrdeer so you can ride upon him![VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev026205_talk_13	It’s said the Celestica Flutes were gifts from\nalmighty Sinnoh itself...and now, this one’s yours![VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev026205_talk_14	It’s not that grand a gesture, really. I can’t play\nthe flute for the life of me.[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev026205_talk_15	See if you can play that melody.[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_ev026205_sys_16	Wyrdeer opened his heart and learned well the\nsound of your playing!
msg_ev026205_sys_19	You can now call Wyrdeer and gallop across\nthe land!
msg_ev026205_sys_20	You received the Mind Plate from Wyrdeer!
msg_ev026205_talk_17	Now, use that Celestica Flute wisely and gallop\nacross the land with the great Wyrdeer!\c\nYou’ve got a frenzied Pokémon to quell at\nGrandtree Arena, haven’t you?[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_ev026205_talk_18	With Wyrdeer, you can gallop across the\nfieldlands in no time![VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_chap02_null_43	[~ 282]
msg_ev026400_talk_01	So you say that you Galaxy people came up with\na method to try to quell Lord Kleavor’s frenzy?[VAR 0114(0010)]
msg_ev026400_talk_02	What? You’ll mash up Kleavor’s favorite foods\ninto balls so you can THROW offerings at him?!\c\nWell, that’s quite an unorthodox approach...\c\nYou Galaxy people... Your inventiveness just\nblows me away!\c\nI mean, now you can make offerings to Lord\nKleavor...from a safe distance![VAR 0114(0010)]
msg_ev026400_talk_04	I’ll lend you my aid if it means we might provide\nKleavor with his offering. Let’s begin at once![VAR 0114(0010)]
msg_ev026400_talk_05	Hold on, Lian! Don’t get ahead of yourself.[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev026400_talk_17	Whatever the plan is, you’ll need Kleavor’s\nfavorite Plump Beans. I’ve brought them,\r\nas promised.[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev026400_talk_06	Gah! That’s right! My apologies, Irida—\nI’d forgotten all about you![VAR 0114(0010)]
msg_ev026400_talk_07	I admit, as we haven’t been able to solve this\nourselves, we seem to have little choice but to\r\nturn to the Galaxy Team.[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev026400_talk_10	But even I still have my doubts about whether\nwe should entrust such a thing to an outsider.\c\nThese Galaxy Team people don’t share our\ncustoms or our values.[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev026400_talk_11	So prove to me you’re worthy to stand in the\npresence of our noble Pokémon!\c\nYou may battle by ordering about the Pokémon\nyou’ve caught in your little Poké Balls...\c\nBut on my side, I have a Pokémon as close to me\nas a sister—as one of my blood![VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev026400_talk_12	If you can defeat Glaceon and me, I will entrust\nyou with Kleavor’s fate. Will you battle us?[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev026400_list_01	Yes, I will
msg_ev026400_list_02	Hold on...
msg_ev026400_talk_13	I’m not surprised that this would be too much to\nask of a strange outsider from the sky.[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev026400_talk_14	Then allow Glaceon’s true strength to chill you\nto your depths![VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev026400_talk_15	I see now... Poké Balls are simply your tools of\nchoice, not products of disregard for Pokémon.\c\nYou still understand the Pokémon that you’ve\ncaught and treat them as partners.\c\nI feel better putting my trust in you now, I think.\nLet me see to your Pokémon’s wounds.[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev026400_talk_16	Now, explain the Galaxy Team’s plan. What do\nyou mean to do with these foods?[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev026400_talk_08	So because you have to keep your distance,\nyou’ll mash Kleavor’s favorite foods together,\r\nball them up, and try to quell his frenzy by...\r\nthrowing them at him?\c\nInteresting. So you’ve developed soothing [VAR FF00(0006)]balms\n[VAR FF00(0000)]of sorts to calm our lord...[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev026400_talk_09	Very well. If it’ll help soothe Kleavor’s frenzy,\nlet’s make these balms with our very hearts\r\nand souls![VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_chap02_null_26	[~ 301]
msg_ev027000_talk_07	There! A veritable mountain of balms! This should\nplease Kleavor, if anything can...[VAR 0114(0010)]
msg_ev027000_talk_01	Now then...ready yourself! And I will summon our\nmighty Kleavor, Lord of the Woods.[VAR 0114(0010)]
msg_ev027000_list_01	I’m ready!
msg_ev027000_list_02	Let’s not be hasty
msg_ev027000_talk_02	Are you serious?!\c\nAfter everything we readied for this moment,\nyou’re simply going to back out?! Outrageous![VAR 0114(0010)]
msg_ev027000_talk_03	As am I![VAR 0114(0010)]
msg_ev027000_talk_10	Oh mighty Kleavor, Lord of the Woods...\nThough it isn’t yet the time of ceremony, we’ve\r\nprepared an offering of your favorite things.[VAR 0114(0010)]
msg_ev027000_talk_04	Benevolent lord who works his might between\nthe heavens and earth, we offer our gratitude.\c\nAnd beseech you—reveal yourself to our eyes...[VAR 0114(0010)]
msg_ev027000_talk_05	[VAR BD06(0000)]Listen well, [VAR 0100(0000)]—keep\nyour\r\nfocus\r\non Kleavor!\c\nDodging will be vital. Try to avoid his moves as\nyou’re throwing the balms![VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev027000_talk_06	Graaashaaa!
msg_ev027000_talk_08	Oh mighty Kleavor, Lord of the Woods...\nWe beseech you—reveal yourself to our eyes...[VAR 0114(0010)]
msg_ev027000_talk_09	Stay focused on Kleavor! And when he tries to\nget you with a move, dodge out of the way![VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev027000_talk_11	Come on! You’re the one with the best chance of\nusing these balms to the fullest![VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_chap02_null_27	[~ 315]
msg_ev027010_sys_19	You received the Insect Plate from Kleavor!
msg_ev027010_talk_01	Wh-what happened?![VAR 0114(0010)]
msg_ev027010_talk_02	Some kind of light erupted from Kleavor’s body![VAR 0114(0010)]
msg_ev027010_talk_03	Has Lord Kleavor’s frenzied mind truly been\nput at ease now?![VAR 0114(0010)]
msg_ev027010_talk_04	Does this confirm that the strange lightning was\nto blame for Kleavor’s unnatural power?[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev027010_list_01	Maybe...
msg_ev027010_list_02	I don’t know
msg_ev027010_talk_05	Well...this is what I think, after all we’ve seen.[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev027010_talk_06	We know strange lightning came from out of the\nspace-time rift the other night...\c\nThose bolts must have struck Kleavor and driven\nhim into his frenzy after all.[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev027010_talk_07	The lightning came from the space-time rift?[VAR 0114(0010)]
msg_ev027010_talk_08	But if almighty Sinnoh really does dwell beyond\nthat space-time rift, then the strange lightning...\r\nIt indeed was almighty Sinnoh’s power?![VAR 0114(0010)]
msg_ev027010_talk_09	Then were we even right to try to interfere?\c\nI happily went along with this plan to create some\nbalms, as if I knew what I was doing—like some\r\nkind of thoughtless fool! Outrageous![VAR 0114(0010)]
msg_ev027010_talk_10	Calm yourself, Lian.\c\nRemember that the Lord of the Woods has long\nbeen our protector, keeping the Pearl Clan safe\r\nfrom dangerous Pokémon that might harm us.[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev027010_talk_11	[VAR BD06(0000)]Would power sent by the true almighty Sinnoh\nhave driven Kleavor to turn on us and attack\r\npeople and Pokémon indiscriminately? I doubt it.\c\nWhat [VAR 0100(0000)] accomplished\njust\r\nnow...\r\nIt\r\nneeded\r\nto\r\nbe done.[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev027010_talk_12	I’m glad we could settle this without further strife\nwith the Diamond Clan or the Galaxy Team.\c\nIf you come across other Pokémon in the grip of\nthis painful frenzy, please help them.[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev027010_talk_13	Hrmmm... Yes. Fine. I suppose I must concur.\c\nI apologize for becoming briefly incomposed.\nI’m grateful for what you’ve done for my lord.[VAR 0114(0010)]
msg_ev027010_talk_14	Please, take these—on behalf of the Pearl Clan.\c\nConsider it my apology for having spoken rudely\nto you earlier...and a token of my thanks.[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev027010_talk_15	Let me care for your Pokémon as well.\nIn appreciation for fighting on our behalf![VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev027010_talk_17	I think I’ve finally come to believe that you truly\ndid fall out of the sky...\c\nThough I still cannot imagine the reasons at play.[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev027010_talk_18	And it seems we’ve settled things here.\nThough, between you and me...\c\nI wouldn’t mind seeing Lord Kleavor in such a\nfrenzy again. He was fearfully strong, after all![VAR 0114(0010)]
msg_chap02_null_29	[~ 336]
msg_ev027020_talk_01	I saw the light fading into the sky. You must have\nquelled the lord Pokémon![VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev027020_talk_02	And what do you have there? Could it be...?[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev027020_talk_09	Ah! Those are two of the fabled plates of old!\nPlease, let me have a look![VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev027020_talk_03	I see there are some letters carved into them.\nLet’s see. This one says...\c\n“Where all creation was born, that is the being’s\nplace of origin.”[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev027020_talk_04	It seems to be a phrase from a very old myth.\nHow did you come across these?[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev027020_talk_05	I see! So you were given the plates when you\nimpressed Wyrdeer and Kleavor?[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev027020_talk_06	That is quite something, indeed! My heart is\npractically racing with excitement![VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev027020_talk_07	It is my guess that you will find more plates like\nthese scattered across Hisui!\c\nIf we were to gather them all and decipher the\nscripts on them, we may uncover something\r\nabsolutely amazing![VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev027020_talk_08	The mysteries of the past! Oh, how they tickle\nmy curiosity! What a joy to be alive in such times!\r\nWell, I must be on my way. Until next time![VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_chap02_null_30	[~ 346]
msg_ev027200_talk_01	Hrrrm. Well done![VAR 0114(0009)]
msg_ev027200_talk_02	I have already received the reports of\nyour exploits.\c\nYou successfully quelled Kleavor’s frenzy,\nrestoring peace of mind to Hisui’s people.[VAR 0114(0009)]
msg_ev027200_talk_03	You are a stranger to us—one who fell out of\nthe very sky. Yet you have served the Galaxy\r\nTeam admirably.\c\nI admit you have earned yourself some degree\nof recognition.[VAR 0114(0009)]
msg_ev027200_talk_04	But things are not settled yet.\c\nI’ve received word that there are other Pokémon\nnobles falling prey to such frenzies elsewhere\r\nin Hisui.[VAR 0114(0009)]
msg_ev027200_talk_05	So carry on with your research and survey duties,\nand prove that you truly are an asset to us![VAR 0114(0009)]
msg_ev027200_talk_06	That is all. You are dismissed.\c\nYour fellow Survey Corps members are likely at\nthe Wallflower. Go and join them.[VAR 0114(0009)]

msg_ev030800_list_01	Sure, why not?
msg_ev030800_list_02	I’ve got a mission
msg_ev030800_talk_03	Come on—don’t just hang me out to dry. I’ve got\nno one else to ask![VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev030800_talk_04	That’s the stuff! I’ll feel a lot better going out\nresearching on my own if I can beat you.[VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev030800_talk_01_m	Oh, hello, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0007)]
msg_ev030800_talk_02_m	I was just getting the itch to battle with you, and\nnow here you are. It must be a sign![VAR 0114(0007)]
msg_ev030800_list_01_m	You’re right!
msg_ev030800_list_02_m	I’ve got a mission
msg_ev030800_talk_03_m	Even after all I did to help you acclimate?\nI think you owe me at least this much...[VAR 0114(0007)]

msg_ev030810_talk_01	Seems right that the one who could defeat a lord\nwould beat me, too, I guess![VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev030810_talk_02	Whoa! Maybe Pikachu and I are getting better![VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev030810_talk_04	Thanks for that battle. Here—let me give you a\nnew recipe.[VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev030810_talk_03	Y’know, lately these [VAR FF00(0006)]space-time distortion[VAR FF00(0000)] things\nhave been popping up here and there.\c\nI took a peek into one and saw some tempting\nitems, so I tried ducking in to grab ’em.\c\nBut it turned out there were legions of tough\nPokémon inside. I barely made it out alive...\r\nYou be careful around those distortions, all right?\c\nAnyway! Time to make for the Mirelands Camp.[VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev030810_talk_01_m	Pikachu may not be very happy with me\nafter that.[VAR 0114(0007)]

msg_ev030810_talk_03_m	So I’ve been working on studying those strange\n[VAR FF00(0006)]space-time distortions[VAR FF00(0000)].\c\nDo you know the ones I mean? They’ve been\nappearing here and there lately.\c\nIt seems like they hold wonderful items—but\nfrightfully strong Pokémon, too. If you plan to go\r\ninto one, be careful about it!\c\nNow, time to head to the Mirelands Camp.[VAR 0114(0007)]
msg_evchap03_null_26	[~ 57]

msg_ev031000_talk_02	Oh, that’s right! You’re heading to the Solaceon\nRuins, aren’t you?\c\nThey’re off that way, if you need a pointer.\nSee the entrance way over there?[VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev031000_talk_03	Y’know, I wish we could tell where or when one\nof those space-time distortions was going to\r\nerupt... I wonder if checking your map would help.[VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev031000_talk_02_m	[VAR BD06(0000)]I’ve heard about your mission,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nIf you’re looking for the Solaceon Ruins, they’re\noff that way.[VAR 0114(0007)]
msg_ev031000_talk_03_m	For now, I’ll keep searching for those space-time\ndistortions. There’s little way of knowing when or\r\nwhere one might appear, but I’ll do my best!\c\nIt sure would be handy if my map could tell me...[VAR 0114(0007)]
msg_ev031000_talk_05	I’m counting on both of you to carry out your\nsurvey work as best you can! But be mindful of\r\nyour limitations as well, won’t you?\c\nIf wild Pokémon are giving you trouble, I suggest\nyou go to the training grounds and have Captain\r\nZisu teach your Pokémon some strong moves.[VAR 0114(0005)]

msg_ev031200_list_02	I guess?
msg_ev031200_talk_04	I see, I see...[VAR 0114(0011)]
msg_ev031200_talk_05	Why the vague response, hmmm? Something\nto hide?[VAR 0114(0011)]
msg_ev031200_talk_06	I’ve already heard about you. That you quelled\nKleavor in his frenzy.[VAR 0114(0011)]
msg_ev031200_talk_07	I’m sure many people were saved by your\nactions, but I wonder if there wasn’t some other\r\nway to handle the situation...[VAR 0114(0011)]
msg_ev031200_talk_08	What you did is hardly different from bullying a\nPokémon into submission, after all.\c\nAnd you run about catching Pokémon up in those\nlittle balls you carry...[VAR 0114(0011)]
msg_ev031200_talk_09	I don’t need any help from your sort. Or the\nDiamond Clan, for that matter.\c\nThat young lady, Arezu, offered to help, but\nassociating with the Diamond Clan...\r\nIt just won’t do.[VAR 0114(0011)]
msg_ev031200_talk_10	Be on your way.\c\nThere is much I must do, and I’d prefer not to be\ndistracted any further.[VAR 0114(0011)]
msg_ev031200_talk_11	[VAR BD06(0000)]Ah, [VAR 0100(0000)]! How about\nyou\r\nshow\r\nme\r\nthe\r\nstrength\r\nthat\r\ncould\r\nquell\r\neven\r\na\r\nfrenzied lord?[VAR 0114(000C)]

msg_ev031200_talk_12	Who knows when I’ll get the chance next?\nPlease, I ask that you face me now![VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev031200_talk_13	A battle with you might let me experience even\na fraction of the power the nobles wield![VAR 0114(000C)]

msg_ev031210_talk_01	Such prodigious strength! Now, let me just heal\nup your Pokémon...[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev031210_talk_02	Well now! I think that settles it.\c\nI must ask your help in retrieving the stolen Wall\nFragment. With your skill, it should be a cinch![VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev031210_list_01	Wall Fragment?
msg_ev031210_list_02	Wait—stolen?
msg_ev031210_talk_03	Yes, exactly!\c\nSome bandits pillaged the Solaceon Ruins and\nmade off with a fragment of the wall engravings![VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev031210_talk_04	Have you not heard of the notorious\nMiss Fortunes?\c\nThey’re a trio of bandits that have even hit us\nGinkgo Guild merchants more than a few times!\r\nNot the kind of regulars I like to have, let me\r\ntell you![VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev031210_talk_05	Mistress Calaba is doing everything she can to\nregain the fragment, but at 99 years old...\c\nIt’s a bit hard for her to chase leads all over\nthe place.[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev031210_talk_06	So what do you say, kind [VAR 1100(00FF,0503)]sirmadam? Why not help\nfind the fragment for the warden?[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev031210_talk_07	Oh—naturally I’ll be happy to lend you a hand!\c\nThose sisters swiped my wares, too, and I’m no\nGinkgo Guild merchant if I take that lying down![VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev031210_talk_08	And far be it from me to let them just get away\nwith vandalizing the precious ruins of this region![VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev031210_talk_09	You know, I did see the remains of a campfire\nnear the Mirelands Camp. Perhaps worth\r\nchecking out?[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_evchap03_null_10	[~ 95]
msg_ev031400_talk_01	It’s a burned-out campfire. Somebody must have\nbeen here...
msg_ev031400_talk_02	Now who might you be? Not some stray traveler,\nfrom the look of you.[VAR 0114(0004)]
msg_ev031400_talk_03	There’s only one reason people go poking\naround out here in the middle of nowhere.\c\nYou’re after us three, aren’t you?![VAR 0114(0004)]
msg_ev031400_talk_04	Sisters, we should introduce ourselves properly...\c\nbefore we show this poor fool how wrong [VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]she\nwas to assume [VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]she could ever beat us.[VAR 0114(0004)]
msg_ev031400_talk_05	I bring good luck to my sisters wherever I go—\nand ill luck to anyone who crosses our paths.\c\nI’m the eldest, and I’ll be your unlucky Charm![VAR 0114(0022)]
msg_ev031400_talk_06	Thought you spotted a four-leaf clover? Well, I’ll\nsoon have you seeing double!\c\nI’m the middle sister, and I’m one Clover you\ncan’t pick![VAR 0114(0023)]
msg_ev031400_talk_07	Heads, I win, and tails, you lose—you’ve got no\nchance in this game of fortunes.\c\nI’m the youngest, Coin, but I’m definitely not\nyour good-luck piece.[VAR 0114(0024)]
msg_ev031400_talk_08	We’re the infamous bandit trio, the Miss Fortune\nsisters—and your luck’s just run out!
msg_ev031400_talk_09	Let me handle this, sisters. I’ll only hurt h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer\na little.[VAR 0114(0024)]

msg_ev031410_talk_12	The weird writing on it made us think the stupid\nthing was some kinda treasure.\c\nBut it turned out to be a worthless slab of junk.\nTch! All that effort for nothing![VAR 0114(0023)]
msg_ev031410_talk_13	Tell me—why were you even seeking us out?\nWhat set you on this path?[VAR 0114(0022)]
msg_ev031410_list_01	I wanted to help Calaba
msg_ev031410_list_02	I wanted to help Ursaluna
msg_ev031410_talk_14	Goodness, how selfless of you—to go so far out\nof your way for the sake of another.[VAR 0114(0022)]
msg_ev031410_talk_15	Not all of us have the luxury of offering such\nunthinking kindness to strangers.\c\nFor some of us, simply surviving another day\ntakes all that we have.[VAR 0114(0022)]
msg_ev031410_talk_16	And I’ve got a score to settle with the Galaxy\nTeam...which now includes you![VAR 0114(0022)]
msg_ev031410_talk_17	Remember what those ancient verses tell us...\c\n“Why is it, in days of spring,\nbeneath the soft caress of the sun,\r\nthe blossoms tremble and fall,\r\nspirits lashed by uncertainty?”\c\nYour days are also numbered, Galaxy fool.[VAR 0114(0022)]
msg_evchap03_null_11	[~ 116]
msg_ev031600_talk_01	[VAR BD06(0000)]Good work, very good work indeed,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nYou got the fragment back safe and sound![VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev031600_talk_02	I’m well aware of Calaba’s reputation—they say\nshe’s stubborn, too old-fashioned, and so on...[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev031600_talk_03	But she’s given the Pearl Clan all she has, ever\nsince she was young. She lived her prime years\r\nhere in the Hisui region, trusting in the guidance\r\nof almighty Sinnoh.[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev031600_talk_04	I don’t think it’s that she hates the Diamond Clan\nor the Galaxy Team—rather, I think she simply\r\nloves the Pearl Clan very, very much.[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev031600_talk_05	Anyway, I do hope you’re able to calm Ursaluna’s\nfrenzy, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nA raging Pokémon in the area definitely isn’t\ngood for business, I assure you.[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_evchap03_null_12	[~ 122]
msg_ev031800_talk_01	Oh, so you’ve come to bother me again?\nWell, come as often as you’d like, but it won’t\r\nchange my mind.[VAR 0114(0011)]
msg_ev031800_list_01	This Wall Fragment...
msg_ev031800_list_02	Those three bandits...
msg_ev031800_talk_02	What? You went and retrieved the fragment\nfrom those bandits?\c\nWhy go out of your way like that for a complete\nstranger like me?[VAR 0114(0011)]
msg_ev031800_talk_03	I guess you’re that eager to calm Ursaluna, hmm?[VAR 0114(0011)]
msg_ev031800_list_03	That’s right
msg_ev031800_list_04	If possible
msg_ev031800_talk_04	I’ll admit, I didn’t expect anybody else to truly\ncare for Ursaluna...\c\nWell then, let’s see that Wall Fragment.[VAR 0114(0011)]

msg_ev032210_talk_01	Oh my. Scared, are you?[VAR 0114(0011)]

msg_ev032210_talk_05	Bleeeeeegh!
msg_ev032210_talk_06	It’s so potent that we can only use it on tough,\nresilient Pokémon, like Ursaluna.\c\nThere, there, dear Ursaluna. You’ve calmed down\nnow, haven’t you?[VAR 0114(0011)]
msg_ev032210_talk_07	This is all very strange, though...[VAR 0114(0011)]
msg_ev032210_list_01	He wasn’t glowing
msg_ev032210_list_02	He wasn’t really frenzied
msg_ev032210_talk_08	Very astute of you, Galaxy Team recruit.\c\nYou’re exactly right. When you quelled Kleavor’s\nfrenzy, I could see the strange light rising into the\r\nsky all the way from here.[VAR 0114(0011)]
msg_ev032210_talk_09	But no such strange light erupted from Ursaluna\nafter you defeated him, nor was he glowing.[VAR 0114(0011)]
msg_ev032210_talk_10	And what is this clinging to Ursaluna’s coat?\nIt seems like some kind of powder...[VAR 0114(0011)]
msg_ev032210_talk_11	That girl from the Diamond Clan, Arezu...\nNow, why did she of all people find the need to\r\ncome and tell me about Ursaluna, I wonder?[VAR 0114(0011)]

msg_ev032210_sys_13	Ursaluna opened his heart and learned well the\nsound of your playing!
msg_ev032210_sys_17	You can now call Ursaluna and dig for treasure!
msg_ev032210_sys_18	You received the Earth Plate from Ursaluna!
msg_ev032210_talk_14	Ursaluna is very good at finding things that are\nburied in the ground.\c\nWe say that he’s digging for treasure, even if\nthese treasures might not always glitter or gleam.[VAR 0114(0011)]

msg_ev035200_talk_05	But this isn’t the time for cultural lessons!\c\nI’d like to find out just what Arezu was thinking,\nbut she’s nowhere in Jubilife Village.[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev035200_talk_06	Last I saw, she was at the Wallflower, polishing\noff a big ol’ plate of potato mochi.\c\nNot that I blame her—my cooking is simply\nirresistible, after all.[VAR 0114(000E)]
msg_ev035200_talk_07	If Arezu of the Diamond Clan was somehow\ninvolved in that situation with the raging Ursaluna\r\nof the Pearl Clan, it could lead to the two clans\r\ngoing at each other’s throats again![VAR 0114(0009)]
msg_ev035200_talk_08	Tell me, Commander. If we do end up in a struggle\nwith the Pearl Clan, what will your people do?[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev035200_talk_09	We would be forced to remain neutral...[VAR 0114(0009)]
msg_ev035200_talk_10	Meaning what?[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev035200_talk_11	If we were to show support for one side, it\nwould put us at odds with the other.\c\nWe came here to create a home for ourselves,\nnot to take part in tearing the land apart...[VAR 0114(0009)]
msg_ev035200_talk_12	Right. Of course...\c\nAfter all the work you’ve put in to get us to treat\none another as equals and keep us from fighting...\c\nI suppose it’s no surprise you’d refuse to\nintervene if trouble were to break out again.[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev035200_talk_13	[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)], perhaps you have\nsome\r\nidea\r\nhow\r\nwe\r\nmight\r\naddress\r\nthis situation?[VAR 0114(0009)]
msg_ev035200_list_03	I could call Ursaluna
msg_ev035200_list_04	Not really
msg_ev035200_talk_14	Ursaluna? So he and Warden Calaba found you\nworthy? That’s perfect, then.\c\nUrsaluna should be able to sniff out Arezu,\nwherever she’s gone.[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev035200_talk_15	I know—why don’t we call in Ursaluna? He has a\nkeen nose for tracking.[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev035200_talk_16	If you are strong enough that Ursaluna deemed\nyou worthy, then you should be ready to quell\r\nLilligant’s frenzy as well.[VAR 0114(0009)]
msg_ev035200_talk_17	I’ll head to Lilligant’s seat, then—Brava Arena,\nit’s called. If you’ll excuse me![VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev035200_talk_18	[VAR BD06(0000)]Listen well, [VAR 0100(0000)]. You must\nquell\r\nany\r\nPokémon\r\nthat\r\ncould\r\ncause\r\nharm\r\nto the\r\npeople\r\nof Hisui.\c\nAlways remember: we came here to make a new\nhome where we could live without war or strife.[VAR 0114(0009)]
msg_evchap03_null_16	[~ 194]
msg_ev035400_talk_01	That girl who set out earlier must’ve been eating\nsome of Beni’s potato mochi.\c\nI could still smell them on her.
msg_ev035400_talk_02	That reminds me—I’ve seen Mistress Calaba\nriding around on that Ursaluna she serves,\r\ndigging for treasure in the ground.\c\nI wonder if Ursaluna uses his sense of smell to\nsuss out where treasure might be?
msg_evchap03_null_17	[~ 197]
msg_ev035400_talk_03	Ursaluna now knows Arezu’s scent. Follow the\nblue signals to find her!
msg_evchap03_null_18	[~ 199]
msg_ev035600_talk_01	[VAR BD06(0000)]Oh, [VAR 0100(0000)]... How did it all go\nwith Ursaluna?[VAR 0114(0012)]
msg_ev035600_list_01	I helped him
msg_ev035600_list_02	I calmed him down
msg_ev035600_talk_02	Thanks a bunch, [VAR 1100(00FF,0405)]fellagirl. But...how’d you find me\nall the way out here?[VAR 0114(0012)]
msg_ev035600_talk_03	Wow, you really are strong. But...how’d you find\nme all the way out here?[VAR 0114(0012)]
msg_ev035600_list_03	Ursaluna found you
msg_ev035600_list_04	From the potato mochi
msg_ev035600_talk_04	He tracked me all the way here by the scent of\nthose potato mochi I ate?\c\nThat Ursaluna sure is something. I know he’s\ndescended from one of the Pokémon that were\r\nblessed by almighty Sinnoh...but still, wow![VAR 0114(0012)]
msg_ev035600_talk_05	You followed the scent of the potato mochi I\nbought at the Wallflower?\c\nMan, I wish I could eat some more of those right\nnow... Jubilife Village sure was a lot of fun.[VAR 0114(0012)]
msg_ev035600_talk_06	My luck’s run out, though...as you can most\nlikely tell.\c\nI got chased by a Pokémon and sprained my\nankle pretty bad as I was running away.\r\nIt’s almost like the world wants to punish me...[VAR 0114(0012)]
msg_ev035600_talk_07	Ahhh, there you are. Arezu, right?[VAR 0114(0011)]
msg_ev035600_talk_08	Eeek![VAR 0114(0012)]
msg_ev035600_talk_27	M-Mistress Calaba! Uh, I-I-I didn’t—[VAR 0114(0012)]
msg_ev035600_talk_09	I owe you an apology.\c\nI treated you with disrespect, thinking you were\njust some whelp from the Diamond Clan.\r\nI’m sorry for that. I should’ve treated you better.[VAR 0114(0011)]
msg_ev035600_talk_10	Huh? Wait. But...[VAR 0114(0012)]
msg_ev035600_talk_11	It’s not your fault that Lilligant became frenzied\nnor that my Ursaluna was so enraged. You were\r\ntrying to help them both, weren’t you?[VAR 0114(0011)]
msg_ev035600_talk_12	I didn’t even have the courtesy to listen to you.\nYou’d think someone who’s lived as long as I\r\nhave would be more patient.[VAR 0114(0011)]
msg_ev035600_talk_13	It’s OK... I didn’t do a good job explaining\nmyself, either.\c\nUrsaluna only started acting weird after he got\ntoo close to Lilligant and smelled her perfume.\c\nShe was already frenzied by that point, so I’m\nsure that’s what caused it...[VAR 0114(0012)]
msg_ev035600_talk_14	Ah, that explains the strange powder I found on\nUrsaluna. It must’ve been powder from Lilligant.\c\nBut what happened to your leg, dear?[VAR 0114(0011)]
msg_ev035600_talk_15	I was gathering ingredients to make balms...\nBut I...I fell and sprained my ankle.[VAR 0114(0012)]
msg_ev035600_talk_16	See, the reason I went to Jubilife was to get help\nfor Ursaluna and also learn about crafting.[VAR 0114(0012)]
msg_ev035600_talk_17	But while I was there, I bumped into Professor\nLaventon, and he told me about the balms you\r\nused to quell Kleavor.\c\nSo I thought I’d make some for Lilligant using her\nfavorite foods...[VAR 0114(0012)]
msg_ev035600_talk_18	You Galaxy people know all sorts of things.\nI’d like to learn even more from you, really...[VAR 0114(0012)]
msg_ev035600_talk_19	Well, then we’d better take care of our lady and\nget all this mess resolved first![VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev035600_talk_20	Adaman![VAR 0114(0012)]
msg_ev035600_talk_21	What were you thinking, doing all this yourself?\nDid you think I couldn’t help you?\c\nThough...no one would blame you for thinking so.\nNot much of a leader, am I? I’ve never even seen\r\nalmighty Sinnoh with my own eyes.\c\nAnd I failed to imagine that Lilligant might have\nbecome frenzied, too...[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev035600_talk_22	[VAR BD06(0000)]Listen up, [VAR 0100(0000)]! I’ll take the\nbalms\r\nthat\r\nArezu\r\nmade\r\nand\r\nmeet\r\nyou\r\nat Brava Arena![VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev035600_talk_23	[VAR BD06(0000)]Don’t you worry, Arezu.\n[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]\r\nwill\r\ncalm\r\nLilligant,\r\nand\r\nthat\r\nwill\r\nbe\r\nthat.\r\nThings\r\nshould\r\nsettle down.[VAR 0114(0011)]
msg_ev035600_talk_24	[VAR BD06(0000)]Head to Brava Arena, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nThat’s\r\nwhere\r\nLilligant’s\r\nseat lies.[VAR 0114(0011)]
msg_ev035600_talk_25	Arezu will be taken care of. My dear Bibarel and I\nwill make sure she reaches her lady.[VAR 0114(0011)]
msg_ev035600_talk_26	You’re all so kind...[VAR 0114(0012)]
msg_evchap03_null_19	[~ 231]
msg_ev035800_talk_01	So, you’ve come. I take it that means\nyou’re ready?[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev035800_list_01	Of course!
msg_ev035800_list_02	Hold on a bit
msg_ev035800_talk_02	Fair enough—you are going up against a noble.\nYou ought to prepare all you can.[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev035800_talk_03	Lady Lilligant’s a sight to see, even in her frenzy.\nBehold her, and be grateful![VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev035800_talk_04	I hope we didn’t keep you waiting.[VAR 0114(0011)]
msg_ev035800_talk_09	All it took was one of my poultices to get Arezu’s\nleg all patched up.[VAR 0114(0011)]
msg_ev035800_talk_05	Calaba, ma’am. I’m deeply sorry we’ve had to\nlean on your help so much—especially as we’re\r\nfrom different clans.[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev035800_talk_06	Arezu tried to solve the whole situation herself.\c\nI daresay she bit off more than she could chew\nand caused some trouble, but her heart was in\r\nthe right place.[VAR 0114(0011)]
msg_ev035800_talk_07	Listen! The Lady of the Ridge, Lilligant, is like a\ndancer—always in motion, always darting about.\c\nYou’ll wanna watch her real close and learn how\nto dodge her moves![VAR 0114(0012)]
msg_ev035800_talk_08	That’s right. If you keep on dodging, she might\nget tired out—and that’ll be your opening!\c\nThat’s when you can bring out your own Pokémon\nand prove your might. Don’t let me down![VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_evchap03_null_20	[~ 243]
msg_ev035820_sys_25	You received the Meadow Plate from Lilligant!
msg_ev035820_talk_01	Hey—thank you.\c\nYou didn’t just save Lilligant—you saved Arezu\nas well. I appreciate it.[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev035820_talk_02	First Ursaluna and now Lilligant! You’re amazing,\nyou know that?[VAR 0114(0012)]
msg_ev035820_talk_03	Being all frenzied didn’t suit Lilligant one bit.\nI’m so happy she’s back to her graceful self.[VAR 0114(0012)]
msg_ev035820_talk_04	Liiilll...
msg_ev035820_talk_05	Arezu! You still owe someone an apology.[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev035820_talk_06	Huh?[VAR 0114(0012)]
msg_ev035820_talk_07	Oh, don’t worry about it.\c\nA young one like her is bound to get caught up in\nsome trouble from time to time.[VAR 0114(0011)]
msg_ev035820_talk_08	Remember what’s written in the Solaceon Ruins?\n“All lives touch other lives to create something\r\nanew and alive.”\c\nThere’s wisdom in those words... I imagine they’re\nthe teaching of almighty Sinnoh itself.[VAR 0114(0011)]
msg_ev035820_talk_09	Of course, I’d completely forgotten about them\nuntil a certain somebody helped me remember.[VAR 0114(0011)]
msg_ev035820_talk_10	We owe you one, ma’am.[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev035820_talk_11	Don’t try to solve everything by yourself, Arezu.\c\nYou’re a warden. Of all people, we should\nknow how to stand in solidarity with others.\r\nIt’s our job to stand side by side with Pokémon,\r\nafter all.[VAR 0114(0011)]
msg_ev035820_talk_12	Yes, I know... I’m sorry...[VAR 0114(0012)]
msg_ev035820_talk_13	Well, I can hardly start yelling at you now after\nCalaba wrapped all that up so nicely.[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev035820_talk_14	Just one more thing, Arezu. I know you were\ntrying to do what you thought was right, and I\r\napprove of that.\c\nBut from now on, do it without keeping things\nfrom me. Agreed?[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev035820_talk_15	Other than that, no need to change a thing.\c\nExcept maybe to put in some training! If anything\nelse happens to Lilligant, I need you ready to\r\nprotect her like the warden you are![VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev035820_talk_16	I understand...[VAR 0114(0012)]
msg_ev035820_talk_17	Let’s work together from now on to keep the\nmirelands safe, Arezu.[VAR 0114(0011)]
msg_ev035820_talk_18	I’ll be sure to inform Irida that both the Diamond\nClan and Galaxy Team helped save Ursaluna.[VAR 0114(0011)]
msg_ev035820_talk_19	[VAR BD06(0000)]You did well, [VAR 0100(0000)]. All our\ndifferent\r\ngroups\r\nfinally\r\njoined\r\nhands\r\nto work\r\ntogether today.\c\nI admit, it was a fun day for me. But now it’s\nabout time I be on my way.[VAR 0114(0011)]
msg_ev035820_talk_20	Listen. You know me—I’m Adaman, leader of the\nDiamond Clan, and I worship almighty Sinnoh,\r\nthe ruler of time.\c\nTime is all about change, and we can’t live in fear\nof that—we can only try to help the time we live\r\nin change for the better.[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev035820_talk_21	Something tells me helping you folks out will help\nme do that. I’m looking forward to it![VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev035820_talk_22	[VAR BD06(0000)]Thank you for everything,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].\r\nI\r\nthink\r\nI’ll\r\nstay\r\nand\r\ntalk\r\nto\r\nLilligant\r\nfor\r\na while.[VAR 0114(0012)]
msg_ev035820_talk_23	What happened, Lilligant? How’d a kindhearted\nPokémon like you end up all frenzied, huh?\c\nThough it’s not like I’m perfect... I hid things\nand lied and couldn’t even keep you safe.\r\nI’m real sorry about everything...[VAR 0114(0012)]
msg_ev035820_talk_24	Liiidiii...
msg_evchap03_null_22	[~ 269]
msg_ev035830_talk_01	You’re a real wonder!\c\nI saw light disappearing into the space-time rift.\nQuelled another frenzied Pokémon, have you?[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev035830_talk_02	We still don’t know what’s causing the lightning\nthat frenzies these Pokémon...\c\nBut you! You just go on rescuing them, without\neven a hint of trepidation![VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev035830_talk_03	You might even change the entire course of\nhistory here in Hisui...\c\nAnd I definitely want to be in the good books\nof someone like that! Let’s stay in touch, friend![VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_evchap03_null_23	[~ 273]

msg_ev035840_talk_02	Remember to be thankful for getting to eat such\nmasterful mochi when you come for dinner later.[VAR 0114(000E)]

msg_ev036000_talk_02	Excellent.[VAR 0114(0009)]
msg_ev036000_talk_03	There may well be times when the Galaxy Team\nwill be forced to fight against Pokémon, but it is\r\nall for the sake of creating a new home for\r\nourselves, free from war and strife![VAR 0114(0009)]
msg_ev036000_talk_04	...A stranger falls into our world from a rift in\nspace-time...\c\nThen frenzies are induced by strange lightning,\nwhich likewise falls from that very same rift...[VAR 0114(0009)]
msg_ev036000_talk_05	But you have no connection to the lightning.\nIsn’t that right?\c\nWe may need to investigate the rift itself to\nprove your motives are beyond impugning.[VAR 0114(0009)]
msg_evchap03_null_25	[~ 283]
msg_ev036020_talk_01	There you go. Piping-hot potato mochi, fresh\nfrom the stove.[VAR 0114(000E)]

msg_ev036020_talk_03	Sure, it’s nice... Yet I keep doing the same thing\nday after day. Is it really getting us anywhere?\r\nWith our research or with carving out a life here?[VAR 0114(0006)]

msg_ev040000_talk_02	Your next orders are to begin the survey of the\nCobalt Coastlands.[VAR 0114(0009)]
msg_ev040000_talk_03	I will let you know in advance—there are no\nPokémon nobles in the Cobalt Coastlands.[VAR 0114(0009)]
msg_ev040000_talk_04	Allow me to explain.[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev040000_talk_05	We did have a lord in the coastlands...until a few\nyears ago. A tragedy took him from us.[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev040000_talk_06	Now, we’ve had reports of people seeing\nstrange, shadowy figures on the island the lord\r\nused to call his home.[VAR 0114(0009)]
msg_ev040000_talk_07	We have also received word from both the\nSecurity Corps and Supply Corps. It seems some\r\nof their members were attacked by a ghost while\r\nout gathering materials around Firespit Island.[VAR 0114(0009)]
msg_ev040000_talk_08	These are serious concerns—and moreover,\nmy clan just can’t tolerate this desecration of our\r\nlate lord’s seat!\c\nNormally, I’d entrust this to our warden in the\ncoastlands, but her situation is...complicated.[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev040000_talk_09	I trust my intentions are clear by now. I hereby\norder you to investigate these reports.[VAR 0114(0009)]
msg_ev040000_talk_12	I’ll meet you in the Cobalt Coastlands. I do love\nit there—it’s a beautiful area.[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev040000_talk_13	Oh, and...I know this must be a bewildering\nsituation to be dropped into.\r\nI’m sorry, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev040000_talk_14	[VAR BD06(0000)]Think nothing of it.\n[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]\r\nis a\r\ntalented\r\nand\r\nhard-working\r\nmember\r\nof the\r\nGalaxy\r\nTeam.\r\nI’m sure\r\n[VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]she will\r\nsort\r\nthings out.[VAR 0114(0009)]
msg_ev040000_talk_15	[VAR BD06(0000)]Indeed. [VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)] quelled\nthe\r\nLord\r\nof the\r\nWoods.\r\nI’ve seen\r\nboth h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]iser\r\nstrength\r\nand h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]iser\r\nkindness firsthand.[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_evchap04_null_03	[~ 45]
msg_ev040200_talk_01	The next area for you to investigate will be the\nCobalt Coastlands.[VAR 0114(0008)]
msg_ev040200_talk_02	It is farther afield than the Crimson Mirelands—\nmuch farther—and the path is long and trying.[VAR 0114(0008)]
msg_ev040200_talk_03	You must be at least a Third Star in our ranks\nto be able to tackle the coastlands.[VAR 0114(0008)]
msg_ev040200_talk_04	Strive to defeat Pokémon in battles, and observe\nthem using particular moves in your survey work.\c\nWork on such research tasks to ready yourself.\nAnd help with any requests that may have been\r\nposted on the professor’s blackboard in his lab.[VAR 0114(0008)]
msg_evchap03_null_30	[~ 50]
msg_ev040210_talk_01	Yes? Have you made progress on your\nresearch tasks?[VAR 0114(0008)]
msg_evchap04_null_02	[~ 52]
msg_ev040220_talk_01	With your current rank, you should be capable\nof braving the Cobalt Coastlands.[VAR 0114(0008)]
msg_ev040220_talk_02	You know your mission. Investigate Firespit Island.[VAR 0114(0008)]
msg_evchap04_null_29	[~ 55]
msg_ev040230_talk_01	[VAR BD06(0000)]Hrrrm! Allow me to reiterate your objective.\c\n[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)], you must survey Firespit\nIsland,\r\nlocated\r\nin the\r\nCobalt Coastlands![VAR 0114(0009)]
msg_evchap04_null_04	[~ 57]
msg_ev040400_talk_01	Ah, if it isn’t [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0010)]
msg_ev040400_talk_02	Though I suppose it’s to be expected that I’d\nrun into you in the village.\c\nWhere are you going to study Pokémon next?[VAR 0114(0010)]
msg_ev040400_list_01	The Cobalt Coastlands
msg_ev040400_list_02	Firespit Island
msg_ev040400_talk_03	Oh, the Cobalt Coastlands? Palina’s certainly in a\nbit of a situation over there.\c\nShe’s a warden, and yet she has no noble to\nsee to.[VAR 0114(0010)]
msg_ev040400_talk_04	Oh, Firespit Island? Perhaps you’ll run into our\nPalina. She’s in a bit of a situation over there.\c\nShe’s a warden, and yet she has no noble to\nsee to.[VAR 0114(0010)]
msg_ev040400_talk_05	There are even some people in the Pearl Clan\nthat speak ill of her, though not to her face.[VAR 0114(0010)]
msg_ev040400_talk_06	Oh, but do forgive me. Perhaps I shouldn’t be\nairing dirty laundry. A piece of advice, then,\r\nas an apology for wasting your time![VAR 0114(0010)]
msg_ev040400_talk_07	Some Pokémon are strongly affected by certain\nstones, which hold mysterious power.\c\nWith the right stone, you can even evolve\nsome Pokémon.\c\nYou need look no further than Kleavor for proof\nof that![VAR 0114(0010)]
msg_ev040400_talk_08	What I’m trying to say is basically this: if you and\nthe Survey Corps want to learn all there is to\r\nknow about the Pokémon of this region...[VAR 0114(0010)]
msg_ev040400_talk_09	then the stones you find throughout Hisui will\nbe very important.\c\nThere’s even a tale of a stone that contains the\npower of creation—the very same power\r\nalmighty Sinnoh used to create the universe![VAR 0114(0010)]
msg_ev040400_talk_10	I trust you’ll take my advice to heart and not\nunderestimate how important stones can be.\c\nTo help grind this fact into you... Here. I’ll give\nyou some rather handy stones and things I found.[VAR 0114(0010)]
msg_ev040400_talk_11	And should you want some stones that can help\nPokémon evolve, I believe the Ginkgo Guild has\r\nthem from time to time![VAR 0114(0010)]
msg_evchap04_null_05	[~ 71]
msg_ev040600_talk_04	Ah, the Cobalt Coastlands! A simply lovely corner\nof Hisui! Sea and sky as far as the eye can see!\c\nWhat kinds of Pokémon await us here, I wonder?\nWater types? Or Flying types, perhaps? Oooh,\r\nI simply can’t wait to study them all![VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_ev040600_talk_01	Now, I’m sure you’re just as excited as I am to\nresearch this area’s Pokémon, but let’s not forget\r\nthat you’ve a mission to accomplish!\c\nSo, any questions before you get started?[VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_ev040600_list_01	About Firespit Island...
msg_ev040600_list_02	About that warden...
msg_ev040600_talk_02	Hmm...indeed. Firespit Island is an offshore\nvolcano—you’ll need to cross the sea to reach it.\r\nI’d advise you to speak to a fellow called Iscan.\c\nHe’s one of the Diamond Clan’s wardens and\nwill surely help you find your way.[VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_ev040600_talk_03	Wardens, in fact!\c\nHere in the Cobalt Coastlands, you’ll find Palina\nof the Pearl Clan and Iscan of the Diamond Clan.\c\nPerhaps they’ll be of some help to you as you\ndig into those curious occurrences.[VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_evchap04_null_07	[~ 78]
msg_ev040800_talk_01	I do love the flute. It feels as if its tones carry to\nthe very ends of space.\c\nBut I am here, and so are you. So now I’m going\nto focus everything I have on battling you![VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev040800_list_01	I’m game!
msg_ev040800_list_02	Why?
msg_ev040800_talk_02	I need to understand my weaknesses. Please do\nthis for me![VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev040800_talk_03	Very good. You who have seen the vast space\nbeyond the rift... Here I come![VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_evchap04_null_31	[~ 84]
msg_ev040810_talk_01	Ah, now I feel better!\c\nThe world is vast...and I am small within it.[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev040810_talk_13	Thank you! Allow me to heal your Pokémon.[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev040810_talk_02	All right. With you... I think with you I can\nbe frank.[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev040810_talk_03	I can’t afford to look weak in front of the\nDiamond Clan’s leader or your commander,\r\nbut in truth...[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev040810_talk_04	I sometimes wonder how I’ve ended up with the\nburdens I bear.[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev040810_talk_05	You see, we have a warden in the coastlands—\na lovely woman named Palina.[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev040810_talk_06	But she tends no lord or lady. And she will not\nraise a successor to fill the late lord’s empty\r\nseat, either.[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev040810_talk_07	Some people have started to question her\nworthiness to be a warden at all.[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev040810_talk_08	But Lina—that is to say, Palina—she’s very dear\nto me, no matter what anyone might say.\c\nWe were both in the running to become leader of\nthe Pearl Clan. We strove to surpass one another,\r\nbut...she taught me a great deal, too.[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev040810_talk_09	Having said all this, I have a favor to ask of you.\c\nPlease help her raise the Pokémon she looks after\ninto a true heir to his father—the late lord![VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev040810_talk_10	With the help of your strength, I think our late\nlord’s heir would grow into a worthy successor.\c\nAnd if he succeeds, it should silence\nLina’s naysayers.[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev040810_talk_11	I don’t know of anyone I’d trust more to help\nwith this than the person who helped the Pearl\r\nClan by quelling Kleavor’s frenzy![VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev040810_talk_12	You’ll be able to find Lina up on the headland.\c\nHead down this hill, and turn left. You should\nfind a slope leading up onto the ridge.[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_evchap04_null_08	[~ 98]
msg_ev041000_talk_01	Grawawa!
msg_ev041000_talk_02	Hush, now. Settle down.[VAR 0114(0004)]
msg_ev041000_talk_03	I’m Palina of the Pearl Clan. And who might\nyou be?[VAR 0114(0014)]
msg_ev041000_talk_04	Ah, so you’re that child from the Galaxy Team.[VAR 0114(0014)]
msg_ev041000_talk_05	I heard how you aided Kleavor and Lilligant\nwhen none other could quell their frenzy.\c\nYour strength must be amazing, and yet...\nyou have such a gentle face.[VAR 0114(0014)]
msg_ev041000_talk_06	So, what brings you to the Cobalt Coastlands?\c\nWe have no lord here, much less a frenzied one\nfor you to quell.[VAR 0114(0014)]
msg_ev041000_talk_07	Our previous lord...was swallowed by the waves.\c\nHe was rescuing his young pup that had been\nswept out to sea and ended up giving his life\r\nto ensure the pup’s safe return...[VAR 0114(0014)]
msg_ev041000_talk_08	If you were to guess, which of these Growlithe\nwould you say is the previous lord’s child?[VAR 0114(0014)]
msg_ev041000_list_01	The big one?
msg_ev041000_list_02	The small one?
msg_ev041000_talk_09	That’s what everyone says at first... But no.[VAR 0114(0014)]
msg_ev041000_talk_10	Oh, you have quite a good eye.[VAR 0114(0014)]
msg_ev041000_talk_11	This quiet, skittish Growlithe is the child of the\nprevious lord.[VAR 0114(0014)]
msg_ev041000_talk_12	Bowww...
msg_ev041000_talk_13	I’ve no doubt this little one has the potential to\nbe a fine lord, but witnessing his father’s demise\r\nhas left deep scars in his heart...[VAR 0114(0014)]
msg_ev041000_talk_14	There are those who expect me to train him more\nstrictly and force lordship upon him before he is\r\nready...but I could never bring myself to do that.[VAR 0114(0014)]
msg_ev041000_talk_15	No matter what the rest of the Pearl Clan says,\nmy mind is quite made up. I’ll stay by this little\r\none’s side and let him live his life as he wishes.[VAR 0114(0014)]
msg_ev041000_talk_16	So, now that you know our situation, might I ask\nyour purpose in coming to the coastlands?[VAR 0114(0014)]
msg_ev041000_list_03	I’m here to help the heir
msg_ev041000_list_04	I make for Firespit Island
msg_ev041000_talk_17	Ah. Did Irida ask you to intervene, perhaps?\c\nI appreciate the kind gesture, truly, but I’m afraid\nthis matter simply does not concern you.[VAR 0114(0014)]
msg_ev041000_talk_18	A survey of Firespit Island? I see... There are\nrumors the place is haunted by strange shadows\r\nthese days.\c\nYou’ll need the aid of a Pokémon known as\nBasculegion if you wish to cross the sea.[VAR 0114(0014)]
msg_ev041000_talk_19	You should speak to Iscan, a warden of the\nDiamond Clan. He should be able to help you.[VAR 0114(0014)]
msg_ev041000_talk_20	There is definitely something strange happening\nout on Firespit Island...\c\nThose shadowy figures are concerning, of course,\nbut then there’s also the odd lightning that came\r\nfrom that rift in the sky...[VAR 0114(0014)]
msg_ev041000_talk_21	Lightning is a sign that the heavens are angry...\nI worry that we may have offended almighty\r\nSinnoh somehow.[VAR 0114(0014)]
msg_ev041000_talk_22	In the past, the Pearl Clan and Diamond Clan\nwere locked in conflict over which side revered\r\nthe true almighty Sinnoh...[VAR 0114(0014)]
msg_ev041000_talk_23	Even if we’ve reached an uneasy peace, the true\nalmighty Sinnoh must be angered because there\r\nare still those who worship a false image of it.\c\nAh, but I digress... I do apologize.[VAR 0114(0014)]
msg_ev041000_talk_24	Iscan lives on Aipom Hill, just past Ginkgo\nLanding. I imagine you’ll find him there.[VAR 0114(0014)]
msg_ev041000_talk_25	Rowww...
msg_evchap04_null_09	[~ 128]
msg_ev041100_talk_01	[VAR BD06(0000)]Why, hello there, M[VAR 1100(00FF,0302)]r.iss [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nFancy\r\nrunning\r\ninto\r\nyou\r\nout here![VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev041100_talk_02	Me? Oh, I’m on the hunt for some plates!\nHow’s your plate hunting going, young friend?[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev041100_list_01	So-so, I guess
msg_ev041100_list_02	Meh...
msg_ev041100_talk_03	No need to be humble! I see you’ve already\ngot your hands on four plates![VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev041100_talk_04	You gain plates when you quell frenzied nobles—\nand when a great Pokémon recognizes you as\r\nworthy of bearing, isn’t that right?[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev041100_talk_05	The way you’ve been collecting those plates...\nIt reminds me of the ancient hero.\c\nThe one that’s said to have battled against\nalmighty Sinnoh.[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev041100_talk_06	You know, I’ve been wondering...\c\nThe 10 Pokémon that are said to have followed\nthe ancient hero—their powers are supposed to\r\nhave come from almighty Sinnoh itself.[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev041100_talk_07	Why would they seek to challenge almighty\nSinnoh along with the hero, then?\c\nPerhaps we’ll get some answers once we gather\nall the plates?[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev041100_talk_08	Well, let’s both do our best to find more!\c\nBut please, don’t overexert yourself. I’d hate\nfor something to happen to one of our guild’s\r\nloyal customers![VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_evchap04_null_15	[~ 139]
msg_ev041200_talk_01	It seems as though nobody’s home...
msg_ev041200_talk_02	Do...do I have a visitor?\c\nI-I’ll be right out... Give me a moment...[VAR 0114(0004)]
msg_ev041200_talk_03	So, um...[VAR 0114(0004)]
msg_ev041200_talk_04	I’m Iscan of...of the Diamond Clan...[VAR 0114(0004)]
msg_ev041200_talk_05	A Galaxy Team member...with a Celestica Flute?\c\nO-oh. You must be [VAR 0100(0000)], right?\c\nH-have I done something to warrant your visit?[VAR 0114(0013)]
msg_ev041200_talk_06	Well, sudden visits give me quite a shock...\nI do hope you’ll give me advanced notice in\r\nthe future.[VAR 0114(0013)]
msg_ev041200_talk_07	So, um...why are you here?[VAR 0114(0013)]
msg_ev041200_list_01	To visit Firespit Island
msg_ev041200_list_02	I need Basculegion’s aid
msg_ev041200_talk_08	So you...you want to go to Firespit Island?\c\nW-well, if you insist...then you’d probably need\nBasculegion’s favorite snack. That should help\r\nhelp him warm up to you.[VAR 0114(0013)]
msg_ev041200_talk_09	But preparing his favorite... Oh... It’s, um, more\nthan a little difficult... More like an impossibly\r\nhigh hurdle... Or...really...just impossible, if I’m\r\nbeing honest...[VAR 0114(0013)]
msg_ev041200_list_03	How so?
msg_ev041200_list_04	Impossible?
msg_ev041200_talk_10	I-I’ll tell you... I have the right materials, but...[VAR 0114(0013)]
msg_ev041200_talk_11	But then you... Well, you see, this next part is\nsomething I could never manage, but you need\r\nto catch this one Pokémon that appears at night...[VAR 0114(0013)]
msg_ev041200_list_05	Go on
msg_ev041200_list_06	Which Pokémon?
msg_ev041200_talk_13	Y-y-you really want to know? You...really don’t\nvalue your own life, do you?[VAR 0114(0013)]
msg_ev041200_talk_14	It’s D...\c\nD...\c\nDus...\c\nDusclops...\c\nOooh, even saying its name fills me with dread...[VAR 0114(0013)]
msg_ev041200_talk_15	So...the materials for the food...have to be\nimbued with flavor by Dusclops’s Dark Pulse...\c\nThat’s the only way you can make Basculegion’s\nfavorite food, you see...[VAR 0114(0013)]
msg_ev041200_list_07	Got it!
msg_ev041200_list_08	I’ll do it!
msg_ev041200_talk_16	W-wow, is everyone in the Galaxy Team like you?\nYour nerves aren’t just steel... They’re...titanium.\c\nIt’s positively frightening how, um, fearless\nyou are.[VAR 0114(0013)]
msg_ev041200_talk_12	D-Dus... Agh, I can’t say it... Well, the Pokémon\nI need has only one eye and can be found\r\nwandering around Deadwood Haunt...\c\nAh, Deadwood Haunt is the area that looks like\na hand on your map... You’ll know you’re there\r\nwhen you find the wrecked boats...\c\nI-I try very hard to avoid those one-eyed\nPokémon, and so now I know a lot about them,\r\nyou see...[VAR 0114(0013)]

msg_ev041415_talk_02	Usually I, um, ask Palina if the Growlithe she\ntakes care of can help me with this bit.[VAR 0114(0013)]
msg_ev041415_talk_03	But this time, you need to help since... Well,\nsince we’re making this snack so that you’ll be\r\naccepted by Basculegion.[VAR 0114(0013)]

msg_ev041415_list_01	Could you get a grip?
msg_ev041415_list_02	Come on—try again
msg_ev041415_talk_08	Right... S-so counting down to it just makes the\nanticipation and terror worse... Let’s simply have\r\nyou do it when I say go...[VAR 0114(0013)]

msg_ev041415_talk_11	Both the aroma and the shape are...perfect!\nIt’s the perfect ball of Basculegion Food!\c\nThen let us make for Ginkgo Landing. We can\nsummon Basculegion there...[VAR 0114(0013)]
msg_evchap04_null_27	[~ 188]
msg_ev041800_talk_01	[VAR BD06(0000)]Oh, hello, [VAR 0100(0000)]...\nI-I was\r\njust\r\nwaiting\r\nfor you...[VAR 0114(0013)]
msg_ev041800_talk_02	Hello, Iscan.[VAR 0114(0014)]
msg_ev041800_talk_03	O-oh, Palina! I...I thought you said we shouldn’t\nbe seen together?[VAR 0114(0013)]
msg_ev041800_talk_04	[VAR BD06(0000)]I’m sure [VAR 0100(0000)]\ncan\r\nkeep\r\na secret.\c\nBesides, both I and the Growlithe pups were\neager to meet with the great Basculegion again.[VAR 0114(0014)]
msg_ev041800_talk_05	I see... Well in that case, let me\nsummon Basculegion.[VAR 0114(0013)]
msg_ev041800_talk_06	Shraaa!
msg_ev041800_talk_07	[VAR BD06(0000)]Go on, [VAR 0100(0000)]. You can\ngive\r\nthe\r\nfood\r\nto\r\nBasculegion now.[VAR 0114(0013)]
msg_ev041800_talk_10	You threw in the ball of Basculegion Food!
msg_ev041800_talk_11	Oh![VAR 0114(0013)]
msg_ev041800_talk_12	Shraaa!
msg_ev041800_talk_13	The great Basculegion...[VAR 0114(0014)]
msg_ev041800_talk_14	O-oh... Thank goodness...\c\nI was a little worried about whether Basculegion\nwould accept this favor...[VAR 0114(0013)]
msg_ev041800_talk_15	[VAR BD06(0000)]So, uh, [VAR 0100(0000)]... You should let\nBasculegion\r\nhear\r\nyour playing.[VAR 0114(0013)]
msg_ev041800_sys_16	Basculegion opened his heart and learned well\nthe sound of your playing!
msg_ev041800_sys_44	You can now call Basculegion and ride across\nthe water on his back!
msg_ev041800_sys_45	You received the Splash Plate from Basculegion!
msg_ev041800_talk_17	Now you can ride Basculegion across Tranquility\nCove and head to Firespit Island.[VAR 0114(0013)]
msg_ev041800_talk_44	You should also know that Basculegion can jump\nfrom the water’s surface—and then jump once\r\nagain in the air to go even higher!\c\nYou can throw items from Basculegion’s\nback, too.[VAR 0114(0013)]
msg_ev041800_talk_45	In your case, I guess that would mean throwing\nPoké Balls to catch Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0013)]
msg_ev041800_talk_18	Grawow!
msg_ev041800_talk_19	[VAR BD06(0000)]My congratulations to you,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0014)]
msg_ev041800_talk_20	Rowrrr...
msg_ev041800_talk_21	Palina... Do you want to tell h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer?[VAR 0114(0013)]
msg_ev041800_talk_22	I mentioned to you before how the previous lord\nrescued his Growlithe pup.[VAR 0114(0014)]
msg_ev041800_talk_23	During that incident, Iscan and Basculegion saved\nmy life as well.[VAR 0114(0014)]
msg_ev041800_talk_24	Since then, I’ve felt a great deal of affection for\nIscan here. I truly adore him...\c\nBut I know there are those who speak ill of me\nbehind my back...[VAR 0114(0014)]
msg_ev041800_talk_25	So I try to meet with Iscan where there are no\nprying eyes, to preserve his reputation.[VAR 0114(0014)]
msg_ev041800_talk_26	W-well, I was just doing what any decent person\nwould do when I saved you...[VAR 0114(0013)]
msg_ev041800_talk_27	Perhaps...but nonetheless. After that day, I found\nthe strength to accept Growlithe as he is and not\r\nforce him to become the next lord.\c\nAnd it was all thanks to the courage you showed\nme, Iscan.[VAR 0114(0014)]
msg_ev041800_talk_28	Ah... Perhaps we should save this discussion for\nanother time, after all.[VAR 0114(0013)]
msg_ev041800_talk_29	Rowrrr...
msg_ev041800_talk_30	I bring good luck to my sisters wherever I go—\nand ill luck to anyone who crosses our paths.\c\nI’m the eldest, and I’ll be your unlucky Charm![VAR 0114(0022)]

msg_ev041800_talk_32	Heads, I win, and tails, you lose—you’ve got no\nchance in this game of fortunes.\c\nI’m the youngest, Coin, but I’m definitely not\nyour good-luck piece.[VAR 0114(0024)]
msg_ev041800_talk_33	We’re the Miss Fortune sisters, known across the\nfrigid land of Hisui—and your luck’s just run out!
msg_ev041800_talk_34	Now get ready to hand over that Growlithe![VAR 0114(0022)]
msg_ev041800_talk_35	You want to take...my partner?\c\nIf your aim is to pester us with bad jokes,\nthose ridiculous introductions of yours were\r\nmore than enough![VAR 0114(0014)]
msg_ev041800_talk_36	Y-yes! Exactly what she said![VAR 0114(0013)]
msg_ev041800_talk_37	Now, Gengar![VAR 0114(0022)]
msg_ev041800_talk_38	Thanks for the Growlithe, fools![VAR 0114(0023)]
msg_ev041800_talk_39	We three can’t live the kind of lives we want\nbecause of narrow-minded groups like the\r\nDiamond Clan and the Pearl Clan.\c\nIf we want to live freely in the great land of Hisui,\nwe need to have powerful Pokémon on our side.[VAR 0114(0022)]
msg_ev041800_talk_40	Don’t worry—we’ll make sure this pup grows up\nnice ’n’ strong. We’ll even make him a lord for ya![VAR 0114(0023)]
msg_ev041800_talk_41	Brawow?!
msg_ev041800_talk_42	Let’s take the mutt to our camp and get to work.\nNo one will bother us in a place so miserably hot.[VAR 0114(0024)]

msg_evchap04_null_13	[~ 234]
msg_ev041820_talk_01	What should we do, [VAR 0100(0000)]?\nThis is an emergency! R-right?[VAR 0114(0013)]
msg_ev041820_talk_02	B-but, uh, you see... I’ve never...I’ve never\nactually had my partner battle before...[VAR 0114(0013)]
msg_ev041820_talk_03	[VAR BD06(0000)]Please, [VAR 0100(0000)]... I beg you:\nhelp us.\c\nThat Growlithe is a very, very dear Pokémon to\nme. Please save him...[VAR 0114(0014)]
msg_ev041820_talk_04	They said they were going to a place where\nnobody would bother them...\c\nThe only place around the Cobalt Coastlands\nthat seems suitable...is Firespit Island.[VAR 0114(0013)]
msg_ev041820_talk_05	Oh! Now that you have Basculegion to help you\ncross the water, you can reach that island, too!\r\nPlease. Could you find it in you to help Palina?[VAR 0114(0013)]
msg_ev041820_list_01	Of course
msg_ev041820_list_02	Well...
msg_ev041820_talk_06	Oh, thank you, thank you! You’re so kind![VAR 0114(0014)]
msg_ev041820_talk_07	We will make our way to Firespit Island as well.[VAR 0114(0014)]
msg_ev041820_talk_08	No, Palina... You should wait here and keep little\nGrowlithe safe.\c\nI’m sure he needs you right now.[VAR 0114(0013)]
msg_ev041820_talk_09	[VAR BD06(0000)]Though...I’m not sure if I want to go to an island\nwith l-lightning and bandits and...\c\nNo! Come, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nNo\r\ntime\r\nto\r\nthink!\r\nWe\r\nmust\r\ngo now![VAR 0114(0013)]
msg_ev041820_talk_10	Honestly...I have to admit I’m still a little scared.\nDo you think you could head over first?[VAR 0114(0013)]
msg_ev041820_talk_11	Iscan is so brave and strong. You can always\nrely on him...[VAR 0114(0014)]
msg_ev041820_talk_12	Rowrrr...
msg_evchap04_null_14	[~ 249]
msg_ev045000_talk_01	Whew... Firespit Island... It’s certainly hot enough\nto feel like a sweat bath, isn’t it?[VAR 0114(0013)]
msg_ev045000_talk_02	And now we’ve got a ghost and bandits to deal\nwith on top of the heat...[VAR 0114(0013)]
msg_ev045000_talk_03	I’m very sorry, but...do you think you could lead\nthe way, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0013)]
msg_ev045000_talk_04	That poor Growlithe... I don’t dare imagine what\nthose bandits are doing to him now...[VAR 0114(0013)]
msg_evchap04_null_16	[~ 254]
msg_ev045200_talk_01	Come on—evolve already![VAR 0114(0022)]
msg_ev045200_talk_02	We’ve done our homework! Any Pokémon gutsy\nenough to come to this lava trap is s’posed to\r\nevolve—so get on with it already![VAR 0114(0023)]
msg_ev045200_talk_03	You WILL become stronger. Like it or not.[VAR 0114(0024)]
msg_ev045200_talk_04	Growow?!
msg_ev045200_talk_05	Oh, look. The pest again.[VAR 0114(0022)]
msg_ev045200_talk_06	Stand back, sisters—I’ll take care of h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer.\nGo, Abomasnow! Smash this fool to pieces![VAR 0114(0023)]
msg_evchap04_null_25	[~ 261]
msg_ev045210_talk_01	Y’know Abomasnow can’t fight at full power in\ncrazy heat like this! It wasn’t a fair battle...\r\nWe were basically goin’ easy on you!\c\nIn fact, how dare you make poor Abomasnow\nbattle in such a stupidly hot place![VAR 0114(0023)]
msg_ev045210_talk_02	You’re the one who sent out Abomasnow, Sister.\c\nGo on, then, Toxicroak. Pour out some poison\nfor our unwelcome guest.[VAR 0114(0024)]
msg_evchap04_null_26	[~ 264]
msg_ev045220_talk_01	I guess I lose the coin toss sometimes...[VAR 0114(0024)]
msg_ev045220_talk_02	I did warn you, didn’t I—that I had a score to\nsettle with the Galaxy Team?\c\nAll the pain and suffering I experienced after\ncoming up here from the Kanto region to work—\r\nI’m going to make you pay for every last slight![VAR 0114(0022)]

msg_ev045230_talk_09	Growlithe! Please, stop! You cannot beat\nsuch foes![VAR 0114(0014)]
msg_ev045230_talk_10	P-Palina?! What are you doing here? I thought\nyou were waiting with little Growlithe...[VAR 0114(0013)]
msg_ev045230_talk_11	I was! But then he jumped into the ocean without\nwarning and swam all the way here...[VAR 0114(0014)]
msg_ev045230_talk_12	Into the ocean?! But he was terrified of the\nocean after it swallowed up the former lord—\r\nhis own father![VAR 0114(0013)]
msg_ev045230_talk_13	Rowrrr...
msg_ev045230_talk_14	Arrroooooo![VAR 0114(0004)]

msg_ev045240_talk_09	Wh-what’s happened to him?[VAR 0114(0014)]
msg_ev045240_talk_10	That strange lightning hit him...\c\nHe’s become frenzied, just like the other nobles!\nOooh, th-this is exactly why I didn’t want to\r\ncome to this island...[VAR 0114(0013)]

msg_ev045240_talk_12	Hey, wait! This is all your fault![VAR 0114(0014)]

msg_ev045250_talk_05	Balms...? Irida, what are you talking about?[VAR 0114(0014)]
msg_ev045250_talk_11	I’m the leader of our clan! Is it so surprising that\nI know a little more of these things than you, Lina?[VAR 0114(000B)]

msg_ev045250_talk_07	Well, uh...in that case, I do always carry some of\nGrowlithe’s favorite foods with me...so I can\r\nthank him when he uses his flames to help\r\nprepare Basculegion’s favorite meal...[VAR 0114(0013)]
msg_ev045250_talk_08	Why, Iscan, once again your thoughtfulness\nsaves the day! Now we can make those balms\r\nright away![VAR 0114(0014)]

msg_ev045410_talk_16	P-please, I do hope you’re joking...\c\nI’m easily scared as it is. What am I to do if I start\nhearing the cries of ghosts all the time?[VAR 0114(0013)]

msg_ev050050_talk_11	Commander, I’m sincerely sorry for this\nheedless interruption![VAR 0114(000A)]

msg_ev050100_talk_03	To take on the highlands, you must achieve the\nrank of Fourth Star or higher. You know how.[VAR 0114(0008)]

msg_ev050200_talk_06	I understand you’ll need a hand from Sneasler\nin order to meet Electrode.[VAR 0114(0015)]

msg_ev051000_talk_02	And up there...\c\nRight beneath that great rift in space-time is the\npeak of Mount Coronet itself!\c\nThe magnetism from it may well exert some\nsort of influence on the Pokémon throughout\r\nthe area. Fascinating stuff![VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_evchap05_null_06	[~ 71]
msg_ev051200_talk_01	The Electrode known as the Lord of the Hollow\nis somewhat different from the Electrode I recall.[VAR 0114(0015)]
msg_ev051200_talk_02	But its electrical discharges, at least, are familiar.\nOne false step around it could put you in danger.[VAR 0114(0015)]
msg_ev051200_talk_03	If you’re going to face it, you might consider\ncatching Pokémon that can withstand electricity.[VAR 0114(0015)]
msg_ev051200_talk_04	It must be difficult being a Pokémon, don’t you\nthink? Especially one as irritable as Electrode.\r\nThen becoming frenzied, to boot...[VAR 0114(0015)]
msg_ev051200_talk_05	So true! It’s a tough old life for Pokémon and\nhumans alike![VAR 0114(0004)]

msg_ev051200_talk_10	We must let my lord frenzy as it may, to\ndemonstrate to almighty Sinnoh that the\r\nDiamond Clan lives as is right and good![VAR 0114(0016)]
msg_ev051200_talk_11	This may even be—dare I say it—the very reason\nI am here on this earth![VAR 0114(0016)]
msg_ev051200_talk_12	What business is it of the Galaxy Team’s, anyway,\nif Electrode lets loose a few sparks out here in\r\nthe mountains?[VAR 0114(0016)]
msg_ev051200_talk_13	Really, you should do us all a favor and slink\nback home to that village of yours, rather than\r\npersist in this folly. And with that...bon voyage![VAR 0114(0016)]
msg_ev051200_talk_14	What a selfish outlook. These frenzies cause the\nPokémon themselves such suffering![VAR 0114(0015)]
msg_ev051200_talk_15	[VAR BD06(0000)]But what is it you want to do,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0015)]

msg_ev051200_talk_16	Very well! The tracks ahead will be perilous, but I\npride myself on safe driving![VAR 0114(0015)]
msg_ev051200_talk_17	Very understandable. But alas, I doubt flouting\nyour commander’s orders will end well.[VAR 0114(0015)]

msg_ev051400_talk_02	Either way, there’s no need for concern. I know\nmy route, and I’ll conduct us safely.[VAR 0114(0015)]
msg_ev051400_talk_03	No darkness nor foul weather will delay us!\nOnward we roll![VAR 0114(0015)]
msg_ev051400_talk_04	Take care not to come uncoupled from me![VAR 0114(0015)]

msg_ev051400_talk_08	Please don’t fall behind!\nWe must keep on schedule![VAR 0114(0015)]
msg_ev051400_talk_09	I can hardly conduct you if you pull so far ahead![VAR 0114(0015)]
msg_ev051400_talk_10	Hurry! We mustn’t separate.[VAR 0114(0015)]
msg_ev051400_talk_11	No more reckless charging off, please.[VAR 0114(0015)]
msg_evchap05_null_24	[~ 109]
msg_ev051420_talk_01	Please forgive the unscheduled stop.[VAR 0114(0015)]
msg_ev051420_talk_02	I detect an alpha Crobat to our right.\c\nUnder normal circumstances, I doubt its presence\nwould obstruct someone so competent as you...[VAR 0114(0015)]
msg_ev051420_talk_03	But given the poor visibility, I propose a track\nchange in the interest of safety. Please follow me.[VAR 0114(0015)]
msg_ev051420_talk_04	I’m starting to recall a man who looked...like me.\nWe’d battle and discuss Pokémon, I think...[VAR 0114(0015)]

msg_ev051440_talk_02	Wait—could those be...?[VAR 0114(0015)]
msg_ev051440_talk_03	Let me put those torches back where they\nbelong. This darkness could be perilous for the\r\nnext person to pass through here.[VAR 0114(0015)]
msg_ev051440_talk_04	I beg your pardon for the delay. I have lit and\nreturned the torches.[VAR 0114(0015)]
msg_ev051440_talk_05	My safety concerns have been addressed.\nReady for departure![VAR 0114(0015)]
msg_ev051440_talk_06	If you follow the track marked by torches, you’ll\nreach the terminus of this cave![VAR 0114(0015)]

msg_ev051600_talk_01	Professor Laventon told me how you fell to this\nland from the sky.[VAR 0114(0015)]
msg_ev051600_talk_02	For my part, I simply found myself one day here\nin Hisui, a region whose name I’d never heard...[VAR 0114(0015)]
msg_ev051600_talk_03	All I could remember was my own name.\c\nI was still standing there in bafflement when the\nPearl Clan came to my aid.[VAR 0114(0015)]
msg_ev051600_talk_04	I showed a natural affinity for taming Pokémon,\nwhich is why I eventually became a warden.\r\nBut still I wonder what my true purpose is here...[VAR 0114(0015)]
msg_ev051600_talk_05	Ah, but now I’ve sidetracked us with this talk.\nLet’s hurry onward![VAR 0114(0015)]
msg_evchap05_null_10	[~ 131]
msg_ev051800_talk_01	What’s the big idea, putting back all the torches\nI spent ages tidying away?\c\nDo you get some sort of amusement stomping\naround and ruining people’s noble deeds?[VAR 0114(0016)]
msg_ev051800_talk_02	Oh? Rendering a cave impassable to people\nwho venture inside hardly seems noble to me.[VAR 0114(0015)]
msg_ev051800_talk_03	Hmph. Well, this just goes to show that even we\nwardens don’t always see eye to eye.\c\nI extinguished those lights for the sake of the\nPokémon in that cave who prefer the dark.[VAR 0114(0016)]

msg_ev051800_talk_12	There’s no shame in a tactical retreat. It’s more of\nan advance, if you think about it!\c\nKeep your guard up—we’ll be back.[VAR 0114(0016)]
msg_ev051800_talk_13	What a lively character.[VAR 0114(0015)]
msg_ev051800_talk_05	I cannot fathom Warden Melli’s intentions... But\nfor now, let us press on![VAR 0114(0015)]
msg_evchap05_null_11	[~ 147]
msg_ev052000_talk_01	This is the Ancient Quarry.[VAR 0114(0015)]
msg_ev052000_talk_02	The stones used to build the temple atop this\nmountain were all cut from this place...[VAR 0114(0015)]
msg_ev052000_talk_03	Whether by humans and Pokémon working as one,\nor by the labor of Pokémon alone, I cannot say.[VAR 0114(0015)]
msg_ev052000_talk_04	The stones that were left behind should serve\nto cover us from the gazes of wild Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0015)]
msg_ev052000_talk_05	Once we’re through here, it will be just a little\nfurther. Let us move with speed...but not haste![VAR 0114(0015)]
msg_evchap05_null_12	[~ 153]
msg_ev052010_talk_01	Ah! There you are, Ingo![VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev052010_talk_02	Volo, was it? What is the matter, sir?[VAR 0114(0015)]
msg_ev052010_talk_03	I wanted to ask about that memory loss of yours.\c\nHave you considered that it could have somehow\nbeen caused by the space-time rift?[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev052010_talk_04	I have no cause to think the rift is to blame...but\nthen again, I hardly remember a thing, so it’s\r\ndifficult to say with certainty.\c\nI can’t remember my own home, nor my family,\nif I had any...[VAR 0114(0015)]
msg_ev052010_talk_05	[VAR BD06(0000)]So you might do better to pose your questions\nto [VAR 0100(0000)], I think, if it’s to do\r\nwith\r\nthat rift.[VAR 0114(0015)]
msg_ev052010_talk_06	Indeed... Well, I do hope your memories return,\nWarden Ingo.[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev052010_talk_07	How about you, then, [VAR 0100(0000)]?\c\nDo you remember what you saw before you fell\nout of that rift? Was there anything inside?[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev052010_list_01	Maybe something...
msg_ev052010_list_02	I saw nothing
msg_ev052010_talk_08	Interesting... You see, personally, I suspect that\nwhatever is on the other side of that rift is\r\ncausing the strange lightning that plagues us.[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev052010_list_03	That makes sense
msg_ev052010_list_04	You think so?
msg_ev052010_talk_09	Indeed! I did some digging and found records\nindicating that this same space-time rift also\r\nappeared in Hisui in the distant past.\c\nThat’s why we already had a name for it as\nit appeared, in fact.[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev052010_talk_10	Now, what kind of world do you suppose\nstretches out on the other side of the rift?[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev052010_talk_11	My guess is that it is almighty Sinnoh’s realm...[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev052010_talk_12	[VAR BD06(0000)]But then that begs the question: Why has the\nspace-time rift reopened, when it closed once\r\nso long ago?\c\nAnd why would [VAR 0100(0000)]\nhave\r\nfallen\r\nthrough to us?\r\nThere’s just so much we don’t know...[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev052010_talk_13	I fervently hope you unravel this mystery, Volo.\c\nI’m sure it would ease people’s fears over the\nfrenzies of our nobles.[VAR 0114(0015)]
msg_ev052010_talk_14	And while you investigate, sir, I’ll continue to\nprioritize the safety of the people living in\r\nthis world.[VAR 0114(0015)]
msg_ev052010_talk_15	Oh, I am a mere admirer of ruins and little more!\nIf something needs investigating, then I would\r\nentrust that task to [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nUntil next time, then![VAR 0114(000C)]

msg_ev052600_talk_10	We have arrived at our destination.[VAR 0114(0015)]
msg_ev052600_talk_01	You would never expect to be able to climb such\nsheer cliffs as these, yes?[VAR 0114(0015)]
msg_ev052600_talk_02	But with Sneasler as an ally, it becomes the work\nof a moment.\c\nShe is so at home on a cliff face, one might think\nshe knew some secret—some hidden move...[VAR 0114(0015)]
msg_ev052600_talk_03	What am I saying? Hidden moves? There are no\nsuch things in Hisui, surely...[VAR 0114(0015)]
msg_ev052600_talk_04	Yet I feel as though I was on the cusp of\nremembering something just now...[VAR 0114(0015)]
msg_ev052600_talk_05	Just who was I before I came to Hisui?[VAR 0114(0015)]
msg_ev052600_talk_06	If you fell from the sky...you come from another\nworld altogether, most likely.\c\nPerhaps a Pokémon battle with you would jog this\nmemory loose...[VAR 0114(0015)]
msg_ev052600_talk_07	[VAR BD06(0000)]Would you honor me with a battle,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0015)]
msg_ev052600_list_01	All right
msg_ev052600_list_02	Maybe not...
msg_ev052600_talk_08	I see. The choice, of course, is yours.[VAR 0114(0015)]
msg_ev052600_talk_09	All aboard, then! Machoke, prepare for departure![VAR 0114(0015)]

msg_ev052610_talk_03	Snawwwr!
msg_ev052610_talk_04	[VAR BD06(0000)]Allow me to introduce you,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].\r\nThis keen-clawed Pokémon is Sneasler.[VAR 0114(0015)]
msg_ev052610_talk_05	Would you be so kind as to play your flute for\nher to hear?[VAR 0114(0015)]
msg_ev052610_sys_06	Sneasler opened her heart and learned well the\nsound of your playing!
msg_ev052610_sys_10	You can now call Sneasler to scale and descend\nsheer cliffs and rock faces!
msg_ev052610_sys_11	You received the Toxic Plate from Sneasler!
msg_ev052610_talk_07	I’m afraid this is my final stop.\c\nPlease proceed up the cliffs with Sneasler’s aid\nand quell the lord up in the mountains![VAR 0114(0015)]
msg_ev052610_talk_08	I will return to Jubilife Village. Please convey my\nwell wishes to Warden Melli.[VAR 0114(0015)]

msg_ev055000_talk_02	I know I’ve not exactly been supportive of you\nreaching this place, but a part of me did hope\r\nyou’d make it.\c\nCall me contradictory all you like, Galaxy grunt,\nbut such is life. Embracing the complexity of both\r\nourselves and the world can only help us grow.[VAR 0114(0016)]
msg_ev055000_talk_03	As a member of the Diamond Clan, my highest\ncalling is to please almighty Sinnoh.\c\nAnd right now, that means I must protect my lord\nby stopping you where you stand![VAR 0114(0016)]

msg_ev055010_talk_01	Let’s make one thing clear: I didn’t lose!\nYou may have won...but there’s a difference![VAR 0114(0016)]
msg_ev055010_talk_25	I just lacked...errr...time! Yes, I’m afraid there\nsimply wasn’t enough time for me to raise my\r\nPokémon nice and strong![VAR 0114(0016)]
msg_ev055010_talk_26	Ah! Could this be why Adaman is always going\non and on about time being a precious thing?!\c\nMy word, the Diamond Clan and almighty Sinnoh\ntruly are never-ending founts of wisdom![VAR 0114(0016)]
msg_ev055010_talk_02	Yes, yes, I know what comes next. You want to\nknow what pleases Lord Electrode so you can\r\nmake some balms for it.[VAR 0114(0016)]
msg_ev055010_talk_03	Well, I’m afraid I won’t be able to help you...[VAR 0114(0016)]
msg_ev055010_talk_04	Because I have completely forgotten what\nElectrode likes![VAR 0114(0016)]
msg_ev055010_talk_05	What’s the matter? Upset? Too bad anger\ndoesn’t make balms![VAR 0114(0016)]
msg_ev055010_talk_06	Melli’s really giving you the runaround, isn’t\nhe, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev055010_talk_07	I guess it’s my fault for not telling you in advance\nwhat Electrode likes. So here’s the—[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev055010_talk_08	Adamaaan![VAR 0114(0016)]
msg_ev055010_talk_09	What now?[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev055010_talk_10	I could hear you just now, you know! Are you\nreally going to tell this little noodle what [VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]she\r\nneeds to find? Just like that?![VAR 0114(0016)]
msg_ev055010_talk_11	Lest we all forget, you’re the leader of the\nDiamond Clan!\c\nWhy do you bother with these Galaxy louts?[VAR 0114(0016)]
msg_ev055010_talk_12	Use your eyes, Melli. Haven’t you even looked at\nyour frenzied lord?\c\nDon’t you feel even a twinge at how it suffers,\nfighting to control the energy that’s bursting\r\nout of it?[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev055010_talk_13	I see nothing but a Pokémon overcome with joy\nat being among almighty Sinnoh’s chosen ones![VAR 0114(0016)]
msg_ev055010_talk_14	Anyway, it’s not like trials and suffering are\nalways cause for doom and gloom.\c\nThese things exist to help us grow![VAR 0114(0016)]
msg_ev055010_talk_15	[VAR BD06(0000)]I’m sorry, Melli. I can’t write off these frenzies\nas some trial from almighty Sinnoh.\c\nThat’s why I’m doing the best I can to help out\n[VAR 0100(0000)] here.\r\nThis\r\nis\r\nbigger\r\nthan\r\nwhat\r\nteam\r\nor\r\nclan\r\nwe\r\nbelong to![VAR 0114(000A)]

msg_ev055010_talk_24	Now it’s time to make some balms. So lend a\nhand—both of you![VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev055200_talk_01	Fine! At the end of the day, let none say that\nthe great Melli shirked his duties as warden.\r\nI’ll help make your precious balms![VAR 0114(0016)]
msg_evchap05_null_19	[~ 225]
msg_ev055400_talk_01	There! I made you a practically infinite supply of\nbalms, so chuck all you like at Electrode.\c\nBut don’t underestimate my lord’s strength!\nI very much doubt the likes of you can quell it.[VAR 0114(0016)]
msg_ev055400_talk_02	So, even knowing you’re doomed to fail, you still\nwish to pit yourself against Electrode?[VAR 0114(0016)]
msg_ev055400_list_01	I’m ready to battle
msg_ev055400_list_02	I’ll pass, thanks
msg_ev055400_talk_03	Heh. You’ve a great deal more pluck than you\nhave sense, I’ll give you that.\c\nA word of advice: don’t stop moving while you’re\nbattling Electrode, or you’ll be dead in no time![VAR 0114(0016)]
msg_ev055400_talk_04	What did I make all these balms for, then? Did\nyou just want to gawk at my skillful handiwork?[VAR 0114(0016)]
msg_ev055400_talk_06	These balm things do smell pretty delightful...[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_evchap05_null_21	[~ 233]
msg_ev055410_sys_21	You received the Zap Plate from Electrode!
msg_ev055410_talk_01	Oh, for shame! What utter calamity...[VAR 0114(0016)]
msg_ev055410_talk_02	I agreed to make those accursed balms, yes...\nBut now that almighty Sinnoh’s precious blessing\r\nhas vanished forever...it’s just so unbearably sad![VAR 0114(0016)]
msg_ev055410_talk_03	Is that how you see it? Electrode looks relieved\nto me. Glad its suffering’s ended, probably.[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev055410_talk_04	Oh, come on, Adaman! Seriously? That’s just\nyour wishful thinking, nothing more.[VAR 0114(0016)]
msg_ev055410_talk_05	All your preaching doesn’t ruffle me one bit, but\nif almighty Sinnoh grows angry with me because\r\nof this...I don’t know what I’ll do![VAR 0114(0016)]
msg_ev055410_talk_06	I arrive, right on schedule![VAR 0114(0015)]
msg_ev055410_talk_07	Now what did YOU bother coming back for?![VAR 0114(0016)]
msg_ev055410_talk_08	[VAR BD06(0000)]Only to say that I recalled some things after\n[VAR 0100(0000)] did me the honor of\r\ntraveling\r\nwith me.[VAR 0114(0015)]
msg_ev055410_talk_09	Things to do with a world where I believe I lived\nbefore my memories were lost.[VAR 0114(0015)]
msg_ev055410_talk_10	Most people there caught Pokémon, lived with\nthem, formed supportive partnerships with them...[VAR 0114(0015)]
msg_ev055410_talk_11	And then there were the Pokémon Trainers...\c\nThe ones we called Pokémon Trainers were truly\ndevoted to their craft.\c\nThey always looked toward the next challenge\nand had Pokémon battles every chance they got,\r\nall to help themselves and their Pokémon grow.[VAR 0114(0015)]
msg_ev055410_talk_12	Through battle, Trainers forged bonds of\nunderstanding with their Pokémon, and with\r\ntheir opponents and their Pokémon, too.\r\nWith everything, I suppose.[VAR 0114(0015)]
msg_ev055410_talk_13	If Pokémon and people work together, we can\nforge new paths forward.\c\nWe’ll be lost to history if we go on believing\nonly Pokémon can be strong—or if we go on\r\nfearing them instead of understanding them.[VAR 0114(0015)]
msg_ev055410_talk_14	Interesting... Was your world like Ingo described\ntoo, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev055410_list_01	It sure was
msg_ev055410_list_02	I don’t remember
msg_ev055410_talk_15	I’d never have thought such a world could exist.[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev055410_talk_16	Pokémon and people working together in close\nharmony, huh...\c\nCould our nobles’ frenzies be some kind of test,\nafter all?\c\nTo see if we can achieve that kind of harmony as\nwe flail around trying to fix things?[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev055410_talk_17	Oh! Once again, the brilliant Warden Melli has\nrealized something rather clever!\c\nIt’s not just my Pokémon that need to be strong—\nit’s me as well! The greater my valor and might,\r\nthe more my Pokémon can reach their potential![VAR 0114(0016)]
msg_ev055410_talk_18	I wonder if almighty Sinnoh will be pleased once\nI’ve achieved exactly that?[VAR 0114(0016)]
msg_ev055410_talk_19	Hey, Adaman! Share with me again the wisdom of\nalmighty Sinnoh passed down among our clan![VAR 0114(0016)]
msg_ev055410_talk_20	All right, all right! Open your ears, shut that big\nmouth, and listen well, my friend!\c\n“Give not into sorrow. Give not into anger.\nOffer only friendship to those around you.\c\n“Give not into sorrow.

msg_ev055420_talk_05	[VAR BD06(0000)]Perhaps with someone like\n[VAR 0100(0000)]\r\nto show\r\nthat\r\nPokémon\r\nneed\r\nnot be\r\nfeared,\r\nthe\r\npeople of\r\nHisui will\r\nfind new\r\ntracks forward.[VAR 0114(0015)]

msg_ev055420_talk_07	Can we find a way to honor our past while also\nforging a better future?\c\nMaybe that’s what almighty Sinnoh really wants\nfrom us. After all, it rules over all time...\r\nand it created everything there is.[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev055420_talk_08	Be ready to shield your eyes, Galaxy grunt!\c\nI’m going to polish up both myself and Electrode\nuntil our strength and brilliance are blinding![VAR 0114(0016)]

msg_ev056000_talk_02	We cannot know if that is the case or not, but\nit does beg the question: Whyever would this\r\n“almighty Sinnoh” drive the nobles to frenzy?[VAR 0114(0009)]
msg_ev056000_talk_03	Is it angered by something? Or does it seek to\ndrive a wedge between people and Pokémon?\c\nWell, far be it from us humans to fathom the\nthoughts of Pokémon...[VAR 0114(0009)]
msg_ev056000_talk_04	And what is that space-time rift, anyway? What\ncaused it to open...?[VAR 0114(0009)]
msg_ev056000_talk_06	Hrrrm. But you must be tired. Go on, then—to\nthe Wallflower. Get some rest while you can.[VAR 0114(0009)]

msg_ev056200_talk_03	This is generous for the boss.[VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev056200_talk_04	Quite a change from the commander’s usual\npreaching about tightening our belts until things\r\ngrow more stable.[VAR 0114(0007)]
msg_ev056200_talk_05	Well, I’ve heard talk that our progress surveying\nPokémon has made gathering ingredients a less\r\nonerous—or at least less dangerous—task.[VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_ev056200_talk_06	But can we talk about how you’ve gone from\nbeing some nobody from nowhere to basically\r\nthe hero of Hisui?[VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev056200_talk_07	It’s almost like a fairy tale, isn’t it—how you’ve\nfallen to us from the sky and gone on to help the\r\npeople of Hisui so much?[VAR 0114(0007)]
msg_ev056200_talk_08	[VAR BD06(0000)]Indeed! Taking on such perilous duties has earned\nyou a great deal of trust,\r\n[VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nIt’s like I always say: “Behavior is a mirror that\nreflects one’s true nature.”[VAR 0114(0005)]

msg_ev056200_talk_03	The Alabaster Icelands are buried in frost and\nsnow. The weak will find no footing there![VAR 0114(0009)]
msg_ev056200_talk_05	Surveying the Pokémon of this frozen reach will\ntake everything the Survey Corps can give.\r\nDo not spare an ounce of effort![VAR 0114(0009)]
msg_ev056200_talk_06	Making headway in the Alabaster Icelands?\nKeep Cyllene apprised of your progress.[VAR 0114(0009)]
msg_evchap06_null_01	[~ 5]
msg_ev060000_talk_01	You handled the situation with Electrode well.[VAR 0114(0008)]
msg_evchap06_null_02	[~ 7]
msg_ev060010_talk_01	You’ve now quelled the frenzy of four nobles.[VAR 0114(0009)]
msg_ev060010_list_01	It wasn’t easy
msg_ev060010_list_02	On to the next one!
msg_ev060010_talk_04	When word of these frenzies arrived from all\nover Hisui, I feared what would become of us.\r\nBut here we are, already preparing to quell the\r\nfinal noble.[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev060010_talk_05	Yeah, who would’ve dreamed some stranger who\ntumbled out of the sky would be our salvation?\r\nLife never does stop surprising you.[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev060010_talk_06	The only lord left to be quelled is Avalugg, which\nlives in the Alabaster Icelands.[VAR 0114(0009)]
msg_ev060010_talk_07	He is also the largest of the nobles, according\nto what Irida told me.[VAR 0114(0009)]
msg_ev060010_talk_08	Your mission is to quell Avalugg, the final lord!\c\nAnd perhaps in doing so, we may trigger some\nchange in the space-time rift as well![VAR 0114(0009)]
msg_ev060010_talk_09	Avalugg may be the Pearl Clan’s noble, but my\nclan and the Galaxy Team will have to step up to\r\nresolve this, too—for the sake of a brighter future![VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev060010_talk_10	Then let us all meet in the cold reaches of the\nAlabaster Icelands. Until then.[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev060010_talk_11	No matter how many of these frenzied Pokémon\nyou may quell, the fact remains that you are\r\na stranger to our world.\c\nNo small number of people still regard you with\nsuspicion and distrust.\c\nThe most you can hope for is to gain the trust\nof as many as possible, and to do that, you must\r\nprove yourself through your actions.[VAR 0114(0009)]
msg_evchap06_null_03	[~ 19]
msg_ev060030_talk_04	Gyah![VAR 0114(0008)]
msg_ev060030_talk_05	A-Abra! Teleport this Wurmple outside! At once![VAR 0114(0008)]
msg_ev060030_talk_01	Ahem.\c\nSo. You’re to survey the Alabaster Icelands next.[VAR 0114(0008)]
msg_ev060030_talk_02	This is the most treacherous clime you’ll face\nin all Hisui.[VAR 0114(0008)]
msg_ev060030_talk_03	If you intend to go, show me you’re equal to the\nchallenge by earning your Fifth Star.[VAR 0114(0008)]
msg_ev060030_talk_06	Witness Pokémon using moves in various styles.\nCatch Pokémon at different times.\c\nComplete such research tasks to raise your rank.\nAnd aid with any requests that might be found on\r\nthe professor’s blackboard.[VAR 0114(0008)]
msg_evchap06_null_12	[~ 26]
msg_ev060040_talk_01	Yes? Have you made progress on your\nresearch tasks?[VAR 0114(0008)]
msg_evchap06_null_14	[~ 28]
msg_ev060050_talk_01	It would not be an exaggeration to say that you\nmight be the only one among the Survey Corps\r\nI can task with surveying the Alabaster Icelands.[VAR 0114(0008)]
msg_evchap06_null_16	[~ 30]
msg_ev060060_talk_01	You know your orders. See your mission through.[VAR 0114(0008)]
msg_evchap05_null_04	[~ 32]
msg_ev060080_talk_01	So, we’re to make for the Alabaster Icelands?[VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_ev060080_list_01	That’s right
msg_ev060080_list_02	Not quite yet
msg_ev060080_talk_02	I see...\c\nOf course I’m all too aware of the injuries done\nto some of our own good people because of\r\nthe frenzies of the other nobles.\c\nThere seemed little choice but to intervene...[VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_ev060080_talk_03	But this Avalugg out in the Alabaster Icelands\nhasn’t harmed a soul, as I hear it.\c\nDoes it really behoove us to go out of our way\nto subdue him?[VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_ev060080_talk_04	If Avalugg’s as huge and strong as they say, there’s\na good chance he could start an avalanche.[VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev060080_talk_04_m	If Avalugg’s as great and mighty as they say, he\ncould very well cause avalanches...[VAR 0114(0007)]
msg_ev060080_talk_05	Avalanches don’t require any Pokémon’s help.\nThey occur perfectly well on their own, you know.[VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_ev060080_talk_06	[VAR BD06(0000)]I confess I still have my doubts whether we\nshould even be getting involved in this case.\c\nNo damage has been done so far, but if we send\n[VAR 0100(0000)] out there, we’ll be\r\nputting\r\nh[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer\r\nin danger\r\nof\r\nreal harm![VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_ev060080_talk_07	But people say the frenzies make the nobles\nsuffer, right?\c\nSo wouldn’t it be a kindness for us to quell\nthe lord?[VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev060080_talk_07_m	But if the lord is suffering in its frenzy like people\nsay, then wouldn’t it be kinder to quell it?[VAR 0114(0007)]
msg_ev060080_talk_08	There’s simply so much we don’t yet understand\nwhen it comes to the noble Pokémon...\c\nWe don’t know whether their frenzies truly are\ncausing them to suffer, nor do we know why they\r\nenter these states in the first place or if this is all\r\nconnected somehow to the space-time rift.[VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_ev060080_talk_09	What is it, I wonder, that the commander hopes\nwill come about from our quelling the nobles?\c\nOr, indeed, from surveying any of the Pokémon\nof this land? What is it he hopes to achieve...?[VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_ev060080_list_03	A way to coexist?
msg_ev060080_list_04	Protecting everyone?
msg_ev060080_talk_10	I certainly hope so.\c\nThe goal of my research is to help build a future\nwhere everyone gets along with Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_ev060080_talk_11	Indeed, the better we understand our Pokémon\nneighbors, the safer we’ll all feel and be.\c\nBut if the real goal of this mission is to quell a\nnoble for quelling’s sake, rather than for the\r\nsake of scientific study, then...[VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_ev060080_talk_12	Professor...?[VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev060080_talk_12_m	Professor Laventon...?[VAR 0114(0007)]
msg_ev060080_talk_13	[VAR BD06(0000)]Ah! Nothing to bother yourselves about!\nDoubtless I’m just being a silly sausage.\c\nYou’ve got a mission to carry out, haven’t you,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]? Then we will support\r\nyou\r\nin it.[VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_ev060080_talk_14	How about I offer my support by giving you\nanother shot at honing your battle skills?[VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev060080_list_05	I’m gonna win
msg_ev060080_list_06	I’d better not
msg_ev060080_talk_16	Look, I know better than anyone how good you\nare. And I’m still the one asking for a battle!\c\nSo come on—give me a shot against you![VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev060080_talk_17	Yeah, but I’m still glad to get to battle you.\nI owe you a lot, you know.\c\nIf you hadn’t tumbled down to us, I might never\nhave learned to battle alongside Pikachu![VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev060080_talk_14_m	The best support I can offer you now is another\nchance to practice your battle skills.[VAR 0114(0007)]
msg_ev060080_list_07	I’m gonna win
msg_ev060080_list_08	I’d better not
msg_ev060080_talk_16_m	I may not be able to beat you, but there’s always\nsomething to be learned from seeing how battle\r\nunfolds between different Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0007)]
msg_ev060080_talk_17_m	I’m glad just to get the opportunity to battle you.\c\nThe fact that I’ve been able to grow so much\nas a Survey Corps member and work together\r\nwith Pikachu is due to you joining us.[VAR 0114(0007)]
msg_evchap06_null_17	[~ 63]
msg_ev060090_talk_01	Good luck on your mission in the icelands.\c\nThis sounds like it’ll be a perilous one, dealing\nwith a huge Pokémon like Avalugg...[VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev060090_talk_01_m	About your mission in the icelands... Well, it will\nbe a challenge. Be careful out there.[VAR 0114(0007)]
msg_ev060090_talk_02	As for me, I’ll set off for the Alabaster Icelands\nforthwith! See you there, my [VAR 1100(00FF,0403)]boygirl![VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_evchap06_null_04	[~ 67]
msg_ev060100_talk_01	My word, it’s rather chilly here, isn’t it? Glad to\nsee you made it safe and sound, in any case.[VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_ev060100_talk_02	Very few venture to these Alabaster Icelands—\napart from Tao Hua leading the odd Supply\r\nCorps excursion to gather materials.[VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_ev060100_talk_03	But the Survey Corps, of course, must go\nanywhere that Pokémon are found![VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_ev060100_talk_04	From what I gather, Icepeak Arena—where you’ll\nfind Avalugg—is rather far off, I’m afraid![VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_ev060100_talk_05	Doubtless this mission to tackle Avalugg will\nbe another dangerous one.\c\nLearn all that you can from Irida and Adaman\nto try to keep yourself safe.[VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_evchap06_null_05	[~ 73]
msg_ev060150_talk_01	[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]! Brisk out here, isn’t it?[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev060150_talk_02	How aren’t you freezing?[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev060150_talk_03	Freezing? I’m practically sweating.\c\nIf you think this is bad, just wait. This is nothing\ncompared to where we’re headed.[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev060150_talk_04	You know, I’m beginning to think the problem\nbetween us isn’t a Diamond Clan thing or a Pearl\r\nClan thing. It’s just a you-and-me thing.\c\nWe’ll never see eye to eye on anything, will we?[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev060150_talk_05	I don’t see how we could, as long as you and\nyour clan cling to your vision of an almighty\r\nSinnoh that reigns over time.\c\nForgive my bluntness, but if such a being even\ndoes exist, it’s certainly not almighty Sinnoh.[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev060150_talk_06	Yes, yes. Believe what you want. Just tell us\nwhere we have to go.[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev060150_talk_07	We’re headed to see my teacher. And he’s only\never found in one place.[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev060150_talk_08	Which is?\c\nYou’re talking about that Gaeric fellow, right?\nWhere do we find him?[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev060150_talk_09	At Avalugg’s Legacy, obviously! Where else but a\ngreat mass of ice could I have meant when I said\r\nwe’d be headed somewhere even colder?[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev060150_talk_10	Where else, indeed.\c\nReady to go, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev060150_talk_11	Sure! Stomp off without me!\c\nThis is why I can’t stand people who only care\nabout whether time is passing them by![VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev060150_talk_12	[VAR BD06(0000)]See you at Avalugg’s Legacy,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]!\r\nTake care on your way![VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_evchap06_null_11	[~ 86]
msg_ev060200_talk_01	Well, that was a real slog, fighting through those\nmiserable icy winds to reach this desolate bit of\r\nnowhere. Well done, us.[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev060200_talk_02	This gentleman is Avalugg’s warden and my\nmost honorable teacher, Gaeric.\c\nSo show some respect, Adaman![VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev060200_talk_03	Let’s begin with some proper introductions![VAR 0114(0004)]
msg_ev060200_talk_04	I am Gaeric. I serve as one of the Pearl\nClan’s wardens.[VAR 0114(0017)]
msg_ev060200_talk_05	And you must be [VAR 0100(0000)], right?\nOf the Galaxy Team.[VAR 0114(0017)]
msg_ev060200_talk_06	Answer me this, would you? On what grounds do\nyou come here seeking to quell Lord Avalugg?[VAR 0114(0017)]
msg_ev060200_list_01	He’s in a frenzy
msg_ev060200_list_02	I was commanded to
msg_ev060200_talk_07	That leads to my next question: What is wrong\nwith him being frenzied?[VAR 0114(0017)]
msg_ev060200_list_03	It could trouble others
msg_ev060200_list_04	I don’t know
msg_ev060200_talk_08	Then I have another question: Setting aside any\norders, what is it your heart tells you to do?[VAR 0114(0017)]
msg_ev060200_list_05	To quell his frenzy
msg_ev060200_list_06	I don’t know
msg_ev060200_talk_09	Our mighty Lord of the Tundra, Avalugg, has\ndone nothing to trouble any person or Pokémon![VAR 0114(0017)]
msg_ev060200_talk_10	Sir! Please try to keep your cool![VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev060200_talk_11	For now, indeed, Avalugg’s causing no trouble.\c\nBut aren’t we also duty bound to free our people\nfrom living in fear that such a colossal Pokémon\r\nmight begin to wreak havoc at any moment?[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev060200_talk_12	We are. There’s certainly some logic to that.\nBut if that is what you hope to accomplish, then\r\nwe must judge whether this child is up to the task![VAR 0114(0017)]
msg_ev060200_talk_13	Who cares about the grandstanding? Let’s get\nto battling![VAR 0114(0017)]
msg_ev060200_list_07	Let’s start!
msg_ev060200_list_08	Let’s not
msg_ev060200_talk_14	Then you will never earn my approval! If you\nwon’t allow me to test your mettle, all there is for\r\nme to do is resume my training![VAR 0114(0017)]
msg_ev060200_talk_15	My musculature is as hard and unyielding as ice!\nThink you can break through?![VAR 0114(0017)]
msg_ev060200_talk_16	Come on—show him what you’re made of, or\nwe’ll never get anywhere.[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev060200_talk_17	Gaeric’s Pokémon are as hard and unyielding as\nhis musculature![VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_evchap06_null_21	[~ 112]
msg_ev060210_talk_01	Outstanding! I’m tough as an iceberg, but you\nsmashed me through and through![VAR 0114(0017)]
msg_ev060210_talk_02	I suppose you all can get on with it now. This\none’s all right![VAR 0114(0017)]
msg_ev060210_talk_03	[VAR BD06(0000)]Thank you, sir!\c\nSome may still have their doubts about a stranger\nlike [VAR 0100(0000)], but I’ll vouch\r\nfor h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer![VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev060210_talk_04	Then if you insist on quelling Avalugg’s frenzy,\nyou’ll want to claim some of that Eternal Ice\r\nhe likes and bring it to my lord’s seat. Good luck![VAR 0114(0017)]
msg_ev060210_talk_05	Eternal Ice, is it? For that, you’ll have to be able\nto fly—which means you need Braviary.\c\nLong story short: you’ve got to seek out a young\nlady named Sabi![VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev060210_talk_06	Tell the long story long! You’re not saving any\ntime if we waste it puzzling out what you mean![VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev060210_talk_07	Isn’t Avalugg one of the Pearl Clan’s lords?\nSeems a bit odd for me to do the talking...[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev060210_talk_08	But fine. Listen up: This Eternal Ice stuff can be\nfound atop Avalugg’s Legacy here.[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev060210_talk_09	But to get there, you’ll need my clan’s help.\c\nNot even Sneasler can climb this surface, let\nalone a person, like you or me. You’re going to\r\nhave to approach by air—with Braviary’s help.[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev060210_talk_10	Gaeric once managed to climb nearly to the top\nof Avalugg’s Legacy, I’ll have you know.\c\nHe says he made it to within six feet of the\ntop. Might makes right—or at least height![VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev060210_talk_11	And, uh, about Sabi... How do I put this?\nEven when she’s not flying with Braviary, she’s got\r\nher head in the clouds.\c\nWell, you’ll understand once you meet her.\nHead toward Snowpoint Temple, and you’ll\r\nprobably come across her sooner or later.[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev060210_talk_12	Wha—?![VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev060210_talk_13	Sabi![VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev060210_talk_14	My clairvoyance told me...that I’d lead you on\na chase!\c\nThink you can reach me?[VAR 0114(0018)]
msg_ev060210_talk_15	I see what you meant about Sabi... But why would\nshe be up there?[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev060210_talk_16	Seems you better focus on pursuing Warden Sabi.\nAnd let me focus on my workout while I still can![VAR 0114(0017)]
msg_ev060210_talk_17	So, yep...that’s Sabi. Good luck![VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_evchap06_null_06	[~ 130]
msg_ev060400_talk_02	Hello, my name’s Sabi![VAR 0114(0018)]
msg_ev060400_talk_01	Nice to meet you, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0018)]
msg_ev060400_list_01	Same to you
msg_ev060400_list_02	Pleasure’s all mine
msg_ev060400_talk_03	I’ve heard about you. You’re super talented,\nright? I bet you’re gonna be fun to play with![VAR 0114(0018)]
msg_ev060400_talk_04	I know why you’re here, too!\c\nYou want Braviary’s help so you can quell\nAvalugg’s frenzy, don’t you?[VAR 0114(0018)]
msg_ev060400_talk_05	Well, you’ll get it...[VAR 0114(0018)]
msg_ev060400_talk_06	if you can catch me first![VAR 0114(0018)]
msg_ev060400_talk_07	Let’s go, Braviary![VAR 0114(0018)]
msg_evchap06_null_07	[~ 140]
msg_ev060600_talk_01	[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0018)]
msg_ev060600_talk_02	You made it all the way up here in this cold![VAR 0114(0018)]
msg_ev060600_talk_03	But the question is...did you catch me? Or did I\nlet myself get caught? Hmmm?[VAR 0114(0018)]
msg_ev060600_talk_05	Oooh, and one more thing: Am I even\nreally clairvoyant?[VAR 0114(0018)]
msg_ev060600_list_01	You might be
msg_ev060600_list_02	No idea
msg_ev060600_talk_06	Hmm. No one but me could really know, right?\c\nAnyway, the challenge continues. The next stop\nof our merry chase is Snowpoint Temple![VAR 0114(0018)]
msg_ev060600_talk_07	But the real question here is...am I really having\nfun playing with you? Or am I bored? Hmmm?[VAR 0114(0018)]
msg_ev060600_talk_04	Let’s go, Braviary![VAR 0114(0018)]
msg_evchap06_null_08	[~ 150]
msg_ev060800_talk_01	Hi again, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0018)]
msg_ev060800_talk_02	It’s nice having someone new out here to play\nwith. Safety in numbers or something like that![VAR 0114(0018)]
msg_ev060800_talk_03	Anyway, here’s Snowpoint Temple! I’ve opened\nthe front door for you. Just a little more chasing\r\nleft for you to do![VAR 0114(0018)]
msg_ev060800_talk_04	But the real question here is...am I really having\nfun playing with you? Or am I bored? Hmmm?[VAR 0114(0018)]
msg_ev060800_talk_05	The only ones who may enter Snowpoint Temple\nare those of the Pearl Clan...and Sabi of the\r\nDiamond Clan, for some reason.
msg_ev060800_talk_06	I heard what Warden Sabi said.\c\nIf you have Warden Sabi’s approval to enter,\nthen by all means, do so.\c\nBut be warned! Those who cannot solve the\ntemple’s puzzles won’t get very far within.
msg_ev060800_talk_80	I’ve heard that the trick is to pay attention to\nwhich way the stone statues are looking.
msg_ev060800_talk_81	Come to think of it, I believe the statues have\nsome sort of patterns on their chests, too...
msg_evchap06_null_23	[~ 159]
msg_ev062000_talk_01	I guess I’ve been caught, so we’re nearly done...\nThat’s no fun.[VAR 0114(0018)]
msg_ev062000_talk_02	Hey, remember my clairvoyance? It showed me\nsomething else.\c\nI saw you flying with Braviary. Do you think that’ll\ncome to pass?[VAR 0114(0018)]
msg_ev062000_list_01	I’ll make sure it does
msg_ev062000_list_02	I don’t know
msg_ev062000_talk_03	Well, however the future turns out...flying with\nBraviary isn’t easy![VAR 0114(0018)]
msg_ev062000_talk_04	If you really want to be able to fly high in the sky,\nprove to me you’re strong enough![VAR 0114(0018)]
msg_ev062000_talk_05	Gonna take us on?[VAR 0114(0018)]
msg_ev062000_list_03	Yup
msg_ev062000_list_04	Hang on
msg_ev062000_talk_06	Now, get ready, ’cause here come Rhyperior,\nMagmortar, and Electivire—all three of ’em! Go![VAR 0114(0018)]
msg_ev062000_talk_07	That’s one loss! Next up, please![VAR 0114(0018)]
msg_ev062000_talk_08	Another loss! Next-next up, please![VAR 0114(0018)]
msg_ev062000_talk_09	You got cold feet now? After chasing me all the\nway here?[VAR 0114(0018)]
msg_ev063000_talk_14	[~ 173]
msg_ev062010_talk_01	Wow, you caught us AND you beat us. You’ve\nwon all our games so far!\c\nBut Braviary still wants to get to know you even\nbetter. Up to the roof we go![VAR 0114(0018)]
msg_ev063000_talk_13	[~ 175]
msg_ev063000_talk_01	Grawk! Grauwk!
msg_ev063000_talk_02	[VAR BD06(0000)]All right, Braviary! Why not test out\n[VAR 0100(0000)]’s\r\nstrength\r\nfor yourself?[VAR 0114(0018)]
msg_ev063000_talk_12	[~ 178]
msg_ev063020_talk_01	Grrr! I can’t believe Braviary lost!\c\nBut that’s that. Thanks for playing with me.\nGuess I’ll head home now. Byeee![VAR 0114(0018)]
msg_ev063020_list_01	Hey!
msg_ev063020_list_02	Wait!
msg_ev063020_talk_02	I was kidding.[VAR 0114(0018)]
msg_ev063020_talk_03	Play along with me on your flute![VAR 0114(0018)]
msg_ev063020_sys_04	Braviary opened his heart and learned well the\nsound of your playing!
msg_ev063020_sys_20	You can now call Braviary and glide through the\nair with him!
msg_ev063020_sys_05	You received the Sky Plate from Braviary!
msg_ev063020_talk_06	Thanks, Sabi.[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev063020_talk_07	[VAR BD06(0000)]Sure. Having [VAR 0100(0000)] to fly\naround\r\nwith\r\nshould\r\nbe\r\nfun\r\nfor Braviary.[VAR 0114(0018)]
msg_ev063020_talk_08	Yeah? I’m glad. A world where people and\nPokémon live and work together, huh...[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev063020_talk_09	Tell me—why do you think the lightning that\ncomes from the rift would cause these frenzies?[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev063020_talk_10	Do you think this is all almighty Sinnoh’s anger?\nOr do you think this is a trial it’s putting to us?[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev063020_talk_11	If it is a trial—if we prove ourselves worthy,\nand we quell the last noble, calm Avalugg...\r\nthen the rift really ought to close. Right?[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev063020_talk_12	Even if the one who seems to be clearing this\ntrial is a newcomer like you, not one of us who’ve\r\nbeen living here in Hisui for ages now.[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev063020_talk_13	How come you’re playing all wise? I thought you\nweren’t a big thinker, Adaman.[VAR 0114(0018)]
msg_ev063020_talk_14	Hush, Sabi! I can feel history on the move.[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev063020_talk_15	And as far as I can see, the one ushering in this\nnew era is you.\c\nSo if I stick with you, someday I might get to\nmeet almighty Sinnoh myself![VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev063020_talk_16	The question is...does listening to Adaman\nfascinate you? Or bore you to tears? Hmmm?[VAR 0114(0018)]
msg_ev063020_talk_17	[VAR BD06(0000)]Anyway, [VAR 0100(0000)]... It’s time for\nyou\r\nto go\r\nsoar\r\nwith Braviary![VAR 0114(0018)]
msg_ev063020_talk_18	If you jump from way up here, Braviary can take\nyou gliding just about anywhere![VAR 0114(0018)]
msg_ev063020_talk_19	But don’t forget to get the Eternal Ice. That’s why\nyou needed Braviary in the first place, right?[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev063020_talk_20	Avalugg’s Legacy is down there![VAR 0114(0018)]
msg_ev063020_talk_21	Now go get a feel for flying with Braviary. When\nyou’re done soaring the skies and want to land,\r\njust ask him to dive![VAR 0114(0018)]
msg_evchap06_null_13	[~ 203]
msg_ev065000_talk_01	Your Arc Phone is beeping...
msg_ev065000_talk_02	You obtained the Eternal Ice!
msg_ev065000_talk_03	Wahahaha![VAR 0114(0017)]
msg_ev065000_talk_04	At last, this summit is conquered![VAR 0114(0017)]
msg_ev065000_talk_05	And I see you made it, too![VAR 0114(0017)]
msg_ev065000_talk_06	Flew down to this place and obtained the\nEternal Ice, did you? What drives that burning\r\nzeal of yours, I wonder.[VAR 0114(0017)]
msg_ev065000_talk_07	You gave Gaeric the Eternal Ice!
msg_ev065000_talk_09	I do have to respect the effort you’ve put in.[VAR 0114(0017)]
msg_ev065000_talk_10	I may still have my own doubts weighing on my\nmind, but I will make the necessary preparations\r\nso that you can face my lord, Avalugg.\c\nMeet me at Icepeak Arena.[VAR 0114(0017)]
msg_ev065000_talk_11	Now, don’t try to repeat the wondrous feat\nyou’re about to see me perform!\c\nA tall leap like this can only be managed by\nhighly toned bodies like mine![VAR 0114(0017)]
msg_ev065000_talk_12	Till next we meet![VAR 0114(0017)]
msg_evchap06_null_15	[~ 215]
msg_ev065100_talk_01	Why, if it isn’t [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nWhat a pleasure, finding a familiar face—or any\nface—in this far corner of the Alabaster Icelands.[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev065100_talk_02	I came to bring Gaeric an order of Swordcaps,\nand he was more than willing to have a chat\r\nabout Avalugg![VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev065100_talk_03	What do you say? Interested in a bit of gossip?[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev065100_list_01	Absolutely!
msg_ev065100_list_02	Not really
msg_ev065100_talk_04	And why wouldn’t you be![VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev065100_talk_05	Oh, have some mercy! Can’t you see I’m dying to\ntell you what I’ve learned?\c\nWell, I’ll tell you anyway.[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev065100_talk_06	So, Avalugg, yes? The fifth of Hisui’s nobles...[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev065100_talk_07	That he is! And you know what? He’s an\nabsolute beast![VAR 0114(0017)]
msg_ev065100_talk_08	Well, yes. According to what I was told, not only\ndoes he barrage you with chunks of ice—he also\r\nfires off massive icicles, and he can cause sharp\r\nice crystals to erupt from the ground below you!\c\nDoesn’t that seem a bit too powerful to take on?[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev065100_talk_09	What’s more, apparently the Avalugg of old\ncould be up to a hundred feet tall.\c\nDoesn’t that seem a bit too big to take on?[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev065100_talk_10	Oh, you’ll be all right! You just have to eat some\nSwordcaps, then give your training your all—\r\nnothing better for building muscle than that.\c\nOnward now—to the arena![VAR 0114(0017)]
msg_ev065100_talk_11	Hmm, yes, well, I did want to see that Avalugg\nbut perhaps not at the cost of my life.\c\nSo I suppose my freezing digits and I will be off![VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_evchap06_null_09	[~ 229]
msg_ev065400_talk_01	So we are to quell Avalugg, as you wished...\nIn the end, the strength of your feelings won out.\c\nOr maybe your real strength comes from the way\nthat you walk among both people and Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0017)]
msg_ev065400_talk_02	Well! I suppose I’d better get to work making\nsome balms using that Eternal Ice.\c\nI’ve heard how they are made, and with muscles\nlike mine, it’ll be only a moment’s work![VAR 0114(0017)]
msg_ev065400_talk_03	And there you have it![VAR 0114(0017)]
msg_ev065400_talk_04	If you truly wish to quell Avalugg, then walk on.\nThe path lies before you!\c\nBut know that Avalugg will hurl chunks of ice at\nyou without relent!\c\nYou’ll need unrivaled dodging ability![VAR 0114(0017)]
msg_ev065400_list_01	I’m going
msg_ev065400_list_02	Maybe later...
msg_evchap06_null_18	[~ 236]
msg_ev065410_sys_23	You received the Icicle Plate from Avalugg!
msg_ev065410_talk_01	Gaeric, sir, you needn’t look quite so downcast...[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev065410_talk_02	[VAR BD06(0000)]B-but seeing mighty Avalugg quelled—and by\nsuch a slight child...\c\nA child that fell from the very sky...\c\nIs this [VAR 0100(0000)] [VAR 1100(00FF,0403)]boygirl\nsome\r\nkind\r\nof\r\nmonster\r\nin disguise?![VAR 0114(0017)]

msg_ev065410_talk_04	[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]...\c\nGaeric cares for the Pearl Clan with all his heart\nand believes in almighty Sinnoh just as deeply.[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev065410_talk_05	So he has feared more than any of us that\ngetting involved with the Diamond Clan and your\r\nGalaxy Team could cause our people to flag\r\nin their devotion to almighty Sinnoh.[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev065410_talk_06	But that will change.[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev065410_talk_07	Irida...?[VAR 0114(0017)]
msg_ev065410_talk_08	[VAR BD06(0000)]I know your fears will change once you see what\nI’ve seen. [VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]\r\nhas\r\nmuch\r\nto\r\nteach us.\c\n[VAR 1100(00FF,0201)]HShe’s shown us how we can overcome all manner\nof strife, so long as our Pokémon are with us![VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev065410_talk_09	[VAR 1100(00FF,0201)]HShe’s made me want to help Glaceon realize\ngreater strength as well—and to see my whole\r\nworld grow broader![VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev065410_talk_10	It seems you’ve already changed, Irida.[VAR 0114(0017)]
msg_ev065410_talk_11	[VAR BD06(0000)]I knew you could pull that off,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev065410_talk_12	You quelled every last frenzied noble!\c\nSo is that space-time rift going to start closing\nup now or what?[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev065410_talk_13	There’s little way of knowing for sure. Though the\nrift does seem perhaps a little smaller, somehow.[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev065410_talk_14	Let’s hope so, anyway.[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev065410_talk_15	[VAR BD06(0000)]Well, with any luck, things will settle down now...\c\nAlthough even if the rift does start spitting out\nmore of that strange lightning, we should still be\r\nall right as long as we’ve got\r\n[VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev065410_talk_16	Indeed we should be. It’s good to have h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer at\nour side.[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev065410_talk_17	You know something, Irida?\c\nWe may never agree on who’s got it right about\nalmighty Sinnoh, but you Pearl Clan folk aren’t all\r\nbad in my book.[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev065410_talk_18	Look who’s finally seen reason![VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev065410_talk_19	Anyway, now that we’ve quelled the last noble...\c\nI say we pay grim old Commander Kamado a visit\nand see if he’ll finally crack a smile for us![VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev065410_talk_20	What’re you going to do now that all the nobles\nhave been quelled, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev065410_talk_21	You quelled Avalugg...\c\nWe may not yet know for sure if it was right or\nnot to do so, but it was certainly a fine battle![VAR 0114(0017)]
msg_ev065410_talk_22	Seeing you take on Avalugg was intense, even\nfrom up in the sky where I was watching![VAR 0114(0018)]
msg_evchap06_null_19	[~ 260]
msg_ev067000_talk_01	Each of the Pokémon nobles became frenzied...\nand now each of them has been quelled.[VAR 0114(0009)]
msg_ev067000_talk_02	We still have no explanation for why this calamity\nbefell us, but I’m glad to see it put to an end.[VAR 0114(0009)]
msg_ev067000_talk_03	And to think peace would be restored to Hisui by\nthe hand of our mysterious rift-borne helper...[VAR 0114(0009)]
msg_ev067000_talk_04	When tomorrow dawns, it will dawn on a world\nrestored to normalcy. At long last, we will be able\r\nto return to our normal lives.[VAR 0114(0009)]
msg_ev067000_talk_05	Go nourish yourself at the Wallflower, and allow\nyourself a good, long rest.\c\nDon’t forget—the Survey Corps’ work is not over.\nIt does not end until our people can live here in\r\nHisui without fearing the Pokémon around us.[VAR 0114(0009)]
msg_evchap06_null_20	[~ 266]
msg_ev068000_talk_01	Thanks for this nice, sizeable helping of potato\nmochi, Beni, old chum!\c\nOh, and if there’s anything else that you’d\nrecommend, by all means, bring it out![VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_ev068000_talk_02	Now that Avalugg’s quelled, too, we can survey\nall over Hisui![VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev068000_talk_02_m	Having the nobles all quelled puts a grave threat\nto rest.\c\nNow it’s time we focused on our survey work...\nthough we still can’t let our guard down around\r\nregular wild Pokémon, of course![VAR 0114(0007)]
msg_ev068000_talk_03	I certainly had my reservations as to whether\nAvalugg needed quelling...\c\nBut if it means bringing calm to everyone, then\nI suppose we did the right thing.[VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_ev068000_talk_04	[VAR BD06(0000)]I hate to think what kind of havoc the frenzied\nnobles could’ve wreaked if [VAR 0100(0000)]\r\nnever\r\ncame\r\nto us![VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev068000_talk_05	Still, even with all the nobles quelled, the rift\ndoesn’t seem to be closing, huh?[VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev068000_talk_06	[VAR BD06(0000)]Although, wait—if the rift were to disappear,\nwould that mean [VAR 0100(0000)]’d\r\nbe\r\nstuck\r\nhere?[VAR 0114(0006)]

msg_ev070400_talk_01	We can take it from here, ma’am...[VAR 0114(0030)]
msg_ev070400_talk_02	Understood.[VAR 0114(0008)]
msg_ev070400_talk_03	However, the decision was mine to accept this\nstranger as a member of the Survey Corps.[VAR 0114(0008)]
msg_ev070400_talk_04	It is only right that I should personally escort h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer\nfrom the village and to the Fieldlands Camp.[VAR 0114(0008)]

msg_ev070400_talk_07	I’ll allow it.[VAR 0114(0008)]
msg_ev070400_talk_08	Then...I’ll mark you all down as bound for the\nFieldlands Camp. Safe travels...[VAR 0114(0030)]

msg_ev070410_talk_01	I can’t believe the boss would do this...\c\nYou quelled all those nobles’ frenzies under his\nown orders![VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev070410_talk_01_m	I can’t believe the boss would do this...\c\nYou were acting on his own orders when you\nquelled the frenzied nobles...[VAR 0114(0007)]
msg_ev070410_talk_02	Quite right! Moreover, even if you did happen\nto fall from the sky, that hardly gives you the\r\npower to turn it red![VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_ev070410_talk_03	This is utterly intolerable—and, I might add,\nabsurdly unscientific!\c\nAs a man of science, I must fight such illogical\nthinking tooth and nail![VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_ev070410_talk_04	You must not.[VAR 0114(0008)]

msg_ev070410_talk_08	Though I’m afraid they’ve both already returned\nto their respective settlements...[VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_ev070410_talk_09	I bet you could at least start by finding Lian at\nGrandtree Arena. Not sure where Mai’d be, if\r\nyou want the Diamond Clan...[VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev070410_talk_09_m	Perhaps you could try to go find Lian first? He’s\nlikely to be at Grandtree Arena.[VAR 0114(0007)]
msg_ev070410_talk_10	Don’t die alone out there. That’s an order.\c\nI will ensure you have all you need to complete\nthe survey the commander has tasked you with.[VAR 0114(0008)]
msg_ev070410_talk_11	If I might offer my advice.\c\nIn this life, you will meet with both admiration\nand abuse from others.\c\nHow others choose to view you is a choice only\nthey can make.

msg_ev071000_talk_01	You! What in the world did you do?![VAR 0114(0010)]
msg_ev071000_talk_02	Look at the size of that rift!\c\nIf lightning starts pouring from it, all the Pokémon\nin Hisui could be thrown into a frenzy!\c\nThe entire clan is in a panic now![VAR 0114(0010)]
msg_ev071000_talk_03	I should have known that the only thing that\ncould come from that rift was disaster...[VAR 0114(0010)]
msg_ev071000_list_01	I need help

msg_ev071000_talk_04	Help?![VAR 0114(0010)]
msg_ev071000_talk_05	Is that really all you came to say?[VAR 0114(0010)]
msg_ev071000_talk_06	Ah. Well. That’s not exactly something I can do.\c\nIt’s not that I wouldn’t like to help you...but it\nwould put Irida in a difficult position.[VAR 0114(0010)]
msg_ev071000_talk_07	Look... You needn’t try to put on a brave face.\c\nYou’ve been a help to the Pearl Clan, and we\nknow what kind of person you are.\c\nThough, it must be said—for every sympathetic\near you might find there, you may also find a\r\ndetractor who fears your presence...[VAR 0114(0010)]
msg_ev071000_talk_08	I truly do wish that I could repay you for quelling\nKleavor’s frenzy as you did. You must know that.\r\nBut there’s nothing I alone can do for you.[VAR 0114(0010)]
msg_ev071000_talk_09	Warden Mai might be able to help you, though.\nShe’s a caring woman, after all.[VAR 0114(0010)]
msg_ev071000_talk_10	You’ll most likely find Mai at the Worn Bridge.\nI believe it’s a very significant place for her.[VAR 0114(0010)]
msg_ev071000_talk_11	I’m certain that somewhere in the vastness of\nHisui, there is a place for you as well.[VAR 0114(0010)]

msg_ev071200_talk_01	My, my... What a frightful sky.[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_ev071200_talk_02	Such a disturbing sight would be enough to put\nanyone ill at ease.[VAR 0114(000F)]

msg_ev071200_list_01	I don’t know...
msg_ev071200_list_02	I’m trying to find out
msg_ev071200_talk_04	I suppose it was too much to expect that you\ncould already have an answer to all this.[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_ev071200_talk_05	I heard from our leader what happened. You\ncan’t return to that village of yours, can you?[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_ev071200_talk_06	But I’m afraid the Diamond Clan cannot be the\nones to save you.[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_ev071200_talk_07	The Diamond Clan could end up at war with the\nGalaxy Team if things went badly. I think you\r\nwould regret that as much as anyone.[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_ev071200_talk_08	The great Wyrdeer took a liking to you. I want to\noffer you my support. But...\c\nForgive me. I cannot help you in this.[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_ev071200_talk_09	Do not abandon hope. Time solves all things.\c\nAnd besides, you seem to have a talent for\nmaking your own way in the world. I have no\r\ndoubt you’ll continue to find a path to walk.[VAR 0114(000F)]

msg_ev071300_talk_05	Don’t worry. I’ve already heard what happened.\c\nA good merchant knows well the importance of\nstaying abreast of all the latest news.[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev071300_talk_06	It seems you’re in quite the pinch. No place for\nyou among the Diamond Clan or the Pearl Clan—\c\nto say nothing of how poorly the Galaxy Team\nhas treated you![VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev071300_talk_07	But not to worry.\c\nThere are still corners of the Hisui region where\nwe can stash you away in secret.[VAR 0114(000C)]

msg_ev072000_talk_03	No “mistress,” thank you. Just Cogita.\nAnd this is?[VAR 0114(000D)]
msg_ev072000_talk_04	[VAR BD06(0000)]Why, [VAR 0100(0000)] is the [VAR 1100(00FF,0200)]woman of\nthe hour.\c\n[VAR 1100(00FF,0201)]HShe’s the one who quelled the frenzy of all the\nPokémon nobles, believe it or not.[VAR 0114(000C)]

msg_evchap07_null_08	[~ 121]
msg_ev072100_talk_01	The space-time rift is said to be a portal to\ninnumerable other dimensions...[VAR 0114(000D)]
msg_ev072100_talk_02	In one such realm, far and farther still from ours,\ndwells almighty Sinnoh.[VAR 0114(000D)]
msg_ev072100_list_01	The Diamond Clan’s...?
msg_ev072100_list_02	The Pearl Clan’s...?
msg_ev072100_talk_03	The expanse from antiquity to eternity and the\nexpanse to all sides, above, and below...[VAR 0114(000D)]

msg_ev072100_talk_06	You see, don’t you? The two together, time and\nspace, comprise all creation—the universe.[VAR 0114(000D)]
msg_ev072100_talk_07	How can one claim that either is greater than the\nother, as those two clans do?[VAR 0114(000D)]
msg_ev072100_list_03	You really can’t
msg_ev072100_list_04	They’re inseparable
msg_ev072100_talk_08	Perhaps the truth is clearer to a wanderer such as\nyou—one who has known other ages.[VAR 0114(000D)]
msg_ev072100_talk_09	Now listen, lost one. Here is what you must do.[VAR 0114(000D)]
msg_ev072100_talk_10	Hisui holds three lakes of great importance—\nLake Verity, Lake Valor, and Lake Acuity.[VAR 0114(000D)]
msg_ev072100_talk_11	At each dwells a Pokémon said to embody one\naspect of the mind.[VAR 0114(000D)]
msg_ev072100_talk_12	Complete the trials each will set you, and bear\ntheir gifts to the Shrouded Ruins.\c\nThere you may receive the [VAR FF00(0006)]Red Chain[VAR FF00(0000)]. With it,\nperhaps you can bind the world together.[VAR 0114(000D)]
msg_ev072100_talk_13	Bind the world, you say...? You mean it won’t\nclose the rift?[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev072100_talk_14	Kindly spare me your doubts, young man.\c\nI know the old words and what they bid us do.\nHow true they are isn’t mine to know.[VAR 0114(000D)]

msg_ev072100_talk_16	But...here we are. You know your duty, and you’ll\ndo it. Won’t you?[VAR 0114(000D)]
msg_ev072100_list_05	Of course!
msg_ev072100_list_06	I can’t possibly...
msg_ev072100_talk_17	There is nobility in knowing what must be done\nand seeing to it.[VAR 0114(000D)]
msg_ev072100_talk_18	What twaddle!\c\nYou would abandon the people and the\nPokémon that have cared for you? I doubt it.[VAR 0114(000D)]
msg_ev072100_sys_19	Your Arc Phone is beeping...

msg_ev072100_list_08	I’ll need to rest, too...
msg_ev072100_list_09	[~ 151]
msg_ev072100_talk_22	Ah, that is a problem, isn’t it? What shall we do\nabout that, indeed?[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev072100_talk_23	No need to worry about that! If you don’t draw\ntoo much attention, I imagine you could steal a\r\nbit of shut-eye at one of the base camps...[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev072100_talk_24	Abaaa.
msg_ev072100_talk_25	What was that cry? Have we now a lost Pokémon\nas well as a lost child? Do see to it, please.[VAR 0114(000D)]
msg_ev072100_talk_26	How could I refuse you, ma’am?[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev072100_talk_27	Off we go, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(000C)]

msg_ev072200_list_01	That’s right
msg_ev072200_list_02	It’s a secret!
msg_ev072200_talk_06	Now then... So we’re to visit three lakes?\c\nIt doesn’t sound like an easy task—that’s for sure.\nIt sure would be wonderful to have a kind soul\r\nwho might help us out...[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev072200_talk_07	Quite the opportunist, aren’t you, Volo?\nSuch a consummate guild merchant.[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev072200_talk_08	I’ve managed to reassure my people for now.\c\nThe wardens are keeping a close eye on their\nnobles, too. Seems all’s quiet for the moment.\r\nAnd so...here we are![VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev072200_talk_09	But still...we’ll never get away with openly\naiding you.[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev072200_talk_10	If we were to undermine the commander’s direct\norders, relations would grow...strained.[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev072200_talk_11	Long story short: we want to help but without\ndrawing attention, so it’ll be just one of us.\c\nMe or her—it’s up to you. Though the answer\nshould be obvious![VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_evchap07_null_28	[~ 172]

msg_ev072400_list_d_01	Yeah, I choose you
msg_ev072400_list_d_02	Let me think it over
msg_ev072400_talk_p_01	Of course you’ll choose me!\c\nI was the one who got you what you needed\nwhen you first set out to quell Kleavor. You and I\r\nmade his balms together![VAR 0114(000B)]

msg_ev072400_talk_d_05	Leftover? I’m not someone’s scraps!\c\nI will keep watch on the commander. I imagine I’ll\nhear something useful from him.[VAR 0114(000B)]

msg_ev072400_talk_p_10	But yes, we should get moving![VAR 0114(000B)]

msg_ev075000_talk_01	They say this lake actually used to be a volcano.\c\nThen it erupted, leaving a huge crater that filled\nwith water. And so Lake Verity was born.[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev075000_talk_02	It is protected by a Pokémon called Mesprit.\c\nIt was when Mesprit took flight that people first\nlearned the joys and sorrows of living.\r\nOr that’s how the old tales go, anyway.[VAR 0114(000C)]

msg_ev075000_talk_05	And another cave appears...\c\nYou know, I was too busy being amazed to\nmention this before, but the professor was right!\r\nThat Arc Phone of yours is incredible![VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev075000_talk_d_05	Let’s do this, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev075000_talk_p_05	What surprises wait within, I wonder...[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev075000_talk_06	Mistress Cogita seemed quite intent that you\nwould have to prove yourself to all three of\r\nthe Pokémon that guard these lakes...\c\nThis challenge was never for the faint of heart.[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_evchap07_null_11	[~ 209]
msg_ev075200_talk_d_01	There’s something about this place I can’t quite\nput into words...[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev075200_talk_p_01	The air feels somehow tense in here...[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev075200_sys_02	A menacing Pokémon stands before you!

msg_ev075410_talk_d_01	That’s the way, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nI can tell by watching that you and the Pokémon\nyou’ve caught in those little balls truly understand\r\none another.\c\nNow, let’s see about the Pokémon of the lake...[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev075410_talk_p_01	It’s curious, but when I watch you and your\nPokémon battle...\c\nI feel as if there’s no obstacle that can’t be\novercome if people and Pokémon work together.\c\nNow, let’s see about the Pokémon of the lake...[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev075410_sys_02	You feel a mysterious presence...

msg_ev075600_talk_d_02	So it speaks from its mind straight to yours...\nMakes sense for a Pokémon that embodies an\r\naspect of the mind, I guess.[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev075600_talk_p_02	I can only imagine how it must feel to speak\ndirectly with a Pokémon like that.[VAR 0114(000B)]

msg_ev075610_talk_01	Kyauun!
msg_ev075610_talk_d_02	I can’t even imagine what that must feel like,\nhaving a Pokémon talk to you without words...[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev075610_talk_d_03	Well, the world’s full of mysteries, I guess.\c\nI can hardly even be surprised at things like these\nafter seeing the sky itself so warped.[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev075610_talk_d_04	Now, we’ve two lakes left to visit.[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev075610_talk_d_05	Still one lake left... This is taking more time than\nI’d expected.[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev075610_talk_d_06	That was the third trial, which means... That’s it,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]! You’ve done it![VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev075610_talk_p_02	I know that Pokémon spoke with you, yet the\nwords did not reach my ears...[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev075610_talk_p_03	It’s mysterious, but...I suppose when dealing with\nsomeone who fell from the sky, it’s only natural\r\nto encounter mystery.[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev075610_talk_p_04	Next, on to Lake Valor and Lake Acuity.[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev075610_talk_p_05	One more lake to go. This trek around Hisui has\nreally brought home how vast it is.[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev075610_talk_p_06	That’s all three lakes behind us. I wonder what\nour next stop will bring...[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_evchap07_null_13	[~ 257]
msg_ev075800_talk_01	[VAR BD06(0000)]Looks like that worked out well,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev075800_talk_d_02	Gotta admit—you sure know plenty about\nHisui, Volo.[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev075800_talk_p_02	I must say...you know an awful lot about Hisui,\nVolo. I suppose a merchant like you sees all sorts\r\nof things in their travels.[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev075800_talk_03	That’s right!\c\nYou could say it’s because I’m a merchant, but\nmostly I’m just naturally filled with curiosity![VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev075800_talk_04	I want to know exactly what happened in the past\nthat led us to this particular present...[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev075800_talk_05	Or more accurately, I suppose...\c\nI want to know where I came from and where\nI’m headed. I want to know my path, so to speak.[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev075800_talk_d_06	I think we’d all like some answers on that.\c\nI don’t properly know how we came to worship\nalmighty Sinnoh in the first place. I’ve even\r\ngot some questions about its...true nature.[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev075800_talk_p_06	The same goes for me.\c\nOur clan settled at the very spot where our\nforebears once beheld almighty Sinnoh.\c\nBut I...I have still never seen almighty Sinnoh\nfor myself...[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev075800_talk_07	Weighty matters to ponder, for sure. But we have\nan important task before us!\c\nDo you want to return to Mistress Cogita’s home?[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev075800_list_01	Let’s go back
msg_ev075800_list_02	I’ll stay here
msg_ev075800_talk_09	Perfect! I’d like to see what she thinks of\nour progress.[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev075800_talk_10	Then we’ll go ahead and see you there when you\njoin us.[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev075800_talk_11	It seems we’ve finished the three lake trials!\c\nIf I remember correctly, we were told to then\nhead for the Shrouded Ruins...[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev075800_talk_12	I don’t know what could await us there, but I’m\nalways excited to explore some ancient ruins!\r\nLet us be on our way![VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_evchap07_null_14	[~ 273]
msg_ev075900_talk_01	Ahh, [VAR 0109(0001)]...\c\nSo the legends told it true. Then the Red Chain\nmust be real as well.[VAR 0114(000D)]
msg_ev075900_talk_02	I guess... But this all makes no sense to me.\c\nThese Pokémon represent our minds, and they’ll\ngive us this thing...and it’ll let us bind the world\r\nand solve all this mess? But...how? Why?[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev075900_talk_03	I beg your pardon, Cogita, ma’am...\c\nBut what do these Pokémon that represent the\nmind have to do with this Red Chain? And why\r\nexactly should it bind the world?[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev075900_talk_10	Your doubt suggests a keen intellect. I see you’re\nnot your clan’s leader for nothing.[VAR 0114(000D)]
msg_ev075900_talk_11	Without the mind, were the rift to widen and the\nvery world to end, would we even know it?[VAR 0114(000D)]
msg_ev075900_talk_12	One might even say the world—time, space, all\ncreation—exists only because our minds are there\r\nto perceive it.\c\nPerhaps the Red Chain’s purpose is to let one see\ncreation as it truly is.[VAR 0114(000D)]
msg_ev075900_talk_13	I get it even less now![VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev075900_talk_14	I... What? So does the mind create the world?\nBut isn’t it the other way around? Or is it...?[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev075900_talk_15	Such are myths, my child... Teaching us about the\nworld in their own incomprehensible ways.\c\nThey urge us to think more for ourselves—on the\nnature of almighty Sinnoh and on the nature of\r\nthe world in which we dwell.[VAR 0114(000D)]
msg_ev075900_talk_04	You’re absolutely right! Myths and legends are\nsuch fascinating things to study!\c\nIn any case, all we have to do is complete two\nmore trials and we will get the Red Chain![VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev075900_talk_05	How nonchalant you sound. How confident of\nsuccesses to which you contribute nothing.\c\nYou tag along only for the chance to gawk at\nmore ancient ruins.[VAR 0114(000D)]
msg_ev075900_talk_06	With this sky...I don’t know how long we have.\c\nI don’t mean to rush you, but we probably don’t\nhave the time to be dawdling.[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev075900_talk_07	It seems meaningful somehow where the three\nlakes are placed in vast Hisui, don’t you think?[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev075900_talk_08	Falter not, lost one.[VAR 0114(000D)]
msg_ev075900_talk_09	I wonder what the next Pokémon will be like![VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_evchap07_null_23	[~ 289]
msg_ev076000_talk_01	Do you know about Lake Valor?\c\nIt’s said to have been formed by a volcanic\neruption, much like Lake Verity.\c\nThough there are also other theories that say it\nwas carved out in the midst of a Pokémon battle.[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev076000_talk_02	This lake is protected by the Pokémon Azelf.\c\nWhen Azelf took flight, the will to do what needs\ndoing was born in people’s hearts...or that is what\r\nlegend would have us believe.[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev076000_sys_03	Your Arc Phone is beeping...
msg_ev076000_talk_04	Ho! A cave appears where there was none—\nas if just for [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev076000_talk_d_05	In we go, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev076000_talk_p_05	Let’s head in, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev076000_talk_06	I imagine strong Pokémon could wait inside,\nprotecting the Pokémon of the lake. Take care![VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_evchap07_null_15	[~ 297]
msg_ev076200_talk_d_01	Let’s see what we’re up against.[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev076200_talk_p_01	What an eerie space... Why would there be\ncolumns inside a cave, anyway?[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev076200_sys_02	A menacing Pokémon waits before you!
msg_ev076200_talk_d_03	Watch it, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nI’ve heard about this one from my grandfather.\nThose quills—they’re venomous![VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev076200_talk_p_03	[VAR BD06(0000)]Watch yourself, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nThose\r\nquills\r\nlook vicious![VAR 0114(000B)]

msg_ev076620_talk_p_02	Are you going to retire, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev076620_talk_d_03	All right. Just remember—preparation’s vital, but\nso is persistence.[VAR 0114(000A)]

msg_ev076660_talk_d_04	Looks like our lake journey’s complete![VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev076660_talk_p_02	That looked exhausting... But we still have two\nmore trials to go.[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev076660_talk_p_03	That looked exhausting... But only one more to\ngo now.[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev076660_talk_p_04	That looked exhausting... But now we’ve\njourneyed to all three lakes![VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_evchap07_null_17	[~ 332]
msg_ev076800_talk_01	I assume all went well, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev076800_talk_02	Still, I must wonder... Why don’t they just give us\nthe Red Chain? Why all this running about?[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev076800_talk_d_03	I guess I can think of two reasons: to keep the\nchain safe—and to test us.[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev076800_talk_p_03	Perhaps they mean to test whether whoever seeks\nit is worthy?[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev076800_talk_04	Perhaps you are right... Who knows what would\nhappen if it fell into the wrong hands, after all.[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev076800_talk_d_05	Though having said that—isn’t the Red Chain for\nmending the world? What use would some villain\r\nhave for it?[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev076800_talk_p_05	Though on the other hand... What use would\nthose wrong hands have for it?[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev076800_talk_06	Who can say for sure? Maybe the Red Chain\nhas some other use besides mending the world.[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev076800_talk_d_07	You could well be right.\c\nI guess we’ll have no way of knowing until we\nget the Red Chain for ourselves.[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev076800_talk_p_07	The Red Chain’s as mysterious as this entire\npredicament we’re in...\c\nBut if we continue visiting the lakes, we’ll get\ncloser to an answer![VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev076800_talk_08	So...shall we return to Mistress Cogita’s home?[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev076800_list_01	Let’s go back

msg_ev076800_talk_09	Wonderful! Then we can see if Mistress Cogita\nhas any more insights to share with us.[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev076800_talk_10	Then we’ll go ahead and see you there when you\njoin us.[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_evchap07_null_18	[~ 348]
msg_ev076900_talk_01	[VAR BD06(0000)]So that’s [VAR 0109(0001)]... I sense a\nwarmth\r\nto it.[VAR 0114(000D)]
msg_ev076900_talk_02	The Pokémon of the lakes are...strange.\nThey seem to play on your mind somehow.[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev076900_talk_03	I do have to wonder if anyone else has ever\ncompleted the trials of these lake Pokémon...[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev076900_talk_04	Indeed. Yet we may want to add just a dash more\nspeed. Things in Jubilife Village are...tense.[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev076900_talk_05	What makes you say so?[VAR 0114(000D)]

msg_ev090000_talk_03	I must apologize, from the bottom of my heart...[VAR 0114(0009)]
msg_ev090000_talk_04	To the both of you, as fellow leaders...[VAR 0114(0009)]
msg_ev090000_talk_05	You saw the truth that I could not. You never\nabandoned your trust in [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0009)]
msg_ev090000_talk_06	And to you, [VAR 0100(0000)]...[VAR 0114(0009)]
msg_ev090000_talk_07	I acted on ill-considered presumptions and\ndrove you from the Galaxy Expedition Team,\r\nforcing you to face great hardship alone...[VAR 0114(0009)]
msg_ev090000_talk_08	And despite all that, you still strove to save all\nof Hisui![VAR 0114(0009)]
msg_ev090000_talk_09	Well, it’s not like we could just sit back and\nignore the space-time rift.[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev090000_talk_10	And we understood, Commander, that you had\nreasons to act as you did.[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev090000_talk_11	Commander, might I suggest we return to the\nmatter at hand? We’ve left things in quite a state\r\nup at the temple.[VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_ev090000_talk_12	That’s the stuff, Mr. Professor! You’d rather face\nwhat’s in front of us than dwell on the past, huh?\r\nJust what I’d expect from a real scientist![VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev090000_talk_13	A dependable attitude indeed.\c\nYes, let us move on. No need to speak any\nfurther about my rash actions. Not to mention\r\nmy loss of composure...[VAR 0114(0009)]
msg_ev090000_talk_14	[VAR BD06(0000)]It seems that having [VAR 0100(0000)]\nabout\r\nhas\r\nbeen\r\na good\r\ninfluence\r\non all.[VAR 0114(0009)]
msg_ev090000_talk_15	Yeah—thank goodness you were here, huh?\nWe’d have had no chance getting through this\r\ndisaster without you![VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev090000_talk_p_15	[VAR BD06(0000)]That’s only natural. [VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)] is\nstrong\r\nenough\r\nto\r\ndefeat\r\neven\r\nthis\r\nnew\r\nopponent\r\nsingle-handedly![VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev090000_talk_d_16	We’re still not through it! How is [VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]she to keep\nfighting? The Red Chain has shattered![VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev090000_talk_p_16	Whoa, whoa! Slow down! Did you forget that the\nRed Chain broke?[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev090000_talk_d_17	Relax. I’ve got a plan...thanks to what mighty\nDialga told me![VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev090000_talk_p_17	We’ll be all right—armed with the knowledge\nmighty Palkia imparted to me![VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev090000_talk_d_18	“Dialga”? The Pokémon that spoke to you?[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev090000_talk_p_18	“Palkia”? The Pokémon that talked to you?[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev090000_talk_d_19	Yeah—and along with its name, it also told me\nwhat we need.[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev090000_talk_p_19	Yes! It told me its name—but that’s not all.\nIt also told me this...[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev090000_talk_d_20	“The stone of creation’s beginning.\c\n“The chain of red.\c\n“The vessel of humankind’s invention.\c\n“Unite these three, and calm the chaos now\npervading space.”[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev090000_talk_p_20	“The stone of creation’s beginning.\c\n“The chain of red.\c\n“The vessel of humankind’s invention.\c\n“Unite these three, and calm the chaos now\ndisturbing the flow of time.”[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev090000_talk_d_21	And finally, mighty Dialga said it wants to go with\nus back to the temple.[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev090000_talk_p_21	And then, mighty Palkia must go with us back to\nthe temple, it said.[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev090000_talk_d_22	Well, the Red Chain we have, at least!\nThe pieces, anyway. I did collect them.[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev090000_talk_p_22	Well, that “chain of red” is in pieces now, but\nif little bits will do, I gathered those.[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev090000_talk_d_23	And “the vessel of humankind’s invention”...\nI daresay that might refer to a Poké Ball.[VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_ev090000_talk_d_27	That’s got to be it! But what about that “stone of\ncreation’s beginning” part?[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev090000_talk_d_28	Lian might have some idea.\c\nHe’s knowledgeable about stones and minerals.\nHe even goes digging for ore sometimes.[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev090000_talk_32	Is that so? Then Warden Lian will be a fine\nresource to consult.\c\nAnd what are your thoughts, Professor Laventon?\nDo you have any idea what this stone could be?[VAR 0114(0009)]
msg_ev090000_talk_33	[VAR BD06(0000)]Oh! Upon my word, perhaps I do!\c\n[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)], my [VAR 1100(00FF,0403)]boygirl! Could you\nlend me\r\nthose\r\nplates\r\nyou\r\nreceived\r\nfrom\r\nWyrdeer\r\nand\r\nthe others?\c\nThe ones that Volo said had messages engraved\nupon them?[VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_ev090000_talk_34	Aha! Just as I remembered. Here on the back of\nthe Earth Plate, it says...\c\n“When the universe was created, its shards\nbecame this Plate.” I think this may be a hint to\r\nwhat we need![VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_ev090000_talk_35	How do you mean?[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev090000_talk_36	Don’t you see? We must search for stone—or\nrather ore, I suppose—that shares the same\r\nmaterial properties as these plates!\c\nIn fact, I believe that young Lian might know just\nwhere to find such a thing, as he said he’d been\r\ninvestigating it at Volo’s urging.[VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_ev090000_talk_37	Now that you mention it, that Volo fellow’s come\naround the Diamond settlement asking about\r\nthose plates before, too.[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev090000_talk_38	This seems like a lead worth following![VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev090000_talk_d_29	It’s decided, then! Thus begins our search for the\n“stone of creation’s beginning.”\c\nAlthough the name is rather a mouthful, wouldn’t\nyou say? I propose we call it...“Origin Ore”![VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_ev090000_talk_d_30	Irida. May we ask for your clan’s aid once more?[VAR 0114(0009)]
msg_ev090000_talk_d_31	Of course! I’ll call Lian to the Summit Camp\nat once.[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_evchap09_null_01	[~ 44]
msg_ev091000_talk_01	I waited as long as anyone could reasonably\nexpect, but my invitation just never came.\c\nSo I decided to honor you all with an unsolicited\nvisit. Be glad and rejoice![VAR 0114(0016)]
msg_ev091000_talk_02	Now, Adaman. I see all these other louts have\ntheir little tasks to be getting on with...\c\nBut what of the great Melli? Where’s my role in\nall this?[VAR 0114(0016)]
msg_ev091000_talk_03	I’m your leader, Melli. Show a shred of respect,\nwould you?[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev091000_talk_04	Fine! Whatever! Just hurry up and give me a job,\ngreat Leader Adaman! And make it a good one![VAR 0114(0016)]
msg_ev091000_talk_05	You want a job? Fine. Your job is to support\nthe others!\c\nAll the other wardens are busy looking after their\nnobles and keeping the people of our clans from\r\npanicking. Take a hint![VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev091000_talk_06	Oh, Adaman. Oh, oh, oh, you silly, foolish boy.\nDon’t you understand anything? Everyone has\r\nwork they are suited to and work they are not.[VAR 0114(0016)]
msg_ev091000_talk_07	And, oh! Before I forget. It seems you weren’t\nentirely useless after all, Galaxy Team grunt.\r\nWell done, you.[VAR 0114(0016)]
msg_ev091000_talk_08	Take this as a reward for your adorable efforts.\nJust my way of encouraging the little people.\r\nAnd you’re all so little compared to me.[VAR 0114(0016)]
msg_ev091000_talk_09	I’ve brought Lian.[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev091000_talk_10	Yeesh... That ugly hat suits you as poorly as this\nimportant role does. I don’t like this at all.\r\nI should be the one consulted for my wisdom![VAR 0114(0016)]
msg_ev091000_talk_11	Hisui’s ores and stones are her precious resource!\nSince I was the first to realize that fact, it’s only\r\nnatural that I should be the first consulted![VAR 0114(0010)]
msg_ev091000_talk_12	If you have a problem with it, perhaps you’d like\nto take it up with Kleavor in battle? With that\r\nbumbling ball of yours?[VAR 0114(0010)]
msg_ev091000_talk_13	Ex-CUSE me?! That “bumbling ball” is more than\ncapable of zapping both you and that ugly bug\r\nof yours all the way back to your stupidly\r\noversized tree! Shall we prove it to you now?[VAR 0114(0016)]
msg_ev091000_talk_14	Melli, give it a rest and play nice with the Pearl\nClan folks for once, would you? Bigger things are\r\nat stake here![VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev091000_talk_15	But, Adamaaan!\c\nEveryone back home is all worked up about the\nfact you were spoken to by almighty Sinnoh—\r\nor mighty Dialga or whatever.\c\nThis is the Diamond Clan’s day! Be proud![VAR 0114(0016)]
msg_ev091000_talk_21	But, Adamaaan!\c\nEveryone back home is all worked up because\nthe Pearl Clan got to speak to almighty Sinnoh—\r\nor Palkia or whatever.\c\nDo you want them to hog all the glory?![VAR 0114(0016)]
msg_ev091000_talk_16	Warden Lian. If you would?[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev091000_talk_17	Certainly![VAR 0114(0010)]
msg_ev091000_talk_18	Then let us set out at once... We make for the\nPrimeval Grotto![VAR 0114(0010)]
msg_evchap09_null_15	[~ 64]
msg_ev091200_talk_01	What a curious cave...\c\nI feel some extraordinary power here—as if the\nworld itself was created in this very place.[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev091200_talk_02	What do you think, Lian?[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev091200_talk_03	Taking into consideration my knowledge of\nores, my skill at mining, and the strength of\r\nmy Sliggoo’s moves...[VAR 0114(0010)]
msg_ev091200_talk_04	I think you’d better leave any extraction work up\nto us, wouldn’t you say?[VAR 0114(0010)]
msg_ev091200_talk_05	We’re going to have to ask you to stop\nright there.[VAR 0114(0004)]
msg_ev091200_talk_06	Oh, come on... Who’s there? We don’t have any\ntime to waste with—[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev091200_talk_07	Clover?! We haven’t seen you since you walked\nout on the clan! Where’ve you been all this time?![VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev091200_talk_14	Hmph. I don’t have to tell you nothin’.[VAR 0114(0023)]
msg_ev091200_talk_15	Look, you can carry on digging out that treasure\nyou’re after. And then you’ll give it to us.[VAR 0114(0022)]
msg_ev091200_talk_16	I don’t know why you even look surprised. It’s not\nas if you were hard to follow.[VAR 0114(0024)]
msg_ev091200_talk_17	What we seek may be as precious as treasure,\nbut this isn’t about how valuable it is—we need it\r\nto restore this awful sky to normal![VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev091200_talk_18	Ugh. That earnest goody-two-shoes act of yours\nis what made me leave the Pearl Clan in the\r\nfirst place![VAR 0114(0024)]
msg_ev091200_talk_19	Enough. I don’t care why any of you ran off to\nplay bandit. But I won’t let you get in Lian’s way.\c\nThere are three of you and three of us. Let’s go.\n[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]? You take Charm.[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev091200_talk_20	I bring good luck to my sisters wherever I go—\nand ill luck to anyone who crosses our paths.\c\nI’m the eldest, and I’ll be your unlucky Charm.\nEspecially in this: the battle of a lifetime![VAR 0114(0022)]
msg_evchap09_null_23	[~ 79]
msg_ev091210_talk_01	Come on, Clover... Why not come back to the\nDiamond Clan?\c\nTimes are changing. We’re changing. And we\ncould really use someone as strong as you are.[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev091210_talk_02	Are you joking? I’ve got no interest in living\nback in that place, with all its stupid rules![VAR 0114(0023)]
msg_ev091210_talk_03	Look. We’ll let you keep your treasure this time.\nBut you’d better do something about that sky.[VAR 0114(0024)]
msg_ev091210_talk_04	[VAR BD06(0000)]You are as strong as ever,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]...\r\nMaybe\r\nyou\r\nreally\r\ncan\r\ndo\r\nsomething\r\nabout\r\nthat\r\nmonstrous\r\ncreature\r\nat the\r\ntop of\r\nthe mountain.\c\nBut even if you do, the next time we meet, you\nwon’t escape without a beating! Remember that![VAR 0114(0022)]
msg_ev091210_talk_05	Honestly, those three... What did they even come\nhere for?\c\nOh well. I’ll heal up everyone’s Pokémon.[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev091210_talk_06	The Coin that I remember never hesitated to\nhelp someone in need, even if she groused as\r\nshe did so.\c\nI suspect they may have been...worried about us.\nPerhaps even wanting to help...[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev091210_talk_07	Then they should’ve just said so! What a pain\nthey are, hiding behind all that attitude...[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev091210_talk_08	I was able to extract some of that “Origin Ore,”\nor whatever it is you wish to call it. I suppose it\r\nhad better go with you, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0010)]
msg_ev091210_talk_09	That was surprisingly easy.[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev091210_talk_10	No, you simply fail to recognize my skill.\nYou ought to be praising my hard work! Honestly.[VAR 0114(0010)]
msg_ev091210_talk_11	I knew we could count on you, Lian! No wonder\nKleavor recognizes you as a worthy warden![VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev091210_talk_12	Let’s hurry back to Mr. Professor and show him\nwhat we got.\c\nThat Laventon’s got sound judgment, plus\nknowledge to spare, despite his silly streak![VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_evchap09_null_16	[~ 92]
msg_ev091400_talk_01	So this is the “stone of creation’s beginning”...\nThe Origin Ore...[VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_ev091400_talk_02	Mhm, yes, one can certainly feel an imposing aura\nemanating from it... Could this be...the feeling of\r\nthe very origin itself?[VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_ev091400_talk_03	I’ve been meaning to ask since you brought that\nup, but...the origin of what exactly?[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev091400_talk_04	Of everything, by the sound of it.[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev091400_talk_05	Exactly, my girl.\c\nNow then, back we go to Jubilife Village![VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_evchap09_null_17	[~ 98]
msg_ev091410_talk_d_01	Here you are, Professor Laventon—what remains\nof the Red Chain, broken as it may be.[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev091410_talk_p_01	All right, Mr. Professor. It’s all in pieces now,\nbut this is what’s left of the Red Chain.[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev091410_talk_02	Splendid! Even in pieces, I think we’ll find it’s\nstill perfectly fit for purpose.\c\nWe’re jolly lucky you had the foresight to pick up\nall these broken bits back at the temple![VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_ev091410_talk_03	[VAR BD06(0000)]You’re up next, [VAR 0100(0000)]. Time\nfor...uh,\r\nwhatever\r\nwe’re\r\ncalling\r\nthat stone![VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev091410_talk_03_m	[VAR BD06(0000)]Your turn, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nNext\r\ncomes\r\nthe\r\nstone of\r\ncreation’s beginning.[VAR 0114(0007)]
msg_ev091410_sys_04	You handed over the Origin Ore.
msg_ev091410_talk_05	The fragments of the Red Chain, collected at\ngreat personal risk by the Pearl Clan...\c\nThen the stone of creation’s beginning, which we\nfirst learned of thanks to the Diamond Clan...\c\nAnd now it is time for the Galaxy Team to play\nits part and turn these items into a proper vessel.[VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_ev091410_talk_09	The fragments of the Red Chain, collected at\ngreat personal risk by the Diamond Clan...\c\nThen the stone of creation’s beginning, which we\nonly learned of thanks to the Pearl Clan...\c\nAnd now it is time for the Galaxy Team to play\nits part and turn these items into a proper vessel.[VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_ev091410_talk_06	Rei, my boy. You are one of our team’s greatest\ncraftspeople. Could I ask you to do the honors?[VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_ev091410_talk_06_m	Akari, my girl. You are one of our team’s greatest\ncraftspeople. Could I ask you to do the honors?[VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_ev091410_talk_07	[VAR BD06(0000)]Heh. Just wait, [VAR 0100(0000)]! You’ll\nfinally\r\nsee\r\nwhat\r\nI’m\r\ntruly\r\ncapable of![VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev091410_talk_07_m	[VAR BD06(0000)]This is my true battlefield,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].\r\nEven\r\nif it\r\nmay\r\nbe\r\nsafe indoors.[VAR 0114(0007)]

msg_evchap09_null_18	[~ 112]
msg_ev091420_talk_01	Come on, Mr. Professor... Wish they’d hurry it up\nin there...[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev091420_talk_02	I’m starting to suspect all your prattling about the\nvalue of time is a cover for your own impatience.[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev091420_talk_03	If sitting back and waiting actually solved things,\nI’d sit forever—because that’d be using time well,\r\nunlike this.[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev091420_talk_04	[VAR BD06(0000)]We’ve done it, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nIt’s complete![VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_ev091420_talk_05	I dub it...the Origin Ball!\c\nIf the message conveyed to our good clan leader\ncan be believed, then this should allow you to\r\ncatch the Pokémon that has appeared at the\r\nTemple of Sinnoh![VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_ev091420_talk_06	These Poké Balls of yours are full of wonders.\c\nTo think the fate of all Hisui could rest in\nsomething so tiny...[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev091420_talk_07	It’s interesting how catching a Pokémon in\none of these things brings the two of you\r\ncloser together.[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev091420_talk_d_08	Whoa! Hold on—it’s that voice. I hear it in my\nhead again...[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev091420_talk_d_09	You mean Dialga?[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev091420_talk_d_10	Yeah...\c\nSeems like mighty Dialga’s willing to lend its\nstrength to this fight. That’s what it’s telling me.[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev091420_talk_11	That’s certainly excellent news!\c\nThe Diamond Clan’s almighty Sinnoh—or perhaps\nI should say Dialga—is fearsomely powerful.[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev091420_talk_d_11	W-wait, please! I hear something... That voice is\nspeaking in my mind again.[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev091420_talk_d_13	You mean Palkia?[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev091420_talk_d_14	Yes... It appears that mighty Palkia is willing to\nlend its own strength to us in this battle.[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev091420_talk_12	Now that’s what I like to hear!\c\nThe Pearl Clan’s almighty Sinnoh—well, I guess\nI should just call it Palkia—is one fierce Pokémon![VAR 0114(000A)]

msg_ev093000_talk_d_05	The being you will encounter at the Temple of\nSinnoh is Palkia, ruler of all space.\c\nIf it is allowed to run wild, space itself will warp\nand bend here in Hisui, and eventually, the very\r\nworld may be broken.[VAR 0114(000D)]

msg_ev093000_talk_d_06	But you have the aid of its counterpart—Dialga,\nthe ruler of time. And therein lies hope.\c\nBalance will be brought to time and space,\nand the world can once again be as it should.[VAR 0114(000D)]
msg_ev093000_talk_d_07	Now, take Dialga at your side and make for the\nTemple of Sinnoh once more![VAR 0114(000D)]

msg_ev093000_talk_08	I must say, this is quite the intriguing village...\nPerhaps I’ll have a look around before I go—\r\nsee what your clothier has on offer.[VAR 0114(000D)]
msg_ev093000_talk_09	Excuse me? Is this the time for shopping?![VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev093000_talk_10	Well, I’ll hardly have time for shopping if the\nworld ends, will I, young man?[VAR 0114(000D)]
msg_ev093000_talk_11	Fair point.[VAR 0114(000A)]

msg_ev093200_talk_03	I want to have front-row seats if there’s a chance\nto see into the world of myth and legend!\c\nI’ll probably be creeping even closer to the\naction once the battle actually begins.[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev093200_talk_04	Oh, but you won’t have to worry about me!\nI’m perfectly capable of taking care of myself.[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev093200_talk_05	And besides, I know all too well the strength of\nyou and your Pokémon. I’ve got no doubt you’ll\r\nhave this whole thing tied up in a neat bow\r\nbefore I could possibly be in any danger![VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_evchap09_null_07	[~ 154]
msg_ev093400_talk_01	For so long, I’d thought that I had to eliminate\nany outside element that might threaten the\r\npeople of Jubilife Village.\c\nWhether that meant banishing you or seeking\nto destroy the Pokémon of the temple, I felt it\r\nwas my only path.\c\nBut you’ve shown me that I was wrong to think\nin such a way.[VAR 0114(0009)]

You\ncaught the perfect one at the Temple of Sinnoh,\r\ndid you not?[VAR 0114(0009)]
msg_ev093400_talk_03	You have Dialga with you!\c\nThat such a powerful Pokémon has chosen to ally\nitself with you must mean something.[VAR 0114(0009)]

msg_ev093400_talk_05	What is that supposed to mean?[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev093400_talk_06	It’s a saying we’ve got in the Diamond Clan.\nIt means you hope you’ll both stay safe.[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev093400_talk_07	Hmm. Perhaps it’s worth listening to what the\nDiamond Clan has to say sometimes as well.[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev093400_talk_11	[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]. In all of vast\nspace,\r\nyour\r\nplace\r\nhas\r\nfound you.[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev093400_talk_12	What in the world does that mean?[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev093400_talk_13	It’s a Pearl Clan saying.\c\nIt reminds us that occasions we must rise to are\nalso stages where we may prove ourselves—\r\nwhere we might shine our brightest.[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev093400_talk_14	So basically, you’re saying not to feel nervous?\c\nI’m starting to see the appeal of how you Pearl\nClan people think. In some situations, anyway.[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev093400_talk_08	[VAR BD06(0000)]We will support you in whatever way we can,\nthough I doubt you’ll need it.\c\n[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]... Protect Hisui and\nher\r\npeople!\r\nProtect\r\ntime\r\nand\r\nspace\r\nfor\r\nher Pokémon![VAR 0114(0009)]

msg_ev093420_talk_p_03	Finally...[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev093420_talk_04	Just what I’d expect of my protégé.[VAR 0114(0006)]

msg_ev093420_talk_16	The two clans together, huh...[VAR 0114(000A)]

msg_ev100000_talk_01	Morning, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev100000_talk_02	So the space-time rift is gone... Think this means\nwe can finally close the book on this whole mess?\c\nWell, in any case, there’s one book we can’t\nclose yet: the Pokédex! Time to get back to our\r\nofficial Survey Corps duty of completing it![VAR 0114(0006)]

msg_ev100000_talk_02_m	It looks like the space-time rift has vanished...\nThe sky’s gone back to normal again.\c\nWhich I suppose means we’d better get back to\nour original mission: completing the Pokédex.[VAR 0114(0007)]

msg_evchap10_null_01	[~ 8]
msg_ev100200_talk_01	So. I trust you enjoyed yourself at the festival.[VAR 0114(0008)]
msg_ev100200_list_01	Sure did!
msg_ev100200_list_02	I’m exhausted
msg_ev100200_talk_02	Indeed.[VAR 0114(0008)]
msg_ev100200_talk_03	That only seems natural, given the crowd.[VAR 0114(0008)]
msg_ev100200_talk_04	I believe last night was the first time I’ve caught\na glimpse of you making merry, Captain![VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_ev100200_talk_05	I believe you must be imagining things.\c\nNow, Professor Laventon, to business. What is\nthe current state of progress on the Pokédex?[VAR 0114(0008)]
msg_ev100200_talk_06	I daresay we’ve made quite significant progress,\nall in all.[VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_ev100200_talk_07	Though we could afford to put a little more\neffort into our research tasks...[VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_ev100200_talk_08	And of course it is hard to know how far to go\nin pursuit of some reports. Certain Pokémon\r\nhave only been mentioned in Hisui’s legends,\r\nafter all. Who knows if they are even real![VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_ev100200_talk_09	Yeah, we’re still relatively new to these parts.\nHow are we to know what’s true and what’s not?[VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev100200_talk_09_m	With how little we know about Hisui’s history and\nlegends, it seems a tall order for us to tackle...[VAR 0114(0007)]
msg_ev100200_talk_10	Pardon! Couldn’t help but overhear![VAR 0114(0004)]
msg_ev100200_talk_11	If it’s Hisuian history and legends you want, then\nI’m your man![VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev100200_talk_12	Why, I’ve spent plenty of time studying such\nthings instead of— Ahem. I mean while also\r\ntirelessly doing my work for the Ginkgo Guild.\c\nAnd I’ve visited many of the ruins and whatnot\nhere in the Hisui region already!\c\nI imagine I could teach you a thing or two about\nany Pokémon of legend in these parts![VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev100200_talk_13	Oho! Music to my ears, my good fellow.[VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_ev100200_talk_14	Listen well, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nYou are to learn all you can from the merchant\nVolo and work together as needed. For the sake\r\nof the Pokédex.[VAR 0114(0008)]
msg_ev100200_talk_15	We, meanwhile, will also continue to gather\nintelligence on Pokémon by other means.[VAR 0114(0008)]
msg_ev100200_talk_16	Understood! I’ll set up at the Heights Camp, then.\n[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)], I’ll be expecting you![VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev100200_talk_17	Besides, I’ve something I’d like to discuss with\nyou too, so I hope you won’t keep me waiting![VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev100200_talk_18	If you’d like my advice, it is only this: stay true\nto your own beliefs, no matter what others say.[VAR 0114(0008)]
msg_ev100200_talk_19	Oooh, I am giddy at the thought of discovering\nsome Pokémon that may have been around\r\nsince the days of legend and myth![VAR 0114(0005)]
msg_ev100200_talk_20	Guess I’ll put my head down and get to crafting.\nCan’t do our surveys without our tools![VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_ev100200_talk_20_m	I’m trying to help the professor categorize\ndifferent Pokémon’s habitats...\r\nbut there are just so many of them![VAR 0114(0007)]
msg_ev100200_talk_21	Hrrrm... I suppose there is no end to the study\nof Pokémon, even if the Pokédex is complete.[VAR 0114(0009)]
msg_evchap10_null_02	[~ 34]
msg_ev100400_talk_01	[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]! There you are![VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev100400_talk_02	Have a look here, if you will. A good, long, close\nlook, please![VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev100400_talk_03	See these patterns modeled after Pokémon?\nI’ve come to think that they might be letters—\r\nrather like hieroglyphs, if you will.[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev100400_talk_04	I’ve inspected ruins across the region and have\nconcluded that they all seem to tell the same tale.[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev100400_talk_05	The tale of a brave soul who, together with the\nPokémon at his side, went on a journey to search\r\nfor the fragments of an all-encompassing deity.[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev100400_list_01	A deity?
msg_ev100400_list_02	All-encompassing?
msg_ev100400_talk_06	Yes. An all-encompassing deity—the creator of\nthis very universe. And its name is...[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev100400_talk_07	Arceus.[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev100400_talk_08	Perhaps you’ve already heard this name?[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev100400_list_03	It does sound familiar
msg_ev100400_list_04	Doesn’t ring a bell
msg_ev100400_talk_09	Of course! What else could I have expected from\nthe hero who saved the Hisui region![VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev100400_talk_10	But that device you have—I was able to get a\ngood look at it as we were visiting the lakes.\r\nYou say it’s called an Arc Phone, correct?\c\nI could swear that it has some sort of tie\nto Arceus...[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev100400_talk_11	But now, let us discuss the fragments.[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev100400_talk_12	They must surely be the plates!\c\nYes, the very plates you collected as you went\nabout quelling all the frenzied nobles.[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev100400_talk_13	Haven’t you noticed that they all have words\ncarved on their backs? Go on—give them a read.[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev100400_talk_14	You read the text engraved on the back of the\nfirst plate you obtained...
msg_ev100400_talk_15	“The Original One breathed alone before the\nuniverse came.”
msg_ev100400_talk_16	This “Original One” is none other than the\nPokémon known as Arceus.[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev100400_talk_17	[VAR BD06(0000)]So, what do you say, [VAR 0100(0000)]?\nI think\r\nwe\r\nshould\r\ntry\r\nto\r\ngather\r\nall\r\nthe plates![VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev100400_talk_18	And I’ve got just the idea where to start our\nsearch. Join me in the heart of Grueling Grove![VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_evchap10_null_03	[~ 57]
msg_ev100600_talk_01	[VAR BD06(0000)]Now, [VAR 0100(0000)],\naccording\r\nto\r\nmy\r\nown investigations...[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev100600_talk_02	[VAR BD06(0000)]Wha—? An alpha Vespiquen?! Terribly sorry,\n[VAR 0100(0000)], but...do you\r\nthink\r\nyou\r\ncould\r\nhandle it?[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev100600_talk_03	[VAR BD06(0000)]Come now, [VAR 0100(0000)]! You’re\nstronger\r\nthan\r\nany\r\nother\r\nin Hisui!\c\nPlease, take care of that Vespiquen![VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_evchap10_null_38	[~ 61]
msg_ev100610_talk_01	You obtained the Stone Plate!
msg_ev100610_talk_02	Why did that alpha Pokémon have the plate we\nwere looking for? Maybe it just happened to find\r\nthe plate lying around...[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev100610_talk_03	In any case, that’s the only other plate that I had\nany information about, so...that’s that!\c\nAnd yet nothing seems to be happening. Which\nmakes me suspect there must still be more plates\r\nleft out there for us to find.[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev100610_talk_04	Not to worry though! I know the perfect person\nto ask—she’s bound to know all about the plates![VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev100610_list_01	Mistress Cogita!
msg_ev100610_list_02	“She”?
msg_ev100610_talk_05	The one and only Mistress Cogita, yes.\c\nYou haven’t had the chance to properly thank her\nfor her help in obtaining the Red Chain, am I\r\nright? All the more reason to pay her a visit.\c\nSo, onward to the Ancient Retreat![VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_evchap10_null_34	[~ 69]
msg_ev100800_talk_01	Oh, lost one... It’s miraculous what you’ve done![VAR 0114(000D)]
msg_ev100800_talk_02	It seems the Red Chain served its purpose well.[VAR 0114(000D)]
msg_ev100800_talk_03	And you carried out your duty, as you were bid.[VAR 0114(000D)]
msg_ev100800_talk_04	But what brings you here? Have you yet need\nof me?[VAR 0114(000D)]
msg_ev100800_list_01	It’s about Arceus
msg_ev100800_list_02	It’s about the plates
msg_ev100800_talk_05	Ah, yes. A tale whose origins lie a millennium or\ntwo ago...\c\nThose were the days of the ancient Sinnoh\npeople, from whom I am descended across\r\nmany generations.\c\nThese forbears of mine worshiped Arceus\nas the Pokémon that created the Hisui region.\c\nAnd I have heard of certain fragments—plates, as\nthey are called—that were given to the ancestors\r\nof Pokémon such as Kleavor and Wyrdeer.[VAR 0114(000D)]
msg_ev100800_talk_06	Is that all? I thought that surely you could tell us\nmore about Arceus and the plates...[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev100800_talk_07	I’m afraid I’ve nothing new to tell you.\c\nWhy, the Diamond and Pearl Clans would never\nhave confused Dialga and Palkia with the creator,\r\nArceus, had anything concrete been passed down.[VAR 0114(000D)]
msg_ev100800_talk_08	[VAR BD06(0000)]If only we had more to go on. The answers to\nthese mysteries may even shed light on why\r\n[VAR 0100(0000)]\r\nhere\r\nfell\r\nfrom\r\nthe sky.[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev100800_talk_09	Aha. I see what you intend. Very well—I’ll help as\nbest as I can.[VAR 0114(000D)]
msg_ev100800_talk_10	There are still other tremendous Pokémon in\nHisui—other mysteries to be solved.\c\nWhether they are connected to Arceus, I cannot\nsay for certain. But in searching them out,\r\nperhaps you’ll stumble upon the path you seek.\c\nLet me think...\c\nThere are the Pokémon of the lakes, of course.\nAnd the temple giant.\c\nThe crescent moon, the volcano... And perhaps\nyou might even return to the very beginning...[VAR 0114(000D)]
msg_ev100800_talk_11	Now, then... What would you hear of?[VAR 0114(000D)]
msg_ev100800_list_03	The three lake Pokémon

msg_ev100800_talk_13	The secret that lurks in Snowpoint Temple...\nTo find it, you must open the door that is sealed.[VAR 0114(000D)]
msg_ev100800_talk_14	Yes, the moon... You must go where you may\nmeet the moon’s gaze unobstructed. Does that\r\nclue illuminate your path?\c\nWell...make for the Coronet Highlands, for now.[VAR 0114(000D)]
msg_ev100800_talk_15	Well, where could that be but Firespit Island![VAR 0114(000D)]
msg_ev100800_talk_20	Indeed—a beginning for you, certainly... Where\nwas it you first fell to earth here?[VAR 0114(000D)]
msg_ev100800_talk_19	Done with your questions, are you?[VAR 0114(000D)]
msg_ev100800_talk_16	Very well, lost one. The rest depends on you and\nyour efforts.[VAR 0114(000D)]
msg_ev100800_talk_17	It appears that the opening of the space-time rift\ncompelled Pokémon that might otherwise have\r\nstayed hidden to come out and see what has\r\nbefallen the world.\c\nI hope you succeed—for your own sake and for\nthat of the Pokédex you labor on.[VAR 0114(000D)]
msg_ev100800_talk_18	I knew we could rely on you, Mistress Cogita!\nThat’s more than enough information to work\r\nwith. Now, let us find those plates![VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev100800_talk_21	You’d do well to go and look into those five\nleads I’ve told you of, lost one.[VAR 0114(000D)]
msg_evchap10_null_04	[~ 99]
msg_ev100810_talk_01	It’s just as I had suspected! Pokémon are the key\nto our search, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev100810_talk_02	If we can gather all the plates from them and\ndecipher the messages on the backs of the plates\r\nat last, perhaps we can meet Arceus itself![VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev100810_talk_03	You should go search for the Pokémon that\nCogita mentioned, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nI have my own avenues of research that I’d like\nto pursue.[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev100810_talk_04	Arceus, creator of all Hisui...\c\nI truly can’t wait to see what kind of Pokémon it\nmight be![VAR 0114(000C)]

msg_ev103000_talk_05	Oh dear. You seem reluctant to get involved.[VAR 0114(0014)]
msg_ev103000_talk_06	It’s just...very hot there.[VAR 0114(000B)]

msg_ev103000_talk_08	N-no, Lina, I didn’t—[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev103000_talk_09	Oh, stop with that silly old nickname in front\nof others, won’t you![VAR 0114(0014)]
msg_ev103000_talk_10	I’m sorry! I didn’t mean anything by it! It’s just\nan...an old habit...[VAR 0114(000B)]

msg_evchap10_null_42	[~ 137]
msg_ev103410_sys_01	You obtained the Iron Plate!
msg_ev103410_talk_02	Phew. At least the heat’s let up a bit.[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev103410_talk_03	With both Arcanine and Heatran spewing flames\nabout on a volcanic island, it certainly does get\r\na bit toasty...[VAR 0114(0013)]
msg_ev103410_talk_04	Warden Iscan, I have to ask... Do you think there\nwas any need at all for me to be here?[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_ev103410_talk_05	Uh, well, um... Y-yes, of course there was!\c\nAfter all, you are the leader of the Pearl Clan,\nand this trouble cropped up right around the seat\r\nof one of your clan’s nobles so...um...\r\nYes, it was surely best for you to come see to it.\r\nAdmirable of you to look after your clan’s affairs.[VAR 0114(0013)]

msg_ev104000_talk_01	I don’t suppose a grunt like you would even\nknow, but I guess it behooves me to ask...\r\nDo you know the Pokémon called Cresselia?[VAR 0114(0016)]
msg_ev104000_list_01	I do
msg_ev104000_list_02	I don’t
msg_ev104000_talk_02	Well! I figured you’d know. I wouldn’t expect\nany less from someone who managed to defeat\r\nme, even if it was just a fluke![VAR 0114(0016)]
msg_ev104000_talk_03	Well, she is an incredibly rare Pokémon. It’s no\nfault of your own that you don’t know about it.[VAR 0114(0011)]
msg_ev104000_talk_04	Cresselia is said to be the very embodiment of\nthe crescent moon.\c\nHer feathers are called Lunar Feathers, and\nlegend says that if you hold one as you fall\r\nasleep, you’ll be visited with wondrous dreams.[VAR 0114(0011)]
msg_ev104000_talk_05	Well, I call her a nightmare, that pesky Cresselia!\c\nShe’s descended upon Moonview Arena and\ncaused my lord to hide itself away!\c\nI’m so worried about Electrode that I can’t even\nsleep, never mind dream![VAR 0114(0016)]
msg_ev104000_talk_06	Think you might be able to catch Cresselia and\nperhaps even claim one of those Lunar Feathers?[VAR 0114(0011)]
msg_ev104000_talk_07	Oh, do catch that pesky flying croissant! Do it for\nmy poor Electrode...\c\nThough I suppose Cresselia can’t be all bad, if\nshe at least recognizes the perfection of the arena\r\nlooked after with loving care by the great Melli![VAR 0114(0016)]
msg_ev104000_talk_08	Lunaaan...
msg_evchap10_null_43	[~ 158]
msg_ev104010_sys_01	You obtained the Dread Plate!
msg_ev104010_talk_02	Well, well, this is unexpected. Instead of a Lunar\nFeather, you got some kind of a plate...\r\nI do feel power emanating from it, though.\c\nIn any case, if Cresselia did not gift us with any of\nher feathers, then I suppose she thought we had\r\nno need for them.[VAR 0114(0011)]
msg_ev104010_talk_03	Not bad at all, grunt. Though I suppose anyone\nwith enough luck to best the great Melli should\r\nbe able to handle at least that much.\c\nThinking about it, a halfway competent person\nlike you might actually make a decent sparring\r\npartner to help my lord and I grow stronger still![VAR 0114(0016)]
msg_ev104010_talk_04	I will go back to the settlement and tell the\nothers about the feathers...that we didn’t get.[VAR 0114(0011)]
msg_evchap10_null_17	[~ 163]
msg_ev105000_talk_01	Oh! Wouldn’t have expected to run into you up\nhere, [VAR 0100(0000)]. What are you up to?[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev105000_talk_02	You’re here to try and find the secrets lurking in\nSnowpoint Temple, aren’t you?\r\nThat’s what my clairvoyance told me.[VAR 0114(0018)]
msg_ev105000_talk_03	You do tend get mixed up in all kinds of strange\ngoings-on, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev105000_talk_04	This door here—well, they say behind it sleeps\na Pokémon so great it could tow around the\r\nentirety of the continents that lie to the south.[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev105000_talk_05	No matter what we do, this door just won’t seem\nto open...[VAR 0114(0018)]
msg_evchap10_null_49	[~ 169]
msg_ev105200_sys_01	The Stone Plate and Icicle Plate you carry seem\nto be reacting to the door...\c\nBut the door remains closed tight.
msg_ev105200_sys_02	The Stone Plate, Iron Plate, and Icicle Plate\nyou’re carrying are reacting to the door!
msg_evchap10_null_48	[~ 172]
msg_ev105400_talk_01	Wh-what in time is that thing?! It’s colossal![VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev105400_talk_02	It sure seems to be a Pokémon, but let’s see what\nmy clairvoyance has to say...[VAR 0114(0018)]
msg_ev105400_talk_03	Yup! Definitely a Pokémon!\c\nMy clairvoyance showed me a vision of it\nin motion![VAR 0114(0018)]
msg_evchap10_null_50	[~ 176]
msg_ev105600_talk_01	...Zut zutt!
msg_evchap10_null_44	[~ 178]
msg_ev105610_sys_01	You obtained the Blank Plate!
msg_ev105610_talk_02	Now that was one solid Pokémon! Like a giant\nborn of the very earth![VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev105610_talk_03	I guess this is just part of your job with the Survey\nCorps, huh?[VAR 0114(0018)]
msg_ev105610_talk_04	[VAR BD06(0000)]What kind of Pokémon is the one you just caught,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]? Hmmm?\r\nI can’t\r\nwait\r\nto see\r\nin the\r\nPokédex\r\nwhen\r\nit’s done![VAR 0114(0018)]
msg_ev105610_talk_05	Yeah, I’m pretty curious to read everything\nMr. Professor writes up, too.[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_ev105610_talk_06	[VAR BD06(0000)]See you, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nWe should\r\ndo another\r\nchase sometime![VAR 0114(0018)]
msg_evchap10_null_31	[~ 185]
msg_ev106000_talk_01	I’ve had a message from Mistress Cogita.\c\nI’m told you’re collecting plates of some sort\nwith the merchant Volo?[VAR 0114(0009)]
msg_ev106000_talk_02	Then we must go to Prelude Beach.\nMeet me there.[VAR 0114(0009)]
msg_evchap10_null_45	[~ 188]
msg_ev106200_talk_01	Prelude Beach... Indeed a place of beginning.[VAR 0114(0009)]
msg_ev106200_talk_02	Now is not the time for words.[VAR 0114(0009)]
msg_ev106200_talk_03	Face me in battle![VAR 0114(0009)]
msg_evchap10_null_46	[~ 192]
msg_ev106210_talk_01	You’ve grown even stronger since we faced one\nanother on Mount Coronet.\c\nIt’s clear you do not view Pokémon as dangerous\nenemies but rather as trustworthy allies—\r\nallies with whom you can reach great heights.[VAR 0114(0009)]
msg_ev106210_talk_02	Perhaps you are a divine being yourself, sent to\nbring us gifts from above...\c\nHere! You should have this.[VAR 0114(0009)]
msg_ev106210_sys_03	You received the Fist Plate!
msg_ev106210_talk_04	When the very first of our Galaxy Expedition\nTeam—myself, Beni, and the others—set foot\r\non Prelude Beach, we found that plate.[VAR 0114(0009)]
msg_ev106210_talk_05	It clearly held some kind of power, and so I’ve\nkept it safe all this time.\c\nI find it fitting that it should now end up with you,\nwho likewise arrived here on this same beach![VAR 0114(0009)]
msg_ev106210_talk_06	Perhaps something is guiding us...\c\nIndeed, it must be so. You and I, Adaman, Irida...\nIt’d appear we’re all being guided by the one\r\ncalled almighty Sinnoh.\c\nHrrrm. It might be more appropriate to call this\nregion the Sinnoh region.[VAR 0114(0009)]
msg_ev106210_talk_07	I know I’ve no right to say this...\c\nBut we are truly fortunate to have been able to\ncount you among the Survey Corps’ ranks.\c\nIf you had not joined us, we would have fallen on\nMount Coronet. We would have lost our home.\r\nWe would have lost our future.[VAR 0114(0009)]
msg_ev106210_talk_08	Now then. Carry on with your survey work!\c\nThe knowledge that you collect about the wild\nPokémon of this region will serve to illuminate\r\nour path forward as we walk into the future![VAR 0114(0009)]
msg_evchap10_null_37	[~ 201]
msg_ev106900_sys_01	You’ve gathered the plates related to each of the\nstories Cogita told you about.\c\nYou should head back to Cogita’s retreat!
msg_ev106900_sys_02	Based on Cogita’s hints, it seems there might\nbe [VAR 0200(0001)] more plate[VAR 1101(0001,0100)]s left for you to find.
msg_evchap10_null_35	[~ 204]
msg_ev107000_talk_01	Here you are again. Have you collected all\nthe plates?[VAR 0114(000D)]
msg_ev107000_talk_02	[VAR BD06(0000)]Of course! [VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]\nis a\r\nfamed\r\nmember\r\nof\r\nthe\r\nSurvey\r\nCorps,\r\nafter all![VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev107000_talk_03	So, what more can you tell us? We’re so close\nnow! You must know more about the plates![VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev107000_talk_04	If there’s yet more you want to know...kindly\nbring me wood. Three logs will do.[VAR 0114(000D)]
msg_ev107000_talk_05	Wood? So you’re saying wood is somehow tied\nto the plates...?\c\nWell, I suppose that’s what we get to learn next!\nHop to it, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nWhile it shames me to admit it, merchant that I\nam, I’m quite out of wood in my stores just now...[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev107000_talk_80	I suppose I should see this search of\nyours through...[VAR 0114(000D)]
msg_ev107000_talk_81	Three logs of wood... What kind of secret could\nlie behind Mistress Cogita’s request?![VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev107000_talk_82	[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]! Have you got all the wood?\nThen we must give it to Mistress Cogita! There’s\r\nno time to lose![VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_evchap10_null_47	[~ 213]
msg_ev107200_talk_18	Have you gathered the three logs I requested,\nlost one?[VAR 0114(000D)]
msg_ev107200_list_01	Here you go
msg_ev107200_list_02	Not yet
msg_ev107200_talk_19	Is that so? Then I’ll disregard the feeling that told\nme you’d gathered them.[VAR 0114(000D)]
msg_ev107200_sys_02	You handed over three logs of wood.
msg_ev107200_talk_01	Oh-ho! Yes, this certainly ought to do.[VAR 0114(000D)]
msg_ev107200_talk_02	Now the moment comes at last! The big reveal!\nWhat, pray tell, is the secret behind this wood?![VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev107200_talk_03	Secret? Your expectations need tempering, I fear.\nThis wood is merely for fashioning myself new\r\ncutting boards.[VAR 0114(000D)]
msg_ev107200_talk_04	C-cutting boards? You mean...for cooking?\c\nThe plates we’re after aren’t dinner plates, so this\nis hardly the time for cooking![VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev107200_talk_05	How you complain for one shirking his own work\nthis very moment.\c\nPoor Ginter of the Ginkgo Guild must have his\nhands full with you.[VAR 0114(000D)]
msg_ev107200_talk_06	[VAR BD06(0000)]But honest work earns honest pay. Here you are,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]—a reward for the\r\nwood\r\nyou’ve\r\nbrought me.[VAR 0114(000D)]
msg_ev107200_sys_01	You received the Pixie Plate!
msg_ev107200_talk_07	THAT’S ONE OF THE PLATES WE WERE\nLOOKING FOR![VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev107200_talk_08	Ahem. Apologies. That’s indeed one of the\nplates that we’ve been searching for.[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev107200_talk_09	What do you mean, a plate? Let me see\nthat again!\c\nHmm. This does rather look like one of the plates\nyou’ve been tracking down.[VAR 0114(000D)]
msg_ev107200_talk_10	While the engravings upon it made it less than\naccommodating as a cutting board...\c\nwhatever ingredients crossed it certainly gained\na more pleasant flavor. Perhaps that was the\r\nboard’s power—the plate’s power, rather.[VAR 0114(000D)]
msg_ev107200_talk_11	Well, no more needs saying. What do you two\nintend to do now?[VAR 0114(000D)]
msg_ev107200_talk_12	Well, we’ve managed to collect quite a lot of\nplates by now...\c\nBut I still don’t know what we’re to do with them,\nexactly. It’s just a hunch, but perhaps we should\r\nhave a look around the Celestica Ruins?[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev107200_talk_13	Those ruins contain statues of both Dialga and\nPalkia. They might hold more secrets...[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev107200_talk_14	I see. A fine pretext to continue shirking your\nmercantile duties to crawl about in old ruins as\r\nyou so enjoy. On with you, then![VAR 0114(000D)]
msg_ev107200_talk_15	I don’t need you to tell me! I’m going![VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev107200_talk_16	The Celestica Ruins, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nI’ll see you there![VAR 0114(000C)]

msg_evchap10_null_36	[~ 237]
msg_ev107400_talk_01	Have a look at this, [VAR 0100(0000)]...[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev107400_talk_02	This statue has been kept here, far from the\nstatues of Dialga and Palkia...\r\nBroken and shattered, and yet it remains...[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev107400_talk_03	Do you know what it is?[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev107400_list_01	I think so...
msg_ev107400_list_02	Not at all...
msg_ev107400_talk_04	Of course you would. You’re the greatest wielder\nof Pokémon this land knows. The one who could\r\nbring low even Dialga and Palkia.[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev107400_talk_05	Oh? You’re the greatest wielder of Pokémon this\nland knows. The one who could bring low even\r\nDialga and Palkia. But it seems certain things are\r\nbeyond even your grasp...[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev107400_talk_06	This crumbling statue once was the figure of a\nPokémon—one that was equal to both Dialga\r\nand Palkia, yet banished from our world...\c\nThe great Pokémon Giratina![VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev107400_talk_07	It was banished for its violence, left to dwell\nin a world on the reverse side of our own.\c\nIt is a being that has lain in wait for the chance\nto bare its fangs in defiance and tear down\r\nArceus itself.[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev107400_talk_08	Now tell me, if this Giratina desires more than\nanything else to challenge almighty Arceus...\r\nwhere do you think it might appear?[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev107400_list_03	Mount Coronet
msg_ev107400_list_04	The Temple of Sinnoh
msg_ev107400_talk_09	Exactly! Where one is closer to the heavens than\nany other place in Hisui!\r\n...And where the space-time rift first opened![VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev107400_talk_10	Huhuhuh... HAHAHAHAHA![VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev107400_talk_11	I can feel it... We are getting closer to uncovering\nthe secrets of this world! I daresay the excitement\r\nis loosening my lips more than it should, but...[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev107400_talk_12	You see, ever since I was young, whenever I met\nwith something painful or heartbreaking...\c\nI couldn’t help but wonder why life was so unfair.\nWhy I was cursed to live through such things.\c\nOf course, I imagine we all go through something\nlike that.[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev107400_talk_13	Eventually, I chose to direct all my energy into\nmy own natural curiosity and ambition.[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev107400_talk_14	And what tickled my curiosity more strongly than\nanything were the mysteries to be found in\r\nlegends, in history, in ruins...\c\nYou see, I fancied that by unraveling these\nmysteries, I could find out how the world itself\r\ncame to be—and with that knowledge, maybe\r\neven forge a new, better world![VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev107400_talk_15	Now, if we can find the realm that exists on the\nreverse side of our world...and meet the creator’s\r\nunwanted child banished therein...\c\nperhaps then we’ll be able to understand the\nnature of almighty Sinnoh itself![VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev107400_talk_16	Don’t you want to see it with your own eyes?!\nWe must make for the Temple of Sinnoh at\r\nMount Coronet’s peak![VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev107400_talk_17	Dialga and Palkia both appeared from within\nthe rift that once gaped open there, didn’t they?\c\nIf these plates can call anything at all, it seems\nlikely that is where it would appear![VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_evchap10_null_32	[~ 259]
msg_ev108000_talk_01	The temple lies in ruins now... Columns cracked\nand broken... Like pillars now turned into spears,\r\nstabbing into the heavens...[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev108000_talk_02	Well, I detect a distinct lack of Giratina.[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev108000_talk_03	Hmm? Is something bothering you?[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev108000_talk_04	Ah, I do beg your pardon. I suppose I must seem\nto be behaving strangely![VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev108000_talk_05	I daresay you deserve to know what I’m really\nafter by now.[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev108000_talk_06	Ever since I became convinced that Arceus really\ndoes exist, there has been one question that\r\nconsumed my thoughts...\c\nHow can I meet such a being myself?[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev108000_talk_07	It was in an attempt to answer this question that\nI originally sought out Giratina and had it tear\r\nopen that rift in space and time...\c\nAfter all, Giratina wished to stand against Arceus.\nBut that didn’t do the trick...[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev108000_talk_08	So then I had you gather the fragments of the\nall-encompassing deity, just as the murals of\r\nthe ruins directed.[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev108000_talk_09	Eighteen plates said to be the fragments of the\nall-encompassing deity...\c\nYou hold in your hands seventeen of them. So,\nyou must be wondering: Where is the last one?[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev108000_talk_10	Why, it’s right here![VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev108000_talk_11	Now hand over the plates you gathered! I will be\nthe one to bring them all together![VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev108000_talk_12	My desire to meet Arceus cannot be contained\nany longer! I need to know what it is!\r\nI MUST know what it is![VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev108000_talk_13	If I can meet Arceus myself, then I may also be\nable to subjugate its power... And using that,\r\nI will attempt to create a new, better world![VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev108000_talk_14	Of course, if I create a brand-new world, then\nthis Hisui region that we currently exist in will\r\nbe undone and returned to nothing.\c\nYou, everyone you know, and all the Pokémon\nliving here will vanish in an instant, as if you’d\r\nnever been.[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev108000_talk_15	If you want to keep this world from disappearing,\nthen face me in battle!\c\nNot that you have a choice. Even if you don’t\nwish to battle me, I’m not above using force to\r\ntake those plates from you.[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev108000_talk_16	Almighty Arceus above! Behold the glorious\nconclusion to my long effort![VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_evchap10_null_10	[~ 276]
msg_ev108010_talk_01	Why? How?![VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev108010_talk_02	I’ve devoted myself to Arceus beyond any other!\nI worshiped it as the creator of our entire world!\r\nI bent all of my passion and interest to its study!\c\nAll the time I’ve spent poring over the legends...\nEverything that I’ve done—![VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev108010_talk_03	You outsider! It’s almost as if you were spat out\nof the space-time rift just to get in my way![VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev108010_talk_04	No...no, this isn’t finished yet![VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev108010_talk_05	Can’t you feel it? The chill creeping through your\nveins—the eldritch presence icing your heart?[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev108010_talk_06	Bishaan!
msg_evchap10_null_11	[~ 283]
msg_ev108020_talk_01	Bishaaan...
msg_ev108020_talk_02	Turning tail and running? From this puny\nHUMAN? Pathetic![VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev108020_talk_03	I was the one to feed you the power you needed\nso that you could take on Arceus![VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev108020_talk_04	I was the one who gave you the chance to claw\nopen that space-time rift, driving the deity of\r\nspace and the deity of time mad so that you\r\ncould drag the creator out from hiding![VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev108020_talk_05	How? How could this happen?! Almighty Arceus,\nif you have any heart within you, then tell me...[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev108020_talk_06	The blood of the ancient Sinnoh people flows in\nmy veins, does it not?! What is it, then, that you\r\nfind so lacking in me?![VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev108020_talk_07	Do you mean to tell me that this world doesn’t\nneed to be remade?[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev108020_talk_08	[VAR BD06(0000)]I can’t live with such questions... I can’t bear not\nsatisfying this ache to know!\c\nAnswer me, then, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nDo you\r\nhave\r\nsome\r\ndream\r\nthat\r\npropels\r\nyou,\r\nas\r\nI’ve had?[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev108020_list_01	I do!
msg_ev108020_list_02	I don’t know.
msg_ev108020_talk_09	So you do...\c\nDoubtless that dream of yours would never leave\nroom for the dreams of one like me...[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev108020_talk_10	You don’t even know...\c\nThen perhaps the day will come when you will\nsuffer and agonize as I do now...[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev108020_talk_11	I am the great wielder of Pokémon. And you...\nYou battle alongside your Pokémon.\c\nIn the end, I was alone... But not you.\c\nYou will fight together with your Pokémon to\nseize whatever dreams you have.[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev108020_talk_12	Here. Take it...\c\nTake the plate that started me on this path—\nthe plate I once received from Giratina.\c\nMy journey is over. My story ended when I lost\nto you.[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev108020_sys_13	You received the Spooky Plate from Volo!
msg_ev108020_talk_14	I suppose now you’ve gathered all of the plates\nsaid to exist in this land of Hisui.[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev108020_talk_15	The Celestica Flute transformed...into the\nAzure Flute!
msg_ev108020_talk_16	So that’s...that’s it... The Azure Flute. Heh.\nIt comes to you.[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev108020_talk_17	So Arceus wishes to meet you... Of all people,\nyou had to be the one...\c\nIs that why you were brought to this world?[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev108020_talk_18	Gah! I’ve no desire to watch from the sidelines as\nArceus comes to you!\c\nAnd I absolutely cannot accept a world in which\nyou would ever manage to defeat Arceus...[VAR 0114(000C)]
msg_ev108020_talk_19	Someday, I’ll solve every riddle in the legends of\nHisui’s Pokémon.\c\nAnd on that day, I’ll stand before Arceus at last—\nNo, I will CONQUER it!\c\nNo matter how many years, how many decades,\nhow many centuries it takes me![VAR 0114(000C)]

msg_sub114_talk_08	Ah, yes, Landorus—the Pokémon hailed as the\nGuardian of the Fields.\c\nIt seems it can be glimpsed in the Obsidian\nFieldlands. Perhaps you’d be so good as to catch\r\nit for me?[VAR 0114(000D)]

msg_sub202_0020_list_03	Where should we look?
msg_sub202_0020_talk_04	Perhaps that fancy map of yours can show\nus something.[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_sub202_0020_talk_05	Munch!
msg_sub202_0020_sys_06	Check your map and investigate the locations\nmarked with “?”.

msg_sub202_0020_talk_10	Mun!
msg_sub202_0020_talk_11	Are you worried about the rainstorm, Munchlax?[VAR 0114(000F)]

msg_sub202_0030_talk_01	Thank you for your investigation in the\nObsidian Fieldlands![VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_sub202_0030_talk_02	Did you learn anything about these massive\nmass outbreaks?[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_sub202_0030_list_02	They come in rainstorms
msg_sub202_0030_talk_03	It’s always pouring rain
msg_sub202_0030_talk_04	What could that mean? Do Pokémon gather when\nthere’s especially heavy rain?[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_sub202_0030_talk_05	I wonder whether Munchlax was reacting to the\nrainstorm, or to the massive mass outbreak itself.[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_sub202_0030_talk_06	We’ll just have to investigate further. But how\nbest to do so...[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_sub202_0030_talk_07	We’ve had a good look around the Obsidian\nFieldlands, but it’s only raised more questions...[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_sub202_0030_talk_08	That frown doesn’t suit you at all.[VAR 0114(0011)]
msg_sub202_0030_talk_09	Oh, Mistress Calaba! Well, you see...[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_sub202_0030_talk_10	Mass outbreaks that occur during rainstorms?\nI’ve never heard of such a thing.[VAR 0114(0011)]
msg_sub202_0030_talk_11	But of course, life is full of surprises.[VAR 0114(0011)]
msg_sub202_0030_talk_12	After all, it’s not often that Pokémon from beyond\nour world appear at the Temple of Sinnoh, either.[VAR 0114(0011)]
msg_sub202_0030_talk_13	Perhaps these Pokémon are reacting to the\narrival of mighty Palkia.[VAR 0114(0011)]
msg_sub202_0030_talk_14	Why don’t we head back to Jubilife Village?\c\nArezu’s shop may be a good place to visit.\nThat girl’s place is awfully popular, after all—\r\nand where people gather, information abounds.[VAR 0114(0011)]
msg_sub202_0030_talk_15	Of course! The hairdresser’s![VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_sub202_0030_list_16	Good thinking!
msg_sub202_0030_list_17	That might just work
msg_sub202_0030_talk_18	If anyone there has seen one of these massive\nmass outbreaks, they might be willing to share\r\nthe details with us.[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_sub202_0030_talk_19	I agree. We won’t learn anything new if we\nsimply stay put.[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_sub202_0030_talk_20	It’s settled, then. I’ll wait for you at\nthe hairdresser’s.[VAR 0114(0011)]
msg_sub202_0030_talk_21	Perhaps we should head to Arezu’s shop as well.[VAR 0114(000F)]

msg_sub203_0010_end	[~ 97]
msg_sub203_0020_talk_01	I heard all about those massive mass outbreaks.\nI bet they’re some sort of Pokémon festival![VAR 0114(0012)]
msg_sub203_0020_talk_02	It’s like what I heard from a customer who came\nhere from Johto.\c\nApparently, on nights with a full moon, Clefairy\nget together and dance![VAR 0114(0012)]
msg_sub203_0020_talk_03	It’s basically a gathering of Pokémon that only\nhappens when certain conditions are met.\c\nSounds pretty similar to massive mass outbreaks,\ndon’tcha think?[VAR 0114(0012)]
msg_sub203_0020_talk_04	So massive mass outbreaks could be a festival\nfor Pokémon to enjoy the rainstorms![VAR 0114(0012)]
msg_sub203_0020_list_05	You might have a point
msg_sub203_0020_list_06	You really think so?
msg_sub203_0020_talk_07	It seems to me you’re still biting your tongue,\nArezu. Have you heard anything else?[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_sub203_0020_talk_08	Well, I did hear something weird from a Diamond\nClan friend of mine...[VAR 0114(0012)]
msg_sub203_0020_list_09	What was it?
msg_sub203_0020_list_10	Go on...
msg_sub203_0020_talk_11	They said they saw a mass outbreak of alphas in\nthe Crimson Mirelands![VAR 0114(0012)]
msg_sub203_0020_talk_12	But seriously, do alphas ever gather in groups?\nMy friend must’ve made a mistake, right?[VAR 0114(0012)]
msg_sub203_0020_talk_13	Alphas grouping together... If this is part of a\nmassive mass outbreak, it sounds dangerous.[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_sub203_0020_talk_14	Mun...
msg_sub203_0020_talk_15	Even the Lady of the Ridge would be no match\nfor a mass outbreak of alphas...[VAR 0114(0012)]
msg_sub203_0020_talk_17	[VAR BD06(0000)]It’s natural to worry about the unknown.\c\nThat’s why [VAR 0100(0000)] is\ninvestigating\r\nthis\r\nfor\r\nus,\r\nno?\r\nTo put our concerns to rest.[VAR 0114(0011)]
msg_sub203_0020_talk_16	You’re right! It seems our next step is to\ninvestigate the Crimson Mirelands.[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_sub203_0025_talk_01	I’ll await you at the front gate. Come join\nme when you’re ready to set out.[VAR 0114(000F)]

msg_sub203_0030_talk_01	It seems a massive mass outbreak has sprung\nup here in the Crimson Mirelands, too.\c\nLet’s try to determine if this phenomenon occurs\nhere as it does in the Obsidian Fieldlands.[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_sub203_0030_talk_02	Hey ho, little people!\nNo need to fret—Melli has arrived.[VAR 0114(0016)]
msg_sub203_0030_talk_03	What do you want?[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_sub203_0030_talk_04	I heard rumors that you’ve been investigating\n“massive mass outbreaks” or some such.\c\nBut I, Melli, have already solved the mystery! All\nthat remains is to gather evidence.[VAR 0114(0016)]
msg_sub203_0030_list_05	Wow!
msg_sub203_0030_list_06	Really?
msg_sub203_0030_talk_07	Not bad, Melli![VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_sub203_0030_talk_08	The reason these Pokémon have been\nmysteriously gathering in rainstorms is...[VAR 0114(0016)]
msg_sub203_0030_list_09	Out with it already!
msg_sub203_0030_list_10	Is...?
msg_sub203_0030_talk_11	...to give praise to the great Melli, naturally![VAR 0114(0016)]
msg_sub203_0030_talk_12	[~ 130]
msg_sub203_0030_talk_13	[~ 131]
msg_sub203_0030_talk_14	Don’t look so sour, you two![VAR 0114(0016)]
msg_sub203_0030_talk_31	I realize it’s a difficult truth to accept right away,\nbut the awe I inspire—as both sun and shadow to\r\nAdaman—is clearly apparent to Pokémon![VAR 0114(0016)]
msg_sub203_0030_talk_15	And as thanks for your adorable efforts in proving\nmy theory true, I’ll give you this generous reward.[VAR 0114(0016)]
msg_sub203_0030_talk_16	Go on, take them! They’re Aguav Berries—quite\na rarity here in Hisui, you know![VAR 0114(0016)]
msg_sub203_0030_talk_17	As for why these Pokémon gather during\nrainstorms—well, that’s surely to represent how\r\nI’m simply overflowing with wonderful qualities.\c\nAnd with that nugget of wisdom, I shall be off![VAR 0114(0016)]
msg_sub203_0030_talk_18	He was very shy and withdrawn as a child, until\none day when he announced he was going to\r\nwork hard to help Adaman.\c\nI was happy to see him grow more optimistic, but\nI fear he may have taken that to...extremes.[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_sub203_0030_talk_19	But Aguav Berries... Where could he have\nfound them?[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_sub203_0030_talk_20	Munch!
msg_sub203_0030_talk_21	Munchlax! Did you just eat some of the\nAguav Berries?![VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_sub203_0030_talk_30	Munchlax gobbled up five of the Aguav Berries!
msg_sub203_0030_talk_22	Munch-munch!!!
msg_sub203_0030_talk_23	What’s this? It looks like your fancy map is\nresponding to Munchlax again.[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_sub203_0030_talk_24	Hm. Now the map shows not only outbreak\nlocations, but the Pokémon there as well.[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_sub203_0030_talk_25	What does this mean, Munchlax?[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_sub203_0030_talk_26	Mun!
msg_sub203_0030_talk_27	So if we keep feeding Munchlax Aguav Berries,\nwe’ll be able to learn more about these outbreaks?[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_sub203_0030_talk_28	Munchlax... What exactly is it you’re trying to\nget us to understand?[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_sub203_0030_talk_29	Whatever this all means, please investigate three\nmassive mass outbreak locations in the Crimson\r\nMirelands, so we can compare these outbreaks to\r\nthose we found in the Obsidian Fieldlands.[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_sub203_0030_end	[~ 150]
msg_sub203_0040_talk_01	I hear you’ve finished your investigation in the\nCrimson Mirelands!\r\nWell done, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_sub203_0040_talk_02	Irida is here to help us.[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_sub203_0040_talk_03	What happens twice will happen thrice—or so\nthey say.\c\nMassive mass outbreaks seem likely to occur in\nthe Cobalt Coastlands and other areas as well,\r\nso I’ve been discussing the issue with Irida.[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_sub203_0040_talk_04	Why don’t we demonstrate to her what has been\nkeeping us so busy?\c\nWe can turn our investigation to the Cobalt\nCoastlands next.[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_sub203_0040_talk_05	Munch!
msg_sub203_0040_talk_06	Ah, yes, Munchlax. I know what’s been keeping\nyou busy is eating.\r\nDon’t worry—you’ll get your Berries.[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_sub203_0040_talk_07	But I still wonder...\c\nWhat lies behind Munchlax’s strange reaction\nto eating Aguav Berries?[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_sub203_0040_talk_08	How does he know which Pokémon are gathering\nwhere during a massive mass outbreak?[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_sub203_0040_list_09	He’s some kinda genius?
msg_sub203_0040_list_10	He’s got super powers?
msg_sub203_0040_talk_11	Perhaps...\c\nHopefully our investigations will shed some light\non this mystery.[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_sub203_0040_talk_12	Well, let me offer you a hand. I’ve learned some\nthings about massive mass outbreaks myself![VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_sub203_0040_talk_13	I knew the leader of the Pearl Clan could help us![VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_sub203_0040_talk_14	Mysterious goings-on in vast Hisui pique my\ninterest, after all![VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_sub203_0040_talk_15	And on top of that, we’re friends! I’ll always\ncome if you ask for help![VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_sub203_0040_list_16	Friends?
msg_sub203_0040_list_17	Since when?
msg_sub203_0040_talk_18	We’d seen each other around before, but after\ntalking more at the Harmony Festival, we found\r\nwe agreed on a lot of things.[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_sub203_0040_talk_19	Such as how exactly we think Adaman is doing\nas a leader.[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_sub203_0040_talk_20	And we decided we’d help each other out,\ndespite being from different clans.[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_sub203_0040_talk_21	Anyway, that’s how I got involved with the\ninvestigation in the coastlands![VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_sub203_0040_talk_22	And I heard from Iscan and Lina that they’d both\nseen something that was like a mass outbreak...\r\nbut stranger![VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_sub203_0040_talk_23	What are your thoughts on these massive mass\noutbreaks, Irida?[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_sub203_0040_talk_24	Well, I wonder what about them causes Pokémon\nto flock together this way...[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_sub203_0040_talk_25	Perhaps there’s been some shift in space because\nof mighty Palkia’s appearance?[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_sub203_0040_talk_26	I’d certainly be glad to have more Pokémon\naround—it would help Hisui flourish...[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_sub203_0040_talk_27	But it’s too early to conclude it’s all for the best.\nHordes of strong Pokémon could be dangerous.[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_sub203_0040_talk_28	I’ll be sure to warn Lina to be careful, too![VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_sub203_0040_talk_29	I’ll head to Jubilife Village once I wrap up a few\nthings here.\c\nWe can meet at the front gates when it’s time to\nset out on our next investigation.[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_sub203_0040_talk_29_free	Please investigate three massive mass outbreaks\nin the Cobalt Coastlands![VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_sub204_0005_talk_08	The next step of our investigation is to look for\nmassive mass outbreaks in the Cobalt Coastlands!\r\nThanks as always for all the help![VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_sub204_0005_talk_10	Are you ready?[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_sub204_0005_talk_01	We’re going to investigate the Cobalt\nCoastlands. Are you ready to set out?[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_sub204_0005_talk_03	What a fine surprise, meeting you two while out\nfetching supplies for our settlement.[VAR 0114(0017)]
msg_sub204_0005_talk_04	Calaba filled me in. You’re looking into mass\noutbreaks that happen during rainstorms?\c\nWell then, I’ll tell you what I recommend:\nSticky Globs![VAR 0114(0017)]
msg_sub204_0005_talk_05	Hitting a Pokémon with a Sticky Glob will slow it\nright down!\c\nI bought the recipe at the craftworks myself, by\nrequest from the settlement.[VAR 0114(0017)]
msg_sub204_0005_talk_06	I’d better get back to the icelands. Not that it’ll\ntake much time with well-trained legs like these![VAR 0114(0017)]
msg_sub204_0005_talk_07	Interesting. The Pearl Clan is recommending the\nGalaxy Team’s Sticky Globs.[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_sub204_0005_talk_02	Right then. Let’s set off for the Beachside Camp.[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_sub204_0005_talk_09	It seems we’ve arrived in time to catch another\nmassive mass outbreak.[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_sub204_0005_talk_11	Remember Gaeric’s advice. Perhaps those Sticky\nGlobs could be a big help.\c\nNow then, let’s begin our research.[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_sub204_0005_talk_12	You can let me know if you wish to give Munchlax\nsome Aguav Berries, as well.\c\nIt will grant you a bit of insight into the Pokémon\ngathering in these massive mass outbreaks.[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_sub203_0040_end	[~ 193]
msg_sub204_0010_talk_01	It seems the Survey Corps really does get the job\ndone! I’m glad I asked you for help.[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_sub204_0010_talk_02	I’m also glad we can get information from the\nPearl Clan more easily now.[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_sub204_0010_talk_03	[VAR BD06(0000)]You’ve got more Survey Corps members than\njust [VAR 0100(0000)] at your service,\r\ntoo![VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_sub204_0010_talk_03_m	I’ve got even more information from the Survey\nCorps to offer, Mai![VAR 0114(0007)]
msg_sub204_0010_talk_04	Captain Cyllene ordered me and the professor\nto help study these massive mass outbreaks.\r\nThey’re great for checking off research tasks![VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_sub204_0010_talk_04_m	Professor Laventon and I have been researching\nthese massive mass outbreaks, too—Captain\r\nCyllene’s orders.[VAR 0114(0007)]
msg_sub204_0010_talk_05	I’d be grateful to hear about anything\nyou’ve discovered.[VAR 0114(000F)]

msg_sub204_0010_talk_07	I want to become an even more amazing Survey\nCorps member. And to do that, I need to battle\r\nyou, [VAR 0189(0000)]![VAR 0114(0006)]

msg_sub204_0010_talk_12	Meet me at Ginkgo Landing when you’re ready!\nA beach seems fitting for a showdown, yeah?[VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_sub204_0010_talk_12_m	I’ll be waiting for you at Ginkgo Landing. I’m\ntaking this seriously, so I hope you do too![VAR 0114(0007)]

msg_sub204_0010_talk_10	You fell from the sky into our world, and I don’t\nwant that to be for nothing—for you or for me!\c\nWe’re gonna keep on working for the Survey\nCorps together...so I’m gonna show you that\r\nI can beat you![VAR 0114(0006)]
msg_sub204_0010_talk_10_m	You’ve solved a lot of problems for us since\nyou fell from the sky.\c\nBut I still have more Survey Corps experience!\nI need to prove that you can depend on me![VAR 0114(0007)]

msg_sub205_0030_talk_08	Oh, and I did see one of those massive mass\noutbreaks on my way here to find you...[VAR 0114(0010)]
msg_sub205_0030_talk_09	I wonder if they might be caused by the geology\nof the place where they occur?\c\nPerhaps there is some mysterious kind of stone in\nthe ground which draws Pokémon near...[VAR 0114(0010)]

msg_sub205_0030_list_03	Mai said that?

msg_sub205_0040_talk_09	If you’re ready, shall we set out to investigate?[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_sub206_0005_talk_01	Remember that we make for the Coronet\nHighlands. Are you ready to brave them?[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_sub206_0005_talk_02	Very good. We should start out from the\nHighlands Camp, then.[VAR 0114(000F)]

msg_sub206_0010_talk_10	[~ 285]
msg_sub206_0010_talk_01	Now then, let us continue our investigation into\nthese outbreaks here in the Coronet Highlands![VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_sub206_0010_talk_02	[VAR 1003][VAR 0189(0000)]![VAR 0114(0018)]
msg_sub206_0010_talk_03	And Mai![VAR 0114(0018)]
msg_sub206_0010_list_01	What brings you here?
msg_sub206_0010_list_02	Is something the matter?
msg_sub206_0010_talk_04	I hurried here ’cause of a vision my clairvoyance\nshowed me!\c\nSome poor soul was running for their life from\na bunch of alphas. I just barely saved them![VAR 0114(0018)]
msg_sub206_0010_talk_05	[VAR BD06(0000)]It’s as I feared, then... These massive mass\noutbreaks really are growing out of hand.\c\n[VAR 1003][VAR 0100(0000)]! We must endeavor to find\nthe\r\ntruth\r\nbehind\r\nwhy\r\nthey\r\nkeep happening![VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_sub206_0010_talk_06	Big packs of Pokémon might not be much\ntrouble if you’ve got a trusty partner, but if you\r\ndon’t... Eeep! I’m scared just thinking about it![VAR 0114(0018)]
msg_sub206_0010_talk_07	You did well to save that person, Sabi. You’re as\nfine a protector as any lord or lady Pokémon![VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_sub206_0010_talk_08	Thanks, Mai! If my clairvoyance shows me anyone\nelse in trouble, I’ll do my best to save them too!\c\nJust be careful while you’re out here, OK?[VAR 0114(0018)]
msg_sub206_0010_talk_09	She’s right. I know how strong you are, but we\nshould move with caution here.[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_sub206_0010_talk_08_free	We should investigate at least three outbreak\nlocations here in the Coronet Highlands\r\nbefore we can consider our work done.[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_sub206_0010_end	[~ 298]
msg_sub206_0020_talk_01	Good work out there. It seems we may have\nlearned all we can from the highlands for now.[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_sub206_0020_talk_02	There you two are. Hope your investigation’s\ngoing all right.[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_sub206_0020_list_01	We’re doing great!
msg_sub206_0020_list_02	What are you up to?
msg_sub206_0020_talk_03	I heard folks in our clan and the Pearl Clan\nare all helping investigate these massive mass\r\noutbreaks, or whatever you call ’em.\c\nAnd I thought, what kind of leader would sit back\nand do nothing while you’re all working?[VAR 0114(000A)]

msg_sub206_0020_talk_05	[~ 305]
msg_sub206_0020_talk_06	[~ 306]
msg_sub206_0020_talk_07	So I figured I’d grab whatever supplies I could\nfind that might come in handy for you.\r\nHere—materials for those Sticky Glob things![VAR 0114(000A)]

msg_sub206_0020_talk_12	Don’t make fun, Mai. I’m trying to help![VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_sub206_0020_talk_13	You misunderstand me, Adaman. As the sister\nwho helped raise you, I’m truly proud to see how\r\nfar you’ve come.[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_sub206_0020_talk_25	Munch-munch.
msg_sub206_0020_talk_14	[VAR BD06(0000)]Listen, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nI’ve been wondering...[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_sub206_0020_talk_15	Do you think these massive mass outbreaks\ncould be some sort of trial from mighty Dialga\r\nor mighty Palkia?[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_sub206_0020_list_03	It’s possible
msg_sub206_0020_list_04	I mean...maybe?
msg_sub206_0020_talk_16	It kind of feels like it, right?\c\nAs if someone’s telling us, “If you’ve got the guts\nto face a real test with your partners, take on\r\nthese Pokémon. Otherwise, stand back.”[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_sub206_0020_talk_17	Quite like you to see it that way, Adaman.[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_sub206_0020_talk_18	Yeah, well, I’d love to stay and talk, but I’ve got\nan appointment to keep with that Beni fellow.\c\nI’ve been trying to get him to teach me his tricks.[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_sub206_0020_talk_19	[~ 322]
msg_sub206_0020_talk_20	[~ 323]
msg_sub206_0020_list_05	You mean his cooking?
msg_sub206_0020_list_06	You mean his ninja skills?
msg_sub206_0020_talk_21	I want to know his recipes AND his ninja tricks!\c\nOnce I do, I’ll give you a proper demonstration.\nBut in the meantime, stay safe as you investigate![VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_sub206_0020_talk_22	My, my. It would seem having a trusted\npartner causes one to view these outbreaks\r\nin a rather different light...[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_sub206_0020_talk_23	Now then. The Alabaster Icelands still await—\none more steep hurdle for us to overcome.[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_sub206_0020_talk_24	Muuunch!
msg_sub206_0020_list_25	You said it!
msg_sub206_0020_list_26	Muuuuuunch!
msg_sub206_0020_talk_27	It appears Munchlax is eager to continue as well!\c\nWe’ll await you at Jubilife’s front gate as usual.\nJoin us when you’re ready for another survey.[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_sub207_0005_talk_03	Our last item of research is to look into massive\nmass outbreaks in the Alabaster Icelands.\r\nLet’s finish this—together![VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_sub207_0005_talk_04	If you’re ready, shall we embark on\nour investigation?[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_sub207_0005_talk_01	We make for the Alabaster Icelands this time.\nAre you ready?[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_sub207_0005_talk_02	Good! Then let’s head to the Snowfields Camp.[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_sub206_0020_end	[~ 337]
msg_sub207_0010_talk_14	[~ 338]
msg_sub207_0010_talk_01	The cold here seems to cut right through you...[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_sub207_0010_talk_16	You actually went to the trouble of\nordering that ugly hat to be made?\r\nWhat a shame it suits you so poorly.[VAR 0114(0016)]
msg_sub207_0010_talk_17	It suits me just fine! It’s distinguishing and sturdy\nenough to last for decades to come.[VAR 0114(0010)]
msg_sub207_0010_talk_07	What are you two doing here?[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_sub207_0010_talk_08	I came to advise you that the massive mass\noutbreaks seen here in the Alabaster Icelands\r\nseem slightly different than the others.[VAR 0114(0010)]
msg_sub207_0010_talk_09	The outbreaks happen during rainstorms in other\nareas, but here they seem to be tied to blizzards![VAR 0114(0016)]
msg_sub207_0010_talk_02	Blizzards, you say...?\c\nIt could just be the cold environment, of course,\nbut I have to wonder if there’s more to it...[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_sub207_0010_talk_03	Well, we’d better get to it. I think we should look\ninto more outbreak locations than usual this time.[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_sub207_0010_list_01	Better get started
msg_sub207_0010_list_02	More than usual?
msg_sub207_0010_talk_04	I know increasing the scope of our investigation\nis a lot to ask at this point...[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_sub207_0010_talk_05	[VAR BD06(0000)]And even for someone with your skill,\n[VAR 0100(0000)], it will take a long\r\ntime\r\nto\r\ncheck\r\nso\r\nmany\r\nareas by yourself.[VAR 0114(0010)]
msg_sub207_0010_talk_06	It’s a good thing I’m here to help you out then,\nisn’t it?\c\nAnd I suppose even Lian might be of some use.[VAR 0114(0016)]
msg_sub207_0010_list_03	I’d appreciate the help!
msg_sub207_0010_list_04	I’m counting on you!
msg_sub207_0010_talk_10	This will be your first time investigating these\noutbreaks, won’t it, you two?\c\nTry not to overstrain yourselves.[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_sub207_0010_talk_11	[VAR BD06(0000)]Certainly!\c\nSo to sum up, [VAR 0189(0000)] will\nfocus\r\non\r\njust\r\nthree\r\nareas,\r\nas\r\n[VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]she’s been doing till now.\c\nMeanwhile, Sliggoo and I will handle the\nremaining areas.[VAR 0114(0010)]
msg_sub207_0010_talk_12	There’s something wrong with your math there,\nlittle man... You’ve left me out of the equation![VAR 0114(0016)]
msg_sub207_0010_talk_18	So you can do basic math, can you?[VAR 0114(0010)]
msg_sub207_0010_talk_19	Hmph! I know how to subtract you from this\nassignment, for starters!\c\nI will finish all the remaining areas on my own—\nyou needn’t factor in.[VAR 0114(0016)]
msg_sub207_0010_talk_15	I can’t tell if they hate each other or if they’re\nboth enjoying this...\c\nEither way, I imagine they never would have\ncrossed paths if it hadn’t been for you.[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_sub207_0010_talk_13	For now, let us focus on investigating\nthe outbreaks here in the icelands.[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_sub207_0010_talk_13_free	You need to investigate three areas here in the\nAlabaster Icelands.[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_sub207_0010_end	[~ 362]
msg_sub207_0020_talk_01	So, you’ve finished checking the three areas you\nwere charged with in the icelands.[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_sub207_0020_talk_02	[~ 364]
msg_sub207_0020_talk_03	[~ 365]

msg_sub207_0020_talk_06	[~ 368]
msg_sub207_0020_talk_07	Munch!
msg_sub207_0020_talk_08	I’ve gotten word from Melli, too.\nSays he’s about ready to wrap it up.[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_sub207_0020_talk_09	Lian said he and Melli worked together to\ninvestigate the last outbreak![VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_sub207_0020_talk_10	Well then, it seems we’re done here. You’ve\nworked tirelessly to investigate all across Hisui!\c\nBut we still don’t know what causes these massive\nmass outbreaks...\c\nAnd they pose a threat to anyone without strong\npartners at their side.[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_sub207_0020_talk_11	It’d be nice if these outbreaks didn’t put anyone\nin danger, but things rarely work out that easily.[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_sub207_0020_talk_12	Perhaps these outbreaks are someone’s way of\ntelling us that we must better understand the\r\nPokémon with which we share vast Hisui![VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_sub207_0020_talk_13	Yeah... I could get behind that idea.[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_sub207_0020_talk_15	But for now, we’d better get going if we want\nto make it on time![VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_sub207_0020_talk_14	Come along, you two![VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_sub207_0020_end	[~ 378]
msg_sub207_0030_talk_07	This is the place![VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_sub207_0030_talk_08	And we picked the perfect time.[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_sub207_0030_talk_01	What do you think?[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_sub207_0030_list_01	It’s beautiful!
msg_sub207_0030_list_02	It’s amazing!
msg_sub207_0030_talk_02	This lovely space, given to us by mighty Palkia...[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_sub207_0030_talk_03	And this fleeting time mighty Dialga gave us.[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_sub207_0030_talk_04	Such a beautiful view is only possible because we\nhave both. Together.[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_sub207_0030_talk_05	Hisui means so much to me. My love for it is\nas vast as the land itself.[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_sub207_0030_talk_06	Tell me, [VAR 0189(0000)].\c\nDid you enjoy surveying this land once again?[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_sub207_0030_list_07	It was a lot of fun
msg_sub207_0030_list_08	I don’t know...
msg_sub207_0030_talk_09	Was it? I suppose it’s always thrilling to have a\nmystery to delve into. I enjoyed it, too.[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_sub207_0030_talk_10	You don’t? I suppose we still don’t know for sure\nwhat has caused these outbreaks, after all...\r\nBut we can continue our search for answers![VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_sub207_0030_talk_11	Munch!
msg_sub207_0030_talk_12	I heard these massive mass outbreaks trigger\nsome kind of reaction in your Munchlax, Mai.\r\nIs he doing all right?[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_sub207_0030_talk_13	He seems fine. Pokémon remain mysterious\ncreatures to us. Who’s to say how he does it?\c\nI’m just grateful to him for helping us find the\noutbreaks and telling us what we’ll find at each.[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_sub207_0030_talk_14	That reminds me—I’ve spread the word that the\npeople of Hisui should be alert for massive mass\r\noutbreaks during rainstorms.[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_sub207_0030_talk_15	Thanks for that, Irida.\c\nHopefully no more poor souls will wander\ninto one unprepared and take a beating.[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_sub207_0030_talk_19	Seems like our lives are going to keep on\nchanging. And we’ll keep adapting just as fast![VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_sub207_0030_talk_16	[~ 399]
msg_sub207_0030_talk_17	[~ 400]
msg_sub207_0030_talk_18	[VAR BD06(0000)]An ever-changing Hisui...\c\nTell me, [VAR 0100(0000)], how do you\nthink\r\nthe\r\nfuture\r\npeople\r\nof\r\nHisui\r\nwill\r\nlive\r\nwith Pokémon?[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_sub207_0030_list_19	They’ll battle in gyms!
msg_sub207_0030_list_20	They’ll enter contests!
msg_sub207_0030_talk_21	In...gyms? What is a gym? And why would you\nbattle in one, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_sub207_0030_talk_29	You say they’re places where you can challenge\na skilled battler to prove your mettle?\c\nInteresting! I’d like to be the one who deems\na challenger worthy![VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_sub207_0030_talk_22	Contests of what? Strength?[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_sub207_0030_talk_30	Whoa—you’re saying people would compete to\nsee whose Pokémon’s the most eye-catching?\c\nSounds like a real sight to see! Bet you’d have to\nbe plenty close with your Pokémon to win, too.[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_sub207_0030_talk_23	Well, whatever may come of the future...\nAren’t we lucky to have been born into such\r\nfascinating, fast-changing times?[VAR 0114(000B)]
msg_sub207_0030_talk_24	You said it!\c\nNot that change is always good. And there’ll\nalways be people who don’t want change at all.\c\nBut hey, that’s life. We’ll just have to work hard\nand push on!\c\nAnd I’m glad we’ll have you with us as we do it,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]. Thanks for everything.[VAR 0114(000A)]
msg_sub207_0030_talk_28	You certainly have some curious ideas.\nBut I suppose that’s no surprise, coming from\r\nsomeone who fell out of the sky.[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_sub207_0030_talk_25	We may have finished our investigations for now,\nbut Munchlax and I will continue to help you\r\nhowever we can.[VAR 0114(000F)]
msg_sub207_0030_talk_26	Munch!
msg_sub207_0030_talk_27	You know, [VAR 0100(0000)]...\c\nPerhaps these new outbreaks truly are just a\ngift from almighty Sinnoh.\c\nA gift meant for you—for all the good changes\nyou’ve brought to all of us here in Hisui.[VAR 0114(000F)]

msg_sub250_0010_talk_03	They’re a bit of a Pokémon battle master, in fact.[VAR 0114(001B)]
msg_sub250_0010_talk_04	Think I could trouble you to face our\nsecret weapon in battle?[VAR 0114(001B)]
msg_sub250_0010_list_05	Of course!
msg_sub250_0010_list_06	Maybe later
msg_sub250_0010_talk_07	If you’re ever interested, let me know. I’d love\nto see a match between two real masters.[VAR 0114(001B)]
msg_sub250_0010_talk_08	Give us a moment then.[VAR 0114(001B)]
msg_sub250_0010_talk_09	So, I heard the news![VAR 0114(00DB)]
msg_sub250_0010_talk_10	There’s to be a face-off between two masters...[VAR 0114(00DB)]
msg_sub250_0010_talk_11	You know, I’ve heard our corps’ secret weapon\ncan even defeat alpha Pokémon![VAR 0114(00DB)]
msg_sub250_0010_talk_14	Everything’s set. Come with me![VAR 0114(001B)]
msg_sub250_0010_talk_12	Here’s our ace in the hole: Ress![VAR 0114(001B)]
msg_sub250_0010_talk_13	Please, Captain Zisu.\nI’m just a common guardsman.[VAR 0114(0030)]
msg_sub250_0010_talk_15	However...[VAR 0114(0030)]
msg_sub250_0010_talk_16	So long as I stand in defense of this gate, I have\nno intention of letting anyone defeat me![VAR 0114(0030)]
msg_sub250_talk_01	I often think on what it means to “guard.”\c\nThe word doesn’t only mean to defend, but also\nto watch over and care for something.\c\nI’m proud to guard this village.[VAR 0114(0030)]
msg_sub250_talk_02	A truly fine battle!\c\nThough if I may, I think you’re capable of a\nfar better showing than that, young recruit.\r\nNext time, I want to see you win![VAR 0114(001B)]
msg_sub250_0015_talk_01	Would you like to face Ress in battle?[VAR 0114(001B)]
msg_sub250_0020_talk_01	This was to be expected.[VAR 0114(0030)]
msg_sub250_0020_talk_02	Setting out beyond the village and battling so\nmany different Pokémon in the course of your\r\nSurvey Corps work has made you very strong.[VAR 0114(0030)]
msg_sub250_0020_talk_03	You know, my first job as a guardsman was\ncatching some Bidoof that seemed intent\r\non infiltrating the village.[VAR 0114(0030)]
msg_sub250_0020_talk_04	Since then, I’ve kept many Pokémon from passing\nthrough our gates. Sometimes I’d slip up and let\r\nsome in—goodness, would people let me have it![VAR 0114(0030)]
msg_sub250_0020_talk_05	But I also befriended some of the Pokémon, and\nbefore I knew it, we’d grown strong together.[VAR 0114(0030)]
msg_sub250_0020_talk_06	I gained so much, and all because I was trying to\nmake sure folks could live safely here.\r\nIt’s my job to keep everybody safe, isn’t it?[VAR 0114(0030)]
msg_sub250_0020_talk_07	Now—there’s one last thing I’d like to tell you.\nIf you’re heading outside the village again...\r\nstay safe out there, kid.\c\nAnd now I think I’d better get back to work.[VAR 0114(0030)]

msg_area00_talk_01	I wonder if the hole that appeared in the sky is\nsome sort of bad omen...[VAR 0114(0057)]
msg_area00_talk_01_01	I hear you passed your trial![VAR 0114(0057)]
msg_area00_talk_01_02	Honestly...I’m not sure whether battling with\nPokémon makes you brave or reckless.[VAR 0114(0057)]
msg_area00_talk_01_03	So the hole in the sky was a bad sign after all...[VAR 0114(0057)]
msg_area00_talk_01_04	A lot has changed since you fell out of the sky![VAR 0114(0057)]
msg_area00_talk_02	The Galaxy Team is made up of several corps.\nLet’s see... There’s the Security, Construction,\r\nand Agriculture Corps...and a few others besides![VAR 0114(0059)]
msg_area00_talk_03	What an odd way to dress. Is that fashionable\nwhere you’re from?[VAR 0114(0040)]
msg_area00_talk_03_01	Oh, you’re from the Survey Corps? Well then...\c\nCan you tell me how Pokémon make themselves\nso tiny?[VAR 0114(0040)]
msg_area00_talk_03_02	If I had a Pokémon pal with me, I bet I’d feel\nmuch safer wandering around the wilds...[VAR 0114(0040)]
msg_area00_talk_03_03	It’s the end of the world... I should never have\ncome to Hisui...[VAR 0114(0040)]
msg_area00_talk_03_04	I’ve heard that in some faraway regions, people\ncompete with each other by having their partner\r\nPokémon do battle.[VAR 0114(0040)]
msg_area00_talk_65	I wonder if there are other Pokémon besides\nPonyta that can look so different but are still\r\nconsidered the same species... Wouldn’t that\r\nbe fun![VAR 0114(0040)]
msg_area00_talk_04	Sure, it’s nice and peaceful inside the village...\c\nBut one step beyond the gates, and the land is\njust teeming with scary Pokémon![VAR 0114(0045)]
msg_area00_talk_04_01	Did you pass your trial? Wait—but you’d need to\nleave the village for that, right?[VAR 0114(0045)]
msg_area00_talk_04_02	It’s hard to believe you can catch Pokémon using\nthose Poké Ball things...[VAR 0114(0045)]
msg_area00_talk_04_03	I tried to catch a Pokémon, but it didn’t end\nwell... How’s a guy supposed to get close when\r\nthey keep pelting you with attacks?[VAR 0114(0045)]
msg_area00_talk_04_04	The festival sure was something, huh?\c\nI met lotsa folks from the clans and stuffed my\nface with food! Even Pokémon joined the fun!\r\nIt was great to see everyone together like that.[VAR 0114(0045)]
msg_area00_talk_05	We’ve no food for freeloaders. Survival out here\nis a daily battle, you know![VAR 0114(0048)]
msg_area00_talk_05_01	Give the Survey Corps your all, you hear?\nAfter all, we’ve no food for freeloaders.[VAR 0114(0048)]
msg_area00_talk_05_02	If you need new garments, you should head to\nthe clothier. They have an impressive selection![VAR 0114(0048)]
msg_area00_talk_05_03	If this mess gets much worse, we may have to\nabandon the village...[VAR 0114(0048)]
msg_area00_talk_05_04	I’m seeing more and more people with partner\nPokémon these days... I’m sure we have the\r\nSurvey Cor— No...we have you to thank for this.[VAR 0114(0048)]
msg_area00_talk_05_05	It’s my dream to have my own shop that\nspecializes in unbitter herbal medicines![VAR 0114(0048)]
msg_area00_talk_06	I had a rather traumatic experience when a wild\nPokémon attacked me... Now I’m scared to even\r\nset foot outside the village.[VAR 0114(0049)]
msg_area00_talk_06_01	You Survey Corps lot are amazing! I mean...you\ncatch all these strange Pokémon like it’s nothing![VAR 0114(0049)]
msg_area00_talk_06_02	People fear what they don’t know. But we might\nbe able to move on from that mindset if you\r\nkeep up those surveys of yours.[VAR 0114(0049)]
msg_area00_talk_06_03	I find myself wondering what sort of creatures\nPokémon really are...\c\nThey’re clearly far more dangerous than even\ntyphoons or earthquakes...[VAR 0114(0049)]
msg_area00_talk_06_04	Once we all start learning more about Pokémon\nfrom that Pokédex of yours, I think we’ll find\r\nthem much less frightening.[VAR 0114(0049)]
msg_area00_talk_06_05	Ouch, ouch, ouch! Well, I didn’t even stand\na chance...\c\nI should have heeded the warning in your\nPokédex and been a bit more careful.[VAR 0114(0049)]
msg_area00_talk_07	Back in my hometown, I’ve got an older brother\nwho’s gonna inherit the family farm an’ all.\r\nBut I’m gonna make my own way here in Hisui![VAR 0114(005F)]
msg_area00_talk_07_01	Folks come here to Hisui ’cause there’s no place\nfor ’em back home.[VAR 0114(005F)]
msg_area00_talk_07_02	Wow, you’re amazing! I want a partner\nPokémon, too![VAR 0114(005F)]
msg_area00_talk_07_03	You’ll get us outta this...won’t you...?[VAR 0114(005F)]
msg_area00_talk_07_04	All the shops ’n’ stuff in Jubilife are real nice\nnow! So I guess...time to build a new village?[VAR 0114(005F)]
msg_area00_talk_08	They say hunger is the best seasoning, but I’d\nrather rely on the quality of my Sootfoot Roots\r\nto make my potato mochi tasty.[VAR 0114(000E)]
msg_area00_talk_08_01	At what point does a stranger become one of us?\nI wonder where that boundary lies...[VAR 0114(000E)]
msg_area00_talk_08_02	I did what I came to do here in Hisui. Now I\nsuppose it’s time for me to head someplace\r\nwith a more agreeable climate.[VAR 0114(000E)]
msg_area00_talk_09	This region is huuuge! And there’s lotsa\ndangerous Pokémon, too! But you came here\r\nanyway... How come?[VAR 0114(0060)]
msg_area00_talk_09_01	Wooow, you caught Pokémon?![VAR 0114(0060)]
msg_area00_talk_09_02	What’s it like, battlin’ scary-strong Pokémon?[VAR 0114(0060)]
msg_area00_talk_09_03	What a weird sky...[VAR 0114(0060)]
msg_area00_talk_09_04	Hey, can anyone make friends with Pokémon\nif they have Poké Balls?[VAR 0114(0060)]
msg_area00_talk_70	If I can catch a partner Pokémon with the Poké\nBalls you gave me, it’ll help me become an\r\nawesome member of the Galaxy Team for sure![VAR 0114(0060)]
msg_area00_talk_10	Those Survey Corps people... What is it they’re\nactually investigating?\c\nAll they seem to do is eat potato mochi at\nthe Wallflower. Are they making some sort of\r\nPotato Dex or what?[VAR 0114(002F)]
msg_area00_talk_10_01	So you’re the new recruit from the Survey Corps?\nDon’t slack off on making that Pokédex of yours.[VAR 0114(002F)]
msg_area00_talk_10_02	Seems to me, someone of your strength would be\nfar better utilized in the Security Corps than in\r\nthe Survey Corps.[VAR 0114(002F)]
msg_area00_talk_10_03	This is the end... Even someone as strong as you\ncan’t stop a cataclysm like this, can you?[VAR 0114(002F)]
msg_area00_talk_10_04	I think I’ll ask Melli of the Diamond Clan to join\nme for a sparring session sometime.[VAR 0114(002F)]
msg_area00_talk_66	I’m glad we managed to prevent that Drifloon\nfrom causing any real trouble. Now we just need\r\nto post more guards out on Prelude Beach...[VAR 0114(002F)]
msg_area00_talk_11	Commander Kamado is fantastically strong!\c\nRumor has it he once sent a Pokémon flying\nwith one of those sumo throws he’s so proud of![VAR 0114(002A)]
msg_area00_talk_11_01	Looks like you got some skills, kid. Good thing,\ntoo—it’s dangerous outside the village![VAR 0114(002A)]
msg_area00_talk_11_02	The Pokémon nobles are seriously powerful\nPokémon that protect the Diamond and\r\nPearl Clans...\c\nIt’s incredible to think you’re even stronger than\nthey are![VAR 0114(002A)]
msg_area00_talk_11_03	Even Commander Kamado can’t win against a\nforce of nature...[VAR 0114(002A)]
msg_area00_talk_11_04	I hear some Galaxy folks plan to turn one of\nour base camps into a new village.[VAR 0114(002A)]
msg_area00_talk_59	My li’l buddy here will evolve into the best\nBeautifly there ever was. You’ll see![VAR 0114(002A)]
msg_area00_talk_60	The Silcoon look suits my buddy for sure.\nBut I can’t wait to see it as a Beautifly![VAR 0114(002A)]
msg_area00_talk_61	Haaah... Why would the professor say that?[VAR 0114(002A)]
msg_area00_talk_62	I love my buddy, no matter what it looks like!\nBut its nickname needs changing, I guess...\c\nTo rename one of your Pokémon, you just need\nto choose it from your party, right?[VAR 0114(002A)]
msg_area00_talk_12	Pokémon t-terrify me... Even going out to gather\nBerries is the worst...[VAR 0114(002C)]
msg_area00_talk_12_01	Hisui is positively bursting with Bidoof and lots\nof other Pokémon besides. It’s no exaggeration\r\nto say this land belongs to them, really.\c\nI just don’t think humans are ready to settle\nhere yet...[VAR 0114(002C)]
msg_area00_talk_12_02	Are you teaching your Pokémon new moves?\c\nMake sure to check how your party Pokémon are\ndoing as often as you can![VAR 0114(002C)]
msg_area00_talk_12_03	That terrifying being atop Mount Coronet... I get\nwhy people might see such a thing as a deity.[VAR 0114(002C)]
msg_area00_talk_12_04	I hear Captain Zisu wants to build a dojo to\nteach everyone how to battle with Pokémon![VAR 0114(002C)]
msg_area00_talk_64	Those pesky Bidoof gave me some valuable\ntraining. Now I’m really on the ball with my\r\nSecurity Corps duties![VAR 0114(002C)]
msg_area00_talk_13	It’s a brave new land we’re living in! Gotta learn\nmore about the Pokémon here![VAR 0114(0038)]
msg_area00_talk_13_01	It’s a brave new land we’re living in! Which means\nthere’s a whole lot to do...[VAR 0114(0038)]
msg_area00_talk_13_02	Maybe we could use the strange powers of\nPokémon to help our crops grow faster?[VAR 0114(0038)]
msg_area00_talk_13_04	I just want Paira and Waka to escape safely...\nI don’t think that’s too much for a father to ask.[VAR 0114(0038)]
msg_area00_talk_13_05	Humans and Pokémon living together...\nI can’t wait to see what the future has in store![VAR 0114(0038)]
msg_area00_talk_13_06	Hey, Survey Corps kid! Do you like Cherrim\nbetter when it’s budding or when it’s in bloom?\c\nI think both forms of Cherrim are great, myself.[VAR 0114(0038)]
msg_area00_talk_14	We Galaxy folks may be one big group now, but\nwe drifted here from all over the place—Kanto,\r\nJohto... You name it!\c\nThey should call us the Ragtag Expedition Team![VAR 0114(0033)]
msg_area00_talk_14_01	Pokémon are full of mysteries... I hope you can\nhelp us solve them.[VAR 0114(0033)]
msg_area00_talk_14_02	Partnering up with Pokémon is much better than\nfighting against them, don’t you think?[VAR 0114(0033)]
msg_area00_talk_14_03	It may well be impossible for humans to ever\ncompletely understand Pokémon...[VAR 0114(0033)]
msg_area00_talk_14_04	How does it feel to have caught a Pokémon\nrevered by some as a deity?[VAR 0114(0033)]
msg_area00_talk_14_05	Zubat’s the best Pokémon to have with you for\nguard duty, both during the day and at night![VAR 0114(0033)]
msg_area00_talk_15	All the new folks coming to Jubilife will need\nfeeding. I should get to collecting some honey![VAR 0114(0039)]
msg_area00_talk_15_01	You have [VAR 1101(00FD,0002)]a Pokémon with you...? Wow... And\n[VAR 1101(00FD,0707)]it doesthey don’t attack you?[VAR 0114(0039)]
msg_area00_talk_15_02	I get why Pokémon would want to attack us.\c\nFrom their point of view, we’re the intruders\nafter all...[VAR 0114(0039)]
msg_area00_talk_15_03	If we grew crops that Pokémon could eat,\nmaybe we could become friends with them?[VAR 0114(0039)]
msg_area00_talk_15_04	Some Pokémon are so sturdy, they’d be great for\nhelping us plow the fields![VAR 0114(0039)]
msg_area00_talk_15_05	Ever since I found out that each Combee swarm\nmakes a different flavor of honey, I can hardly\r\nwait to harvest my honey and find out how\r\nit tastes![VAR 0114(0039)]
msg_area00_talk_16	Galaxy Hall’s built in a modern style. We worked\nin design elements from the Galar region, too.[VAR 0114(001F)]
msg_area00_talk_16_01	Maybe we oughta build some spare lodgings in\ncase anyone else falls out of the sky.[VAR 0114(001F)]
msg_area00_talk_16_02	It’d sure be nice if we could gather materials in\npeace and have a safe home to come back to.[VAR 0114(001F)]
msg_area00_talk_16_03	All that matters right now is keeping our people\nalive. The village can be rebuilt.[VAR 0114(001F)]
msg_area00_talk_16_04	I’ve heard talk lately that we might start building\nnew villages while we keep expanding Jubilife.[VAR 0114(001F)]
msg_area00_talk_73	I don’t know which was the bigger shock—\nthat a Pichu had been in my house or that it\r\ncame just to say thank you!\c\nSeems some Pokémon have real decency.[VAR 0114(001F)]
msg_area00_bed_01	Rest until tomorrow morning?
msg_area00_talk_17	You won’t find any Pokémon on Prelude Beach.\nIt’s about as safe as things get around here.
msg_area00_talk_17_01	Here at the seaside gate, sure, it’s pretty safe.\nNo wild Pokémon round here, after all.[VAR 0114(0031)]
msg_area00_talk_17_02	Whenever I see Prelude Beach, it reminds me of\nthe day I first arrived in Hisui...[VAR 0114(0031)]
msg_area00_talk_17_03	It’s almost as if the very land of Hisui is rejecting\nus... But where else are we supposed to go?[VAR 0114(0031)]
msg_area00_talk_17_04	I’m sure glad you came here! Thanks to you,\nit seems Hisui has finally accepted us.[VAR 0114(0031)]
msg_area00_talk_18	They say the Pokémon of Hisui are even more\nsavage and powerful than those of other regions.[VAR 0114(0029)]
msg_area00_talk_18_01	If only I had a whole bunch of partner Pokémon...\nThen guard duty would be so much easier.[VAR 0114(0029)]
msg_area00_talk_18_02	Your partner Pokémon must be [VAR 1101(00FD,0E0F)]a solid fightersolid fighters if\nyou managed to quell a frenzied Pokémon noble.[VAR 0114(0029)]
msg_area00_talk_18_03	If Pokémon are what test our strength in Hisui,\nmaybe Pokémon will also be the ones to save us.[VAR 0114(0029)]
msg_area00_talk_18_04	Pokémon won’t ever disappear from the world,\nno matter how many you catch.\c\nThat means we’re always going to need people\nlike me to stand guard.[VAR 0114(0029)]
msg_area00_talk_63	They may be the same species, but the big and\nthe small Buizel seem totally different.[VAR 0114(0029)]
msg_area00_talk_19	As the village grows, it seems we can’t avoid\nattracting odd folks like you...[VAR 0114(003B)]
msg_area00_talk_19_01	What with new folks pouring in all the time, we\ngotta work to make Jubilife the best it can be.[VAR 0114(003B)]
msg_area00_talk_19_02	If Pokémon can sleep inside their balls, I guess\nthat means they’re more comfy than they look.[VAR 0114(003B)]
msg_area00_talk_19_03	Between the Starly that scamper away at the\ndrop of a hat and this Pokémon on top of\r\nMount Coronet...there’s really a crazy variety\r\nof Pokémon out there.[VAR 0114(003B)]
msg_area00_talk_19_04	I wonder if Jubilife will grow into a big ol’ city\none day?[VAR 0114(003B)]
msg_area00_talk_19_05	No matter what form he takes, Eevee is always\ncute when he stuffs his little cheeks with food.[VAR 0114(003B)]
msg_area00_talk_19_06	Thanks to those Jubilife Muffins, Eevee and I are\ncloser than ever. Living with a Pokémon can be\r\nquite a lot of fun![VAR 0114(003B)]
msg_area00_talk_20	Our human weapons are no match against the\nfangs and claws of Pokémon![VAR 0114(0034)]
msg_area00_talk_20_01	Throwing Poké Balls is all well and good.\nJust don’t throw away your life, kid![VAR 0114(0034)]
msg_area00_talk_20_02	To fight against Pokémon, we need to borrow\nthe strength of other Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0034)]
msg_area00_talk_20_03	Can the Pokémon on Mount Coronet really be\ncaught inside a Poké Ball?![VAR 0114(0034)]
msg_area00_talk_20_04	The more we know about Pokémon, the less we\nfear them...\c\nIt’s funny that we can form such a bond with them\nwhen they don’t understand human speech![VAR 0114(0034)]
msg_area00_talk_20_05	Thanks to you, Pachirisu and I are really in sync.\c\nEven Captain Zisu is full of praise for our battle\nskills these days![VAR 0114(0034)]
msg_area00_talk_21	The Snorlax that Commander Kamado keeps with\nhim is a huge Pokémon. And it’s always sleeping![VAR 0114(0064)]
msg_area00_talk_21_01	It’s rather impressive that you can get so close to\nPokémon while they’re firing attacks at you!\r\nOh, I bet you’re skilled at dodging![VAR 0114(0064)]
msg_area00_talk_21_02	Your accuracy in throwing Poké Balls exactly\nwhere you want is quite remarkable!\r\nI bet you make sure to focus before throwing![VAR 0114(0064)]
msg_area00_talk_21_03	*sigh*\nI suppose this is it for our world...[VAR 0114(0064)]
msg_area00_talk_21_04	Even if we caught all the Pokémon in Hisui, there\nwould still be plenty of Pokémon elsewhere in\r\nthe world, no?[VAR 0114(0064)]
msg_area00_talk_21_05	[~ 118]
msg_area00_talk_22	A new hairstyle means a fresh outlook. And a\nfresh outlook lets you change your fortunes![VAR 0114(005C)]
msg_area00_talk_22_01	New arrivals coming to live in the village, hm?\nIt’s probably high time I had myself an assistant...\r\nor rather, a successor.[VAR 0114(005C)]
msg_area00_talk_22_02	Hisui is done for... Right after I entrusted the\nsalon to young Arezu, too. What dreadful timing.[VAR 0114(005C)]
msg_area00_talk_22_03	It’s hard to care about things like your hairstyle\nwhen you’re struggling to survive.[VAR 0114(005C)]
msg_area00_talk_23	I came here from across the sea in search of\nfields to call my very own.\c\nFor this venture of mine to succeed, I need to\nmake sure we can work these fields safely.[VAR 0114(001E)]
msg_area00_talk_23_01	It’s tough picking Berries out in the wilds, so I’m\nhoping we can grow them here instead.[VAR 0114(001E)]
msg_area00_talk_23_02	Apparently even Pokémon have some flavors\nthey prefer over others. Though I suppose that’s\r\nprobably true for all living things.[VAR 0114(001E)]
msg_area00_talk_23_03	We’re in dire straits—no doubt about it—but...it’s\nalso thrilling to witness something so unusual![VAR 0114(001E)]
msg_area00_talk_23_04	It’s impossible to go against nature when you’re\nfarming. You simply have to deal with whatever\r\nnature throws at you![VAR 0114(001E)]
msg_area00_talk_24	If you’re gonna live here from now on, I suggest\nyou sign up with the Galaxy Team.[VAR 0114(003A)]
msg_area00_talk_24_01	Some Pokémon prefer rainy days, you know.\nMe, I just stay inside and enjoy a nice nap.[VAR 0114(003A)]
msg_area00_talk_24_02	Some Pokémon only come out at night, you\nknow. I’m always asleep in my quarters by then,\r\nbut to each their own![VAR 0114(003A)]
msg_area00_talk_24_03	What a frightening sky... I think I’ll head to my\nquarters and rest for now.[VAR 0114(003A)]
msg_area00_talk_24_04	I might’ve overdone it a bit at the festival...\nI’ll just go sleep it off in my quarters.[VAR 0114(003A)]
msg_area00_talk_25	We’re in the middle of nowhere out here.\nWe have to make what we need ourselves.[VAR 0114(0021)]
msg_area00_talk_25_01	If you’re short on items...craft more yourself!\c\nIf you want to craft new items...collect recipes![VAR 0114(0021)]
msg_area00_talk_25_02	The more widely you explore, the more materials\nyou’ll find...and thus, the more items you’ll be\r\nable to craft![VAR 0114(0021)]
msg_area00_talk_25_03	I’m afraid I can’t think of an item that would help\nus fix this sky.[VAR 0114(0021)]
msg_area00_talk_25_04	Seems we’ll have far more people choosing to\nshare their lives with Pokémon from now on.\c\nWhich means I’ll need to churn out plenty of\nPoké Balls![VAR 0114(0021)]
msg_area00_talk_26	If we want to guard the village properly, we’ll\nneed to partner up with Pokémon...[VAR 0114(0032)]
msg_area00_talk_26_01	If there’s a place you’re hoping to visit, you\nought to stretch out your map and put a pin in it.[VAR 0114(0032)]
msg_area00_talk_26_02	The more base camps we have, the easier it’ll be\nto reach even the most remote corners of Hisui![VAR 0114(0032)]
msg_area00_talk_26_03	Even you Survey Corps folks can’t find out what’s\ncausing this bizarre sky, can you?\r\nIt’s not something you can survey![VAR 0114(0032)]
msg_area00_talk_26_04	Professor Laventon sure goes to the base camps\na lot. He says it’s just for the sake of his research,\r\nbut it’s still amazing![VAR 0114(0032)]
msg_area00_talk_27	It’s safe here in Jubilife Village. Don’t forget\nyou can always return here to rest and recover.[VAR 0114(0020)]
msg_area00_talk_27_01	If you’ve been attacked by a Pokémon, you can\nalways go to a base camp to rest.[VAR 0114(0020)]
msg_area00_talk_27_02	It’s good to look out for your own health, but\nmake sure your Pokémon are fighting fit, too!\c\nIf not, you’ll all be in trouble if a wild\nPokémon attacks.[VAR 0114(0020)]
msg_area00_talk_27_03	I’m so worried, I can’t get a wink of sleep.\nWith this sky, you can’t even tell night from day.[VAR 0114(0020)]
msg_area00_talk_27_04	I wish the base camps had roofs. Then you would\nfeel even safer when visiting them![VAR 0114(0020)]
msg_area00_talk_28	So...this village of ours also attracts strange-\ngarbed folks like yerself, eh?[VAR 0114(0037)]
msg_area00_talk_28_01	Gotta expand these ’ere fields to help feed all\nthe new folks comin’ to the village.[VAR 0114(0037)]

msg_area00_talk_28_04	The sky might turn red again one day...but we’ll\ndeal with that when it happens![VAR 0114(0037)]
msg_area00_talk_28_05	Thanks to that Pokémon you lent us, the soil\nin these fields is soft ’n’ fluffy as a pillow!\r\nI reckon we can grow some fine crops ’ere now.[VAR 0114(0037)]
msg_area00_talk_28_06	Now even this fine expanse o’ fields has aaaaaall\nthe water it needs. Pokémon sure are amazin’![VAR 0114(0037)]
msg_area00_talk_28_07	Yer Pokémon’s helped us smash up the rocks\ninside the soil, too! Even long-rooted plants ain’t\r\ngonna be no problem now!\c\nIt’s all thanks to you that Pokémon are helpin’ the\nvillage like this. We owe ya one![VAR 0114(0037)]
msg_area00_talk_29	We’re running low on Potions... Guess I’ll need\nto go and gather more materials...[VAR 0114(0028)]
msg_area00_talk_29_01	You’re part of the Survey Corps now, right?\nYou should craft your own Potions.[VAR 0114(0028)]
msg_area00_talk_29_02	Make sure you always carry plenty of medicine\nto heal your Pokémon after battle.\c\nAfter all, you wouldn’t stand a chance against\nwild Pokémon on your own![VAR 0114(0028)]
msg_area00_talk_29_03	I don’t know what will become of the sky—or the\nwhole of Hisui for that matter—but I’ll continue\r\nto heal the sick, no matter what![VAR 0114(0028)]
msg_area00_talk_29_04	There would certainly be fewer casualties if\neveryone had a partner Pokémon with them.[VAR 0114(0028)]
msg_area00_talk_30	The captain of the Survey Corps, Cyllene...\nI wonder if anything actually scares her?[VAR 0114(003C)]
msg_area00_talk_30_01	It’s amazing that Captain Cyllene has\nacknowledged your potential.[VAR 0114(003C)]
msg_area00_talk_30_02	You’re researching the noble Pokémon, too?\nMy, being in the Survey Corps must be tough.[VAR 0114(003C)]
msg_area00_talk_30_03	I suppose even bizarre things like this happen to\nyou if you live long enough.[VAR 0114(003C)]
msg_area00_talk_30_04	For people and Pokémon alike, nothing is more\nimportant than health.[VAR 0114(003C)]
msg_area00_talk_31	I came here all the way from Hoenn... But this\nland has nothing in it![VAR 0114(003D)]
msg_area00_talk_31_01	I came here all the way from Hoenn... But this\nland is horrendous![VAR 0114(003D)]
msg_area00_talk_31_02	I came here all the way from Hoenn... It seems\nthis land is just getting interesting![VAR 0114(003D)]
msg_area00_talk_32	It may be a small thing, but it sure feels great to\nbe able to make what’s needed for the team![VAR 0114(003E)]
msg_area00_talk_32_01	A trusty satchel is a must if you want to gather\nlots of materials for crafting.\c\nYou should speak to Bagin—he’ll teach you how\nto pack even more into that satchel of yours![VAR 0114(003E)]
msg_area00_talk_32_02	You should try experimenting with different items\nif you’re going to catch Pokémon. I imagine\r\ncake-lures should work a treat![VAR 0114(003E)]
msg_area00_talk_32_03	I’ll just keep on making tools and hope things\nget back to normal soon enough...[VAR 0114(003E)]
msg_area00_talk_32_04	If Jubilife gets much bigger, we won’t be able to\ncraft items fast enough to keep up with demand...\c\nWe gotta think of a way to make items more\nefficiently somehow![VAR 0114(003E)]
msg_area00_talk_32_05	I can’t wait for the next full moon so I can go see\nthe Clefairy dance![VAR 0114(003E)]
msg_area00_talk_33	You can throw spoiled Apricorns at wild Pokémon\nto make them drop their defenses. Then they’ll\r\nbe easier to catch![VAR 0114(0026)]
msg_area00_talk_33_01	I hear the village pastures will take care of any\nPokémon you catch.[VAR 0114(0026)]
msg_area00_talk_33_02	You can buy new recipes for making items over at\nthe craftworks.[VAR 0114(0026)]
msg_area00_talk_33_03	This is just awful. I’m at a loss for words...[VAR 0114(0026)]
msg_area00_talk_33_04	Have you managed to get hold of all the crafting\nrecipes? I know about 40 of them, myself.[VAR 0114(0026)]
msg_area00_talk_68	Don’t you forget—Starly is the cutest little thing\nin the world! I’m just...too scared to touch it.[VAR 0114(0026)]
msg_area00_talk_34	Here at the craftworks, we sell materials and\nrecipes. Can I help you with something?[VAR 0114(0050)]
msg_area00_talk_35	See something you want? It’s yours, for a price.\nIf it’s not here, by all means, craft it yourself.[VAR 0114(001C)]
msg_area00_talk_36	I wonder if there’s anyone capable of catching\nenough Pokémon to fill all the pastures here...[VAR 0114(0053)]
msg_area00_talk_37	Whoa, there! It’s dangerous beyond these gates.\nYou should stay inside the village.
msg_area00_talk_37_01	Yeah, I heard. You passed your trial, right?\nNow go report to Captain Cyllene.[VAR 0114(0030)]
msg_area00_talk_37_02	Now that you’ve passed your trial, you should\nlearn how to craft items.[VAR 0114(0030)]
msg_area00_talk_37_03	Errr, isn’t Rei waiting for you over at the\ntraining grounds?[VAR 0114(0030)]

msg_area00_talk_999	Hello!
msg_area00_talk_41	The people of this world fear Pokémon. It is\nbeyond them to befriend Pokémon and have\r\nthem battle, I’m afraid.[VAR 0114(0015)]
msg_area00_talk_42	If you gather rare materials from far-flung places,\nyou’ll be able to craft all sorts of items![VAR 0114(0035)]
msg_area00_talk_42_01	As long as we have customers to serve, we’ll keep\non selling—end of the world or no![VAR 0114(0035)]
msg_area00_talk_42_02	If people and Pokémon start living together,\nI’m sure some people out there will see that as\r\na great new business opportunity![VAR 0114(0035)]
msg_area00_talk_42_03	I still can’t believe that journal melted into\nthin air like it was under a Pokémon’s spell!\c\nI like to think it’s now returned to where\nit belongs.[VAR 0114(0035)]
msg_area00_talk_43	Lemme get this straight... Outside the village\nthere’s terrifying Pokémon. And now inside the\r\nvillage there’s strange folk like you?[VAR 0114(0027)]
msg_area00_talk_43_01	Get Pokémon...to help with our manual work...?\nNo way, that’s crazy talk.[VAR 0114(0027)]
msg_area00_talk_43_02	Get Pokémon...to help with our work...?\nNow why didn’t I think of that![VAR 0114(0027)]
msg_area00_talk_43_03	It’s clear we’re not in charge here in Hisui.\nThis land belongs to Pokémon...[VAR 0114(0027)]
msg_area00_talk_43_04	We’re seein’ more and more Pokémon inside the\nvillage these days... Things have changed so\r\nquickly round here![VAR 0114(0027)]
msg_area00_talk_69	The markings on Shinx’s ears are different\nthan Luxio’s![VAR 0114(0027)]

msg_area00_talk_44_01	What? You came here to pass our entry trial?\nNo wonder I’d never seen you before![VAR 0114(0043)]
msg_area00_talk_44_02	If you’re attacked by Pokémon or fall off a\ntall ledge or cliff, you’ll black out for sure!\r\nBe careful out there![VAR 0114(0043)]
msg_area00_talk_44_03	I picked the wrong place to come and make a\nname for myself... I just want to go home.[VAR 0114(0043)]
msg_area00_talk_44_04	Andra, Beauregard, and I came to Hisui hoping\nto achieve great things out here. We’ll work hard\r\nto make our dream come true![VAR 0114(0043)]
msg_area00_talk_45	There’s always a need for labor here. It’s the\nperfect place to make myself useful!\c\nIt’s not like I was doing much back\nhome, anyway...[VAR 0114(0044)]
msg_area00_talk_45_01	Is there anything at all I can do to help...?[VAR 0114(0044)]
msg_area00_talk_45_02	If some Pokémon stole my pack and ate the\ncontents...I guess you could say I was useful\r\nto the Pokémon, right?[VAR 0114(0044)]
msg_area00_talk_45_03	I took on a buncha work to make myself useful to\nthe village...but in the end, all I could do was rely\r\non you. Thanks for saving all our hides.[VAR 0114(0044)]

msg_area00_talk_47_01	At the end of the day, Pokémon are wild\ncreatures. It’s normal for some to trust us and\r\nfor others to treat us as enemies.[VAR 0114(004B)]
msg_area00_talk_47_02	I wonder how the Diamond and Pearl Clans\nare feeling now?[VAR 0114(004B)]
msg_area00_talk_48	I left the store I had in Johto in the hands of\nmy son and his wife.
msg_area00_talk_49	To catch one of those Pokémon creatures, you\nneed to throw a Poké Ball at it![VAR 0114(005B)]

msg_area00_talk_50_03	I imagine we’re all troubled by precisely the same\nthing these days—that worrisome sky above us.\r\nWhat can we do about it?[VAR 0114(005E)]
msg_area00_talk_50_04	We may just be one small village, but lots of\npeople and Pokémon live together here now.[VAR 0114(005E)]
msg_area00_talk_51	We need to keep improving the village for all\nthe people who come here from far and wide![VAR 0114(0061)]
msg_area00_talk_51_01	If I’d known this was going to happen, I never\nwould have come to Hisui![VAR 0114(0061)]

msg_area00_talk_52_01	Beni never talks about his past, but I wish he\nwould tell me where he learned to cook...[VAR 0114(006E)]

msg_area00_talk_54_01	Won’t people from nearby regions come to\nhelp us?[VAR 0114(003F)]
msg_area00_talk_54_02	The more people that have partner Pokémon, the\nmore people that’ll make them battle. You’ll see![VAR 0114(003F)]
msg_area00_talk_54_03	I’m worried that Piplup might collapse again if I\nleave it alone. I’ll take good care of it back in\r\nthe village.[VAR 0114(003F)]

msg_area00_talk_56	I got myself apprenticed to the Supply Corps,\nbut going out there to collect materials...\c\nOooh, it leaves me scared half to death! How do\nfolks keep themselves safe from wild Pokémon?[VAR 0114(0041)]
msg_area00_talk_56_01	Time and space all getting wonky... How is such a\nthing even possible?![VAR 0114(0041)]
msg_area00_talk_56_02	I saw the most unbelievable things! Or maybe not\n“saw”... Maybe more like “experienced”?\c\nEither way, I’m thinking I’ve got to tell the world\nabout what happened to me.[VAR 0114(0041)]
msg_area00_talk_56_03	[~ 252]
msg_area00_talk_57	You know, we had people back in Kanto who\nalso were able to tame Pokémon. They knew\r\nwhat they were doing in battles, too.[VAR 0114(0042)]
msg_area00_talk_57_01	What in the world are Pokémon really?! How do\nyou explain this madness?![VAR 0114(0042)]
msg_area00_talk_57_02	Well, I guess there’s a good reason why legends\nbecome legends, if you follow me.[VAR 0114(0042)]
msg_area00_talk_57_03	The professor was nattering on to me about how\nPokémon evolve and then they look different...\c\nWhat about Burmy, though? They already look\ndifferent. What happens when they evolve?[VAR 0114(0042)]
msg_area00_talk_58	Abaaa.
msg_area00_talk_74	Mr. Mime taught me that not all wild Pokémon\nneed to be feared![VAR 0114(0045)]

msg_area00_talk_75_02	I’m the famous mushroom hunter Morel, and\nyou’d do well remember that—I’m a real fun guy![VAR 0114(002E)]
msg_area00_talk_75_03	The famous mushroom hunter Morel...is thinking\nabout mushrooms even at a time like this!\c\nAfter all, the world could end any minute now!\nI can’t let my last chance at mushrooms molder![VAR 0114(002E)]
msg_area00_talk_75_04	If I had a partner Pokémon of my own, I’d sure\nfeel a lot safer going out to pick mushrooms.[VAR 0114(002E)]
msg_area00_talk_75_05	Could it be that...the mushroom is what’s really\nin control...? N-no, surely not...[VAR 0114(002E)]
msg_area00_talk_75_06	Swinub’s got a real knack for rooting out some\nswell mushrooms, wouldn’t you say?\c\nI’d like to take one out for a bit of fungi-finding\nfun of my own one of these days...[VAR 0114(002E)]

msg_area00_talk_76	You...definitely have a suspicious look about you![VAR 0114(002D)]

msg_area00_talk_76_02	You fall right out of nowhere and start setting\nthings right when they’re falling apart...\r\nYou’re like the hero in some sort of play![VAR 0114(002D)]

msg_area00_talk_76_04	Waka’s been saying that he wants to join up\nwith the Galaxy Team once he’s old enough...\r\nIf that day comes, look after him, won’t you?[VAR 0114(002D)]
msg_area00_talk_67	Do you think people often mistake Pokémon for\nother things, like I did with that will-o’-the-wisp?[VAR 0114(002D)]
msg_area00_talk_77	You DO know about Commander Kamado, right?\nYou know, that he has no home to return to?[VAR 0114(004C)]
msg_area00_talk_77_01	We’ve angered the Pokémon. Now this village\nwill end up just like the commander’s hometown.\r\nBurned to ashes until nothing remains...[VAR 0114(004C)]
msg_area00_talk_77_02	If we don’t get along with the Pokémon around\nus, the sky might go all awful again like before...[VAR 0114(004C)]

msg_area00_talk_78	The more people gather, the more their dreams\nand discontent gather as well, filling a place...\c\nAnd among so many, surely some must carry\ngrievances against the Pokémon surrounding us.[VAR 0114(0065)]
msg_area00_talk_78_01	After seeing that otherworldly sky stretched\nabove us, can anyone still find it within them to\r\nfeel any love for the Pokémon that bedevil us?[VAR 0114(0065)]
msg_area00_talk_78_02	Pokémon are terribly frightening creatures...\nAnd yet...there are moments when I can look\r\nupon one and find something to love there.[VAR 0114(0065)]
msg_area00_talk_79	Oooh, I simply can’t help myself when it comes\nto Master Beni’s potato mochi! They’re the whole\r\nreason I came to live in Hisui![VAR 0114(004A)]
msg_area00_talk_79_01	D-do you think a Warding Charm will be enough\nto keep me safe from whatever this is?[VAR 0114(004A)]
msg_area00_talk_79_02	It’s always good to have a satchel chock-full of\ncharms when setting out on a survey![VAR 0114(004A)]
msg_area00_talk_79_03	[~ 283]
msg_area00_talk_80	I hear tell that there are unusually large\nspecimens of Pokémon called “alpha Pokémon.”\c\nI have absolutely no interest in meeting such a\nmonstrous specimen. If I came across one,\r\nI would turn heel and run for all I was worth![VAR 0114(0063)]
msg_area00_talk_80_01	What is the world coming to? This unnatural sky...\nWho knew there were yet worse things to fear\r\nthan those dreaded alpha Pokémon...[VAR 0114(0063)]
msg_area00_talk_80_02	If only I could meet the kind of Pokémon I dream\nof... The kind that isn’t terrifically frightening...[VAR 0114(0063)]
msg_area00_talk_80_03	I certainly didn’t realize that Pokémon’s tails\ncame in so many different varieties.\c\nIt was quite diverting to see all the different\nforms they take and how they move![VAR 0114(0063)]
msg_area00_talk_81	Can I level with you? I didn’t so much “choose to\ncome here” as I “chose to leave where I was.”\c\nI was in a bit of hot water back home, y’see.\nBut boy, did I ever get the wrong end of the stick.\c\nWhat kind of place is Hisui to run away to? Can’t\nrun anywhere with all these wild Pokémon about.[VAR 0114(004E)]
msg_area00_talk_81_01	This is a real sign, all right. My sins being visited\nback upon me.\c\nThat’s it. If we make it through this, I’ll become\na new man, I swear—start fresh, be good, all that.[VAR 0114(004E)]
msg_area00_talk_81_02	Once this hubbub’s all settled, I’m headed home\nto face the music. Time to do right by those folks\r\nI wronged...\c\nCan’t believe I thought I could steal someone\nelse’s lunch and simply get away with it![VAR 0114(004E)]
msg_area00_talk_81_03	So those little ’uns come in different cloaks, but\nthey’re Burmy just the same.\c\nGuess that’s not too different from us Galaxy\nTeam folk, all coming from different places.[VAR 0114(004E)]
msg_area00_talk_82	Nothing fazes me—I’m the cool, collected type.\nI came to see if Hisui’s as dangerous as they say.[VAR 0114(0052)]
msg_area00_talk_82_01	Nothing fazes me... I’m the cool, collected type...\nBut aaagh, that creepy sky is too much!\r\nI can’t bear it![VAR 0114(0052)]
msg_area00_talk_82_02	Well, I survived that creepy sky, so...NOW I can\nsay nothing’ll ever faze me![VAR 0114(0052)]
msg_area00_talk_82_03	This ought to help poor little Conlan get over his\nfear of ghosts! I feel much better...er, knowing\r\nhe’ll be better.[VAR 0114(0052)]
msg_area00_talk_83	I’m worried about the state of things here in\nJubilife Village. We lack basic necessities, and\r\nthere are some strange people around...[VAR 0114(0054)]
msg_area00_talk_83_01	You’re the new Survey Corps recruit, are you?\nWell, good luck with it all.[VAR 0114(0054)]
msg_area00_talk_83_02	Seems the Survey Corps struck gold when they\nfound you. Keep studying those Pokémon![VAR 0114(0054)]
msg_area00_talk_83_03	You’re going to...“investigate” what’s happening?\nI hope that means you’ll actually SOLVE it...[VAR 0114(0054)]
msg_area00_talk_83_04	I suppose the more you study, the more\nyou’ll discover.[VAR 0114(0054)]
msg_area00_talk_83_05	Ahhh, I love the herbs that Tangela gave me!\c\nTheir smell’s lovely and cool—like taking a\ndeep breath in the middle of a thick forest.\r\nBrings back fond memories of home...[VAR 0114(0054)]
msg_area00_talk_84	Strange places aren’t so bad if you’ve got family\naround, but you... Is there nobody here that\r\nyou know?[VAR 0114(0055)]
msg_area00_talk_84_01	I only lately found a home here, too. Glad to\nhave you.[VAR 0114(0055)]
msg_area00_talk_84_02	Doing nothing but work will wear a body and\nsoul right down.\c\nWe may be far from civilization, but we ought to\nat least have some music around here![VAR 0114(0055)]
msg_area00_talk_84_03	I hear the woman who sells charms is doing\ngreat business now...[VAR 0114(0055)]
msg_area00_talk_84_04	I wonder how Hisui will change as we people and\nPokémon intermingle...[VAR 0114(0055)]
msg_area00_talk_71	Self-sufficiency’s the word in Jubilife Village!\nWhat we lack, we can only make for ourselves.[VAR 0114(0055)]
msg_area00_talk_85	Just what kind of Pokémon is this “almighty\nSinnoh,” I wonder?[VAR 0114(002B)]
msg_area00_talk_85_01	No matter the circumstance, you can’t be at your\nbest if you don’t eat! That’s why there’s always\r\ntime to cook.[VAR 0114(002B)]
msg_area00_talk_85_02	There are so many ingredients to be found here\nin Hisui that’d be rare elsewhere![VAR 0114(002B)]
msg_area00_talk_85_03	You’ve been a tremendous help. Geodude will be\na boon for these pickles![VAR 0114(002B)]
msg_area00_talk_85_04	Oh, the dishes I might make with Octillery’s ink...\nMy creative spirit is ablaze![VAR 0114(002B)]
msg_area00_talk_85_05	Geodude’s Evolution seems to have caused my\npickle recipe to evolve as well![VAR 0114(002B)]
msg_area00_talk_86	Word of the Galaxy Team’s Survey Corps is\nstarting to trickle out to some far-off places.[VAR 0114(0066)]
msg_area00_talk_86_01	Whenever I see the sky, I can’t help but heave a\nlittle sigh.[VAR 0114(0066)]
msg_area00_talk_86_02	I’m trying to wipe away the memory of those\nfrightful times by going about my days normally.[VAR 0114(0066)]
msg_area00_talk_86_03	Each of those Burmy certainly did have character.\c\nI suspect you might find other Pokémon species\nthat come in different forms, if you look...[VAR 0114(0066)]
msg_area00_talk_87	Mercy, what a treasure this wide-open land is.\c\nI’m glad I followed my family out here and got to\nsee it. I doubt it’ll stay quiet and empty for long.[VAR 0114(0068)]
msg_area00_talk_87_01	I tell you, the view outside is extraordinary. Like\nsomething a master would paint.[VAR 0114(0068)]
msg_area00_talk_87_02	That strangeness in the sky helped bring the two\nclans and the Galaxy Team closer together.\r\nEvery cloud, as they say...[VAR 0114(0068)]
msg_area00_talk_88	Pretty odd getup, stranger. What’re you doing in\nJubilife Village, anyway?[VAR 0114(0067)]
msg_area00_talk_88_01	Listen, kid. If a wild Pokémon comes at you,\ndo two things: dodge it, and get outta there![VAR 0114(0067)]
msg_area00_talk_88_02	Pokémon can be stronger than you or I’ll ever be.\nThat’s why we deal with ’em using smarts...\r\nand tools![VAR 0114(0067)]
msg_area00_talk_88_03	This all goes to show that we’re powerless next to\nPokémon, in the end. Were from the start, even.[VAR 0114(0067)]
msg_area00_talk_88_04	That kid Lian from the Pearl Clan was saying\nthere might be coal to be found around here.[VAR 0114(0067)]
msg_area00_talk_89	I lost my home in a Pokémon attack. But then\nCommander Kamado kindly invited me to\r\ncome here.[VAR 0114(0058)]
msg_area00_talk_89_01	The Pokémon must be angry... What could be\nangering it?[VAR 0114(0058)]
msg_area00_talk_89_02	I hope to never again see people and Pokémon\npitted against one another.[VAR 0114(0058)]
msg_area00_talk_89_03	I’m glad I found it in myself to keep Chimecho\naround. It was all thanks to your help.[VAR 0114(0058)]
msg_area00_talk_90	I bet if I learn a lot about Pokémon, I can figure\nout the mysteries of the old tales, too![VAR 0114(006A)]
msg_area00_talk_90_01	The sky’s all red! Is this some mysterious\nPokémon thing?[VAR 0114(006A)]
msg_area00_talk_90_02	Dialga and Palkia are, um...“deities,” right?[VAR 0114(006A)]
msg_area00_talk_91	I’m scared of Pokémon... I wish I’d never been\nbrought here...[VAR 0114(006C)]
msg_area00_talk_91_01	You’re not scared of Pokémon?[VAR 0114(006C)]
msg_area00_talk_91_02	Hey, how do you get a Pokémon to be\nyour friend?[VAR 0114(006C)]
msg_area00_talk_91_03	The sky’s awful! It’s so scary![VAR 0114(006C)]
msg_area00_talk_91_04	I was playing with some of the Pokémon in the\nvillage earlier![VAR 0114(006C)]
msg_area00_talk_92	Hey, if you’re with Pokémon ever since you’re\nreally little, will they be your friend?[VAR 0114(006D)]
msg_area00_talk_92_01	What made that hole in the sky?[VAR 0114(006D)]
msg_area00_talk_92_02	Where do Pokémon come from?[VAR 0114(006D)]
msg_area00_talk_93	Bwaaah!!![VAR 0114(0069)]
msg_area00_talk_93_01	Hey, is it morning or night? Tell meee![VAR 0114(0069)]
msg_area00_talk_93_02	Hey, how come Pokémon are so weird?[VAR 0114(0069)]
msg_area00_talk_93_03	Hey, you know Magikarp? They jump! A lot![VAR 0114(0069)]
msg_area00_talk_94	Gonna play with Pokémooon![VAR 0114(006B)]
msg_area00_talk_94_01	You better stay at home! Outside isn’t safe![VAR 0114(006B)]
msg_area00_talk_94_02	When can I go play outside the walls?[VAR 0114(006B)]
msg_area00_talk_95	I’ve never seen clothes quite like yours, hon.\nWhere might they be from?[VAR 0114(001D)]
msg_area00_talk_96	Hm. Worrisome.[VAR 0114(0091)]
msg_area00_talk_96_01	You’re the new Survey Corps recruit? Hm.\nGood luck. Pull your weight.[VAR 0114(0091)]
msg_area00_talk_96_02	I see you can get a job done. I hope we can\ncount on you to keep us safe.[VAR 0114(0091)]
msg_area00_talk_96_03	There’s so much to be worried about that I’ve\nbasically given up worrying.[VAR 0114(0091)]
msg_area00_talk_96_04	I see now why folks call the Survey Corps the\nPokémon problem solvers.[VAR 0114(0091)]
msg_area00_talk_96_05	Wanda can be...careless. I’m a little worried\nabout whether she’s up to working with the\r\nSecurity Corps.[VAR 0114(0091)]
msg_area00_talk_96_06	Thank you for finding Wanda again! I wish I were\nstrong enough to face Pokémon like you do.[VAR 0114(0091)]
msg_area00_talk_96_07	Wanda really looks up to you now! She talks\nabout you glowingly.\c\nAs her brother and supposed role model,\nI have...mixed feelings. But good for you![VAR 0114(0091)]
msg_area00_talk_96_08	You and Ursaluna have come to the rescue again.\c\nI can’t thank you enough for getting Wanda\nback—she’s my one and only sister.[VAR 0114(0091)]
msg_area00_talk_96_09	Apparently, Wanda’s going to stick to guard duty\nhere in the village for a while.\c\nI can’t tell you how much I appreciate you going\nto all those lengths to save her.[VAR 0114(0091)]
msg_area00_talk_97	We in the Security Corps certainly do patrol all\nover the place![VAR 0114(0070)]
msg_area00_talk_97_01	When you need to stand up to a Pokémon,\nI suppose you bring another Pokémon! Right?[VAR 0114(0070)]
msg_area00_talk_97_02	I wonder if there’s a Pokémon that could help me\nfind my way when I get lost.\c\nSomething like Captain Cyllene’s Abra, perhaps?[VAR 0114(0070)]
msg_area00_talk_98	I guess Pokémon must get friendly with people\nbecause they really want to.\c\nIf they didn’t, they’d probably just escape the\npastures and run.[VAR 0114(0071)]
msg_area00_talk_98_01	We’d never be able to conquer Pokémon.\nOur only hope is to become friendlier with them![VAR 0114(0071)]
msg_area00_talk_98_02	I guess Pokémon must get friendly with people\nbecause they really want to.\c\nIf they didn’t, they’d probably just escape the\npastures and run.[VAR 0114(0071)]
msg_area00_talk_98_03	Those Pokémon with two tail fins are so beautiful!\nI wonder if any of them would come live in the\r\nMilkiwa River...[VAR 0114(0071)]
msg_area00_talk_99	If we’re short on labor, maybe we can ask some\nPokémon to lend a hand...[VAR 0114(0097)]
msg_area00_talk_99_01	Just what kind of power lies hidden in Pokémon?[VAR 0114(0097)]
msg_area00_talk_99_02	Am I right that there’s a Pokémon called Bonsly?\nI feel an urge to get to know one.[VAR 0114(0097)]
msg_area00_talk_99_03	Machoke’s been great to work with.\c\nHaving help from Pokémon could open up a\nworld of building possibilities for the village.[VAR 0114(0097)]
msg_area00_talk_100	I was invited here to join the Security Corps.[VAR 0114(00DB)]
msg_area00_talk_100_04	When Pokémon react to you by attacking,\nare you making sure to dodge their moves?[VAR 0114(00DB)]
msg_area00_talk_100_05	When you face a strong Pokémon, focusing on it\nis vital![VAR 0114(00DB)]
msg_area00_talk_100_01	The villagers are ill at ease. Please hurry and\ninvestigate what’s happening![VAR 0114(00DB)]
msg_area00_talk_100_02	Showing people that Pokémon can be our helpful\npartners is one of my duties.[VAR 0114(00DB)]
msg_area00_talk_100_03	[~ 375]
msg_area00_talk_101	I’ll do my utmost to be of use to the\nSecurity Corps![VAR 0114(00DA)]
msg_area00_talk_101_04	When you encounter a wild Pokémon, the first\nthing you should do is focus on it.[VAR 0114(00DA)]
msg_area00_talk_101_05	Approaching Pokémon from behind is a useful\ntactic. It works on the stronger ones, too.[VAR 0114(00DA)]
msg_area00_talk_101_01	I want to do my utmost to help as a member of\nthe Security Corps, but...what should I do?[VAR 0114(00DA)]
msg_area00_talk_101_02	I believe having Pokémon battle one another\ncould open many possibilities![VAR 0114(00DA)]
msg_area00_talk_101_03	[~ 381]
msg_area00_talk_102	Do Pokémon fight among themselves? Or are\nthey more inclined to help each other?[VAR 0114(0099)]
msg_area00_talk_102_01	Can a Pokémon that can do this to the sky really\nbe caught with a ball?[VAR 0114(0099)]
msg_area00_talk_102_02	If we can figure out how the Origin Ball works, do\nyou think we might be able to create a perfect\r\nPoké Ball that could catch any Pokémon?[VAR 0114(0099)]
msg_area00_talk_102_03	Don’t you think Blissey resembles Pesselle?\nThey both help anyone in need, and then\r\nthere’s that particular shade of pink...[VAR 0114(0099)]
msg_area00_talk_103	Up on the third floor is the office of the Galaxy\nTeam’s commander, Kamado.\r\nYou’re not going up there until we know a little\r\nmore about you, mystery kid.[VAR 0114(009D)]
msg_area00_talk_103_01	Commander Kamado’s office is on the third floor.\nKeep up the good work, new kid![VAR 0114(009D)]
msg_area00_talk_104	I’m Rye. I’m an Agriculture Corps member, and\nyes, it is a bit odd that I would be working here.[VAR 0114(009F)]
msg_area00_talk_104_01	You can handle this. I don’t know how I know\nthat, but I know it.[VAR 0114(009F)]
msg_area00_talk_104_02	I’ll be training with Lucario, then.[VAR 0114(009F)]
msg_area00_talk_105	Alola![VAR 0114(009B)]
msg_area00_talk_105_01	What could cause Pokémon to fly into a frenzy?[VAR 0114(009B)]
msg_area00_talk_105_02	Just what could be on the other side of the\nspace-time rift?[VAR 0114(009B)]
msg_area00_talk_105_03	The Alabaster Icelands remind me of\nMount Lanakila.[VAR 0114(009B)]
msg_area00_talk_106	Are you gonna join the Security Corps, too?[VAR 0114(0085)]
msg_area00_talk_106_01	So you’re the Survey Corps’ newest member!\nLet’s both do our best for the sake of the village.[VAR 0114(0085)]
msg_area00_talk_106_02	I heard about how strong you are. Sure you\nwouldn’t be better off in the Security Corps?[VAR 0114(0085)]
msg_area00_talk_106_03	Our captain’s no match for the Pokémon atop\nMount Coronet, and neither is the commander.[VAR 0114(0085)]
msg_area00_talk_106_04	I feel as if the Security Corps’ row of quarters is\nstarting to look a little...rustic.[VAR 0114(0085)]
msg_area00_talk_107	Yes? Can I help you? If you need something,\nI suggest you try asking at headquarters.[VAR 0114(008F)]
msg_area00_talk_107_01	You’ve passed your trial, I hear?\c\nGoodness! Are you going to start catching all\nkinds of Pokémon now?[VAR 0114(008F)]
msg_area00_talk_107_02	I’ve heard that Pokémon called nobles are\nflying into frenzies all over Hisui...[VAR 0114(008F)]
msg_area00_talk_107_03	I know I’m part of the Security Corps, but I’m so\nfrightened I’ve just been quaking in my quarters...[VAR 0114(008F)]
msg_area00_talk_107_04	It’s not that I never leave my quarters—you just\nonly see me when I’m off duty.[VAR 0114(008F)]
msg_area00_talk_108	Um, these are Construction Corps quarters.[VAR 0114(008C)]
msg_area00_talk_108_01	Hello there, new Survey Corps recruit. Pleased to\ncount you as a teammate.[VAR 0114(008C)]
msg_area00_talk_108_02	Hello there, new Survey Corps recruit. I hear\nyou’ve proven yourself immensely capable.[VAR 0114(008C)]
msg_area00_talk_108_03	Hello, new— Pardon me. I mean seasoned and\nskilled Survey Corps member. The fate of the\r\nvillage is in your hands now.[VAR 0114(008C)]
msg_area00_talk_108_04	I’ve been pondering lately whether any Pokémon\nmoves could be of help with construction work.[VAR 0114(008C)]
msg_area00_talk_109	You’re a newcomer, right?\c\nIf you have to go out and get close to Pokémon,\nyou’d better do it stealthily.[VAR 0114(0075)]
msg_area00_talk_109_01	Aha—you’re with the Survey Corps now, if I’m\nnot mistaken? Let me offer you a tip.\c\nIf you’re out gathering materials, be sure to make\ngood use of your Crafting Kit.[VAR 0114(0075)]
msg_area00_talk_109_02	I suppose the Supply Corps ought to change how\nwe do things so people don’t put themselves in\r\nharm’s way gathering materials.[VAR 0114(0075)]
msg_area00_talk_110	You wouldn’t happen to be here to join the\nSupply Corps, would you?[VAR 0114(008B)]
msg_area00_talk_110_01	Welcome to the team. My grandpa Tao Hua is in\ncharge of the Supply Corps. Perhaps you’ll work\r\ntogether at some point.[VAR 0114(008B)]
msg_area00_talk_110_02	Make sure you’ve got the items you need when\nyou’re out to research a strong Pokémon.[VAR 0114(008B)]
msg_area00_talk_110_03	We’ve got to get back to our normal lives!\c\nAnd that means we’ll need Grandpa to keep on\ncrafting lots of items.[VAR 0114(008B)]
msg_area00_talk_110_04	I’d like to expand our shop to keep pace with\nhow Jubilife Village is growing.[VAR 0114(008B)]
msg_area00_talk_111	I tell you, there’s nothing like a Berry![VAR 0114(0096)]
msg_area00_talk_111_01	If you spot a Berry tree, have your Pokémon go\ngather some Berries from it![VAR 0114(0096)]
msg_area00_talk_111_02	Those balms were made from the noble’s favorite\nfoods, right? Their fragrance seemed to hold\r\nsome mysterious power...[VAR 0114(0096)]
msg_area00_talk_111_03	Now, I’ll sing Berries’ praises all day, but...I have\na feeling that the Pokémon atop Mount Coronet\r\nwon’t likely be tempted by ’em.[VAR 0114(0096)]
msg_area00_talk_111_04	I bet there are even more types of Berries out in\nthis great wide world...and I’d like to gather them\r\nall here in Hisui![VAR 0114(0096)]
msg_area00_talk_112	Don’t tell me you’ve been wandering around in\nthose flimsy clothes. You might want to stay here\r\nin the village, or else you could get hurt...[VAR 0114(00A0)]
msg_area00_talk_112_01	So you’ve joined the Survey Corps! Don’t forget\nto carry some Berries and Potions with you.[VAR 0114(00A0)]
msg_area00_talk_112_02	Make sure to show the Pokémon who’ve fought\nalongside you that you appreciate them.[VAR 0114(00A0)]
msg_area00_talk_112_03	I’ll give my own life to save lives, if it comes to\nthat...but I hope nobody heading up Mount\r\nCoronet will need such care in the first place.[VAR 0114(00A0)]
msg_area00_talk_112_04	Wouldn’t things feel safer if there were places all\nover where you could go for medical care?[VAR 0114(00A0)]
msg_area00_talk_113	You might do well to talk to lots of folks. See\nwhat you can learn.[VAR 0114(00A1)]
msg_area00_talk_113_01	Good luck, new recruit. Show us what you’re\nmade of.[VAR 0114(00A1)]
msg_area00_talk_113_02	Are you all right? And is Kleavor? I hope you’re\nnot getting involved with risky survey work...[VAR 0114(00A1)]
msg_area00_talk_113_03	I suppose sometimes there’s risky survey work\nyou just have to do.[VAR 0114(00A1)]
msg_area00_talk_113_04	You may be able to heal your Pokémon with a\nPotion anytime, but all the same, don’t push\r\nthem too far.[VAR 0114(00A1)]
msg_area00_talk_114	We’ve got to do more surveying to learn about\nthe areas all around Jubilife Village.[VAR 0114(0088)]
msg_area00_talk_114_01	So you’re with the Survey Corps now. What d’you\nthink of our base camps? Handy, aren’t they?[VAR 0114(0088)]
msg_area00_talk_114_02	We’ve got to scout out more locations where we\ncan build base camps.[VAR 0114(0088)]
msg_area00_talk_114_03	I never thought the Summit Camp up on Mount\nCoronet would become our frontline base in an\r\nemergency like this.[VAR 0114(0088)]
msg_area00_talk_114_04	I’ve been venturing out all over Hisui, and there\nreally are some odd Pokémon out there.[VAR 0114(0088)]
msg_area00_talk_115	I heard you caught some Pokémon—is it true?\nOh, uh, not that I want to see them out of their\r\nPoké Balls or anything. I’ll take your word for it.[VAR 0114(0086)]
msg_area00_talk_115_01	You’re going to survey Pokémon, huh? Going to\nfind out all the ways they’re terrifying?[VAR 0114(0086)]
msg_area00_talk_115_02	Battling with Pokémon?! That’s the most terrifying\nidea I’ve ever heard![VAR 0114(0086)]
msg_area00_talk_115_03	This whole calamity’s got to be the work of some\nPokémon, right?[VAR 0114(0086)]
msg_area00_talk_115_04	Will we all end up walking around with Pokémon\nat our sides eventually? I just...can’t quite picture\r\nthat happening.[VAR 0114(0086)]
msg_area00_talk_116	You must be plenty cold in those flimsy clothes.\c\nI mean, I can understand kids not letting a little\ncold stop them from playing outside...but you\r\nlook a fair bit older than that.[VAR 0114(008A)]
msg_area00_talk_116_01	Passed your trial, have you?\c\nI’m impressed you can approach Pokémon. I’d\njust turn and run from those scary beasts.[VAR 0114(008A)]
msg_area00_talk_116_02	You Survey Corps folks are doing amazing work.\c\nFolks around the village have all been reading\nstuff from that Pokédex lately.[VAR 0114(008A)]
msg_area00_talk_116_03	I hope those folks out in the Pearl Settlement are\ndoing all right...[VAR 0114(008A)]
msg_area00_talk_116_04	Setting up a base camp is hard work, you know.\c\nWe put in a lot of effort choosing places where it\nwon’t destroy Pokémon’s habitats if we build.[VAR 0114(008A)]
msg_area00_talk_117	Hey, um, where’d you come from? Your clothes\nlook kinda weird.[VAR 0114(004D)]

msg_area05_talk_11_01	One good thing about the red sky is that we\ndon’t need to worry about sunburn anymore![VAR 0114(00C7)]
msg_area05_talk_11_02	Snow goggles protect your eyes from the light\nreflected off the snow![VAR 0114(00C7)]
msg_area05_talk_12	I remember a girl with a Croagunk... She said\n“All the Pearl Clan does is sit around and\r\nwatch over boring old places!”\r\nand then she ran off into the wilds.\c\nI wonder what she’s doing now?[VAR 0114(00C9)]
msg_area05_talk_12_01	Nowhere in Hisui is safe now... We’re all done for.\nCompletely doomed...[VAR 0114(00C9)]
msg_area05_talk_12_02	That girl Coin from the Miss Fortune sisters...\nI guess she just has her own unique way of trying\r\nto find where she belongs.[VAR 0114(00C9)]
msg_area05_talk_13	Irida was so young when her mother left us, the\npoor girl can’t even recall her mother’s face.\r\nPerhaps that’s why she adores Palina so much.[VAR 0114(00CA)]
msg_area05_talk_13_01	I know this isn’t really the time for idle\nobservations, but don’t you think that Irida\r\nhas a commanding presence?[VAR 0114(00CA)]
msg_area05_talk_13_02	I’m glad Irida is our clan leader. Without her\nguidance, we would never have joined forces\r\nwith you or the Diamond Clan to challenge the\r\npower of almighty Sinnoh![VAR 0114(00CA)]
msg_area05_talk_14	With love in your heart for almighty Sinnoh and\nwith your dear ones close at hand, you can live\r\njust about anywhere.\c\nThis is one of the Pearl Clan’s teachings.[VAR 0114(00CB)]
msg_area05_talk_14_01	My love for almighty Sinnoh... Everything I’ve\nbelieved until now...[VAR 0114(00CB)]
msg_area05_talk_14_02	Perhaps the time has come for the Pearl Clan to\nchange as well.[VAR 0114(00CB)]
msg_area05_talk_15	If you hug one of those icy-looking Pokémon,\nyou can feel they’re actually a little warm!\c\nDo you think that’s because they have blood\nrunning in their bodies?[VAR 0114(00CD)]
msg_area05_talk_15_01	So...almighty Sinnoh is a Pokémon...\nJust like...the Pokémon in our settlement?[VAR 0114(00CD)]
msg_area05_talk_15_02	How should people deal with Pokémon in a\nworld that’s said to have been created by none\r\nother than a Pokémon?[VAR 0114(00CD)]
msg_area05_talk_16	Irida is serious to a fault, but, well...she was\nchosen as our clan leader very young, after all.\c\nI think it would have been fine to entrust Palina\nwith that role for a little while.[VAR 0114(00CE)]
msg_area05_talk_16_01	I’d feared that this whole mess would be too\nmuch for even Irida to handle, but...she’s been\r\ndealing with it surprisingly well![VAR 0114(00CE)]
msg_area05_talk_16_02	I wonder if Irida’s horizons have broadened after\nmeeting you and that Adaman lad from the\r\nDiamond Clan.[VAR 0114(00CE)]
msg_area05_talk_17	It’s a real pain getting hold of materials here in\nthe icelands. We have to buy almost everything\r\nfrom the Ginkgo Guild.[VAR 0114(00D0)]
msg_area05_talk_17_01	Surely the Ginkgo Guild has some sort of super\ngadget they can sell us to help in times like this?[VAR 0114(00D0)]
msg_area05_talk_17_02	I wonder what Volo from the Ginkgo Guild is up\nto these days?[VAR 0114(00D0)]
msg_area05_talk_18	It would sure feel a lot cheerier around here if\nnot for our ongoing feud with the Diamond Clan.[VAR 0114(00D1)]
msg_area05_talk_18_01	It’s not just our settlement at risk here. At this\nrate, all of Hisui will be lost...[VAR 0114(00D1)]
msg_area05_talk_18_02	We’ll protect our homes with our own power.\nIf we have Pokémon by our side, all the better.[VAR 0114(00D1)]
msg_area05_talk_19	If only the founders of our clan had met almighty\nSinnoh somewhere a bit more safe or warm...\r\nI’m sure many of us could have lived longer.[VAR 0114(00D3)]
msg_area05_talk_19_01	Is this really how you want to go about meeting\nalmighty Sinnoh?[VAR 0114(00D3)]
msg_area05_talk_19_02	I wonder if there was some deep meaning as to\nwhy our ancestors met almighty Sinnoh here.[VAR 0114(00D3)]
msg_area05_talk_20	Young Irida started training to become the\nclan leader when she was barely out of infancy.\r\nShe’s never had anyone her age to play with.[VAR 0114(00D5)]
msg_area05_talk_20_01	Why would almighty Sinnoh do this to us after\nwe revered and respected it so...?[VAR 0114(00D5)]
msg_area05_talk_20_02	It’s true Irida never had playmates, but she\nalways had Glaceon by her side.[VAR 0114(00D5)]
msg_area05_talk_21	Even we in the Pearl Clan might start moving to\nnew areas if our clan gets bigger![VAR 0114(00D7)]
msg_area05_talk_21_01	I’m all good. I got everything sorted for if we\nneed to run.[VAR 0114(00D7)]
msg_area05_talk_21_02	The potato mochi from the festival were\nsuper tasty![VAR 0114(00D7)]
msg_area05_talk_22	I heard there’s a place called the “world’s end.”\nWhere is that?[VAR 0114(00D9)]
msg_area05_talk_22_01	Is the world gonna end?[VAR 0114(00D9)]
msg_area05_talk_22_02	I’m gonna go look for the world’s end together\nwith my Pokémon![VAR 0114(00D9)]
msg_area05_talk_23	They say almighty Sinnoh watches over us from\nsomewhere beyond the skies.[VAR 0114(00DD)]
msg_area05_talk_23_01	A Pokémon like that was living on the other side\nof the space-time rift this whole time?[VAR 0114(00DD)]
msg_area05_talk_23_02	So almighty Sin— err...I mean Palkia and Dialga\nweren’t the Pokémon that created Hisui after all.[VAR 0114(00DD)]
msg_area05_talk_24	Almighty Sinnoh created the world.\nSpace was then born from that creation.[VAR 0114(00DE)]
msg_area05_talk_24_01	A deep red sky... Such is the power of the\nPokémon that birthed the world, I suppose.\c\nThough this is hardly the time to be impressed.[VAR 0114(00DE)]
msg_area05_talk_24_02	So time and space were controlled by two\ndifferent Pokémon...[VAR 0114(00DE)]
msg_area05_talk_25	Chop!
msg_area05_talk_26	Plink!
msg_area05_talk_27	Graaaaaa!

msg_ns_rematch_02_talk_01	The Lady of the Ridge is doing radiantly well.[VAR 0114(0011)]
msg_ns_rematch_02_talk_02	So, child, what do you want to do?[VAR 0114(0011)]
msg_ns_rematch_02_talk_03	Well, feel free to drop by again if you please.[VAR 0114(0011)]
msg_ns_rematch_02_talk_04	[~ 29]
msg_ns_rematch_02_talk_05	Then on behalf of Warden Arezu... Lady Lilligant!\nKindly honor this challenger with a battle![VAR 0114(0011)]
msg_ns_rematch_02_talk_50	Your fastest time for achieving victory over Lady\nLilligant is [VAR 0201(0000)]:[VAR 0201(0001)]:[VAR 0201(0002)].[VAR 0114(0011)]
msg_ns_rematch_02_talk_51	[~ 32]
msg_ns_rematch_02_talk_60	Are you all right, child?[VAR 0114(0011)]
msg_ns_rematch_02_talk_61	According to Warden Arezu, Lady Lilligant has\nbeen quite eager to battle you again.[VAR 0114(0011)]
msg_ns_rematch_02_talk_80	Quite the performance.[VAR 0114(0011)]
msg_ns_rematch_02_talk_81	You claimed this victory after [VAR 0201(0000)]:[VAR 0201(0001)]:[VAR 0201(0002)].[VAR 0114(0011)]
msg_ns_rematch_02_talk_82	Well, that’s a new record. Impressive![VAR 0114(0011)]
msg_ns_rematch_02_talk_83	Here, this is from me.[VAR 0114(0011)]
msg_ns_rematch_02_talk_84	Take this, too.[VAR 0114(0011)]
msg_ns_rematch_02_talk_85	Also, Warden Arezu had a message for you.\nShe said, “Please keep Lilligant company!”[VAR 0114(0011)]
msg_ns_rematch_null_06	[~ 41]
msg_ns_rematch_03_talk_01	It seems Arcanine has settled into his role as lord\nquite nicely. He’s learned how to control his\r\nfrenzied might and can use it in battle at will.[VAR 0114(0014)]
msg_ns_rematch_03_talk_02	Still, I’m sure you two could learn much from\neach other! What would you like to do?[VAR 0114(0014)]
msg_ns_rematch_03_talk_03	Of course. It was lovely seeing you again all\nthe same.[VAR 0114(0014)]
msg_ns_rematch_03_talk_04	[~ 45]
msg_ns_rematch_03_talk_05	Certainly.[VAR 0114(0014)]
msg_ns_rematch_03_talk_50	It seems your current record is [VAR 0201(0000)]:[VAR 0201(0001)]:[VAR 0201(0002)].[VAR 0114(0014)]
msg_ns_rematch_03_talk_51	[~ 48]
msg_ns_rematch_03_talk_60	Are you all right, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0014)]
msg_ns_rematch_03_talk_61	Arcanine really has grown strong, hasn’t he?\nYou’ve both done so well getting this far.[VAR 0114(0014)]
msg_ns_rematch_03_talk_80	That was a splendid match! I’m so proud of both\nyou and Arcanine.[VAR 0114(0014)]
msg_ns_rematch_03_talk_81	This time, you defeated him in [VAR 0201(0000)]:[VAR 0201(0001)]:[VAR 0201(0002)].[VAR 0114(0014)]
msg_ns_rematch_03_talk_82	How remarkable! You managed to best Arcanine\neven more quickly than before![VAR 0114(0014)]
msg_ns_rematch_03_talk_83	Such an outstanding victory must be celebrated!\nPlease accept this gift from me.[VAR 0114(0014)]
msg_ns_rematch_03_talk_84	And please take this as well.[VAR 0114(0014)]
msg_ns_rematch_03_talk_85	Thank you, truly, for training together with\nArcanine. It means so much to us both.[VAR 0114(0014)]
msg_ns_rematch_null_07	[~ 57]
msg_ns_rematch_04_talk_01	My dazzling lord, Electrode, is happily letting off\nsome pent-up electricity at present.[VAR 0114(0016)]
msg_ns_rematch_04_talk_02	Let’s hear it, then. What are you here to do?[VAR 0114(0016)]
msg_ns_rematch_04_talk_03	That might be the first smart decision I’ve seen\nyou make. So long, now![VAR 0114(0016)]
msg_ns_rematch_04_talk_04	[~ 61]
msg_ns_rematch_04_talk_05	If you must. Try not to get zapped...[VAR 0114(0016)]
msg_ns_rematch_04_talk_50	The fastest time you’ve managed is [VAR 0201(0000)]:[VAR 0201(0001)]:[VAR 0201(0002)].[VAR 0114(0016)]
msg_ns_rematch_04_talk_51	[~ 64]
msg_ns_rematch_04_talk_60	Gosh, still in one piece, are we? I did warn you\nnot to bite off more than you could chew.[VAR 0114(0016)]
msg_ns_rematch_04_talk_61	Well, no use crying about it. You can try again,\nbut prepare yourself well! Electrode is shockingly\r\nstrong, as you should know by now.[VAR 0114(0016)]
msg_ns_rematch_04_talk_80	I can’t believe what I’ve just seen...[VAR 0114(0016)]
msg_ns_rematch_04_talk_81	You took [VAR 0201(0000)]:[VAR 0201(0001)]:[VAR 0201(0002)] to win this battle![VAR 0114(0016)]
msg_ns_rematch_04_talk_82	How on earth did you beat Electrode so quickly?\nI have to say I find myself a tiny bit impressed.[VAR 0114(0016)]
msg_ns_rematch_04_talk_83	Here. A gift for you from the great Melli. Accept\nit with the honor it deserves.[VAR 0114(0016)]
msg_ns_rematch_04_talk_84	And here. You somehow avoided each and every\nattack Electrode hurled at you, so I’ll give you\r\na prize for dodging your little heart out.[VAR 0114(0016)]
msg_ns_rematch_04_talk_85	I suppose you’ll come trundling along for another\nrematch sometime, hm? We’ll be ready.[VAR 0114(0016)]
msg_ns_rematch_null_08	[~ 73]
msg_ns_rematch_05_talk_01	Avalugg, mighty Lord of the Tundra, is ready to\nstorm and rage mightily once again today—just as\r\nhe did when he was struck by that odd lightning![VAR 0114(0017)]
msg_ns_rematch_05_talk_02	What are you here to do?[VAR 0114(0017)]
msg_ns_rematch_05_talk_03	Yes, that’s for the best. Avalugg is too strong to\nbe a simple sparring opponent.[VAR 0114(0017)]
msg_ns_rematch_05_talk_04	[~ 77]
msg_ns_rematch_05_talk_05	All right! Let’s put those muscles to work![VAR 0114(0017)]
msg_ns_rematch_05_talk_50	Your fastest time to victory? Let’s see... That\nwould be [VAR 0201(0000)]:[VAR 0201(0001)]:[VAR 0201(0002)].[VAR 0114(0017)]
msg_ns_rematch_05_talk_51	[~ 80]
msg_ns_rematch_05_talk_60	That looked like a rough workout. I’ve gone\nahead and made sure your Pokémon are all right.[VAR 0114(0017)]
msg_ns_rematch_05_talk_61	Avalugg is a formidable opponent. As his warden,\nI feel such awe at his vast and mighty power![VAR 0114(0017)]
msg_ns_rematch_05_talk_80	You pulled off quite the feat besting my lord,\nAvalugg, in battle![VAR 0114(0017)]
msg_ns_rematch_05_talk_81	It seems this time, you and your muscles emerged\nvictorious in [VAR 0201(0000)]:[VAR 0201(0001)]:[VAR 0201(0002)].[VAR 0114(0017)]
msg_ns_rematch_05_talk_82	Well now, that’s a new record![VAR 0114(0017)]
msg_ns_rematch_05_talk_83	You gave it your all out there, so here’s\nsomething from me.[VAR 0114(0017)]
msg_ns_rematch_05_talk_84	And here—an extra reward. You’ve earned it![VAR 0114(0017)]
msg_ns_rematch_05_talk_85	Seems you worked up a good sweat. Nice job!\c\nDon’t go repeating this to Avalugg, but I can tell\nhe’s excited to meet you in battle again soon.[VAR 0114(0017)]
