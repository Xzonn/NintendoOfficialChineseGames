GamePlayGayaPaellaB_00_V	Cuisine in Spain varies from one region to the next. Galicia in\r\nthe west, Catalonia in the east, Andalusia in the south and the\r\nBasque Country in the north...each has its own specialties!
GamePlayGayaPaellaB_01_V	Paella is one such regional dish. It originates\r\nin the eastern region of Valencia, which borders\r\nthe Mediterranean and is blessed with an abundance\r\nof seafood.
GamePlayGayaPaellaC_00_V	It's no surprise then that the fish markets\r\nthere have all kinds of freshly-caught seafood\r\non sale--fish, shellfish, and crustaceans.
GamePlayGayaPaellaC_01_V	And it's the flavor of this seafood which\r\nis the very essence of a great paella!\r\nWe should be thankful for the sea's bounty.
GamePlayGayaNoodle1A_00_V	Oh, I nearly forgot! It's my wife's birthday today.\r\nI'd better make a dinner reservation, or I'll be in hot water.
GamePlayGayaNoodle1A_01_V	We have eight kids, but three of them have\r\nleft the nest already, so I'll need to book\r\na table for seven.
GamePlayGayaNoodle1A_02_V	Booking a table for seven is going to be tricky.\r\nMost places would just try to squeeze us onto\r\na table meant for six...
GamePlayGayaNoodle1B_00_V	Glad I remembered it's my wedding anniversary today.\r\nIf I don't book a table for dinner, I'll be toast.
GamePlayGayaNoodle1B_01_V	This one's our 17th anniversary.\r\nWe like to celebrate by going to\r\na different restaurant every year.
GamePlayGayaNoodle1B_02_V	On our 10th anniversary we went to a seaside restaurant,\r\nand for our 15th we were at a place up on a hill, as the sun set.\r\nIt was beautiful!
GamePlayGayaNoodle1C_00_V	Oh no! I'd completely forgotten--it's my daughter's birthday today!\r\nI'd better book a table for dinner, or else my goose is cooked.
GamePlayGayaNoodle1C_01_V	Today's my daughter's ninth birthday.\r\nShe takes after her mother, thank goodness!\r\nHahaha!
GamePlayGayaNoodle1C_02_V	She started learning the piano when she was only three, and\r\nshe's managed to win twelve competitions already!\r\nI'm so proud of her I could burst!
GamePlayGayaNoodle1_00_V	Today I think we'll go to a restaurant I know on 36th\r\nStreet that opened its doors in 1874. I first went there\r\n12 years ago, and it's been one of my favorite places ever since.
GamePlayGayaNoodle1_01_V	Uh, sorry about this, but I really need to take care\r\nof that reservation. Please, carry on.
GamePlayGayaNoodle2_00_V	Now then, where did I write down\r\ntheir phone number?
GamePlayGayaNoodle2A_00_V	I could've sworn it was on page five\r\nof my address book...\r\nAh, here it is! It was on page seven all along.
GamePlayGayaNoodle2B_00_V	Now, I must've left my notebook with\r\nthe number in it in locker 2...\r\nOr was it locker 4?
GamePlayGayaNoodle2_01_V	All right! Let's see now...\r\n6593--no, wait that's not it.\r\nIt's 3809...
GamePlayGayaNoodle2_02_V	OK, I'm going to call them now.\r\nExcuse me for a moment.
GamePlayGayaNoodle3A_00_V	I'm back. The restaurant's fully booked\r\ntonight, so no chance of going there.
GamePlayGayaNoodle3A_01_V	Well, that's too bad. I guess I'll\r\njust have to take care of dinner myself.\r\nIt's a good job I'm a chef!
GamePlayGayaNoodle3A_02_V	I think I'll kick things off with a trio of terrined vegetables,\r\nthen as a main, my specialty: pan-fried filet mignon with a\r\nsauce suprême of eight kinds of wild mushroom!
GamePlayGayaNoodle3A_03_V	Ah, I'm itching to get started already!
GamePlayGayaNoodle3B_00_V	I managed to snag a table for seven o'clock!\r\nJust the right time for dinner!
GamePlayGayaNoodle3B_01_V	Tonight's dinner will be just perfect. I can feel it!
GamePlayGayaNoodle3B_02_V	As it happens, the chef in this place is an old\r\nfriend of mine. We trained together 23 years ago.
GamePlayGayaNoodle3B_03_V	I can depend on him to deliver the goods.\r\nYou might say he's a "seasoned" chef!\r\nHohoho!
GamePlayGayaNoodle3_00_V	Oops, I think I let time run away from me as I was chatting.\r\nWhere were we?
