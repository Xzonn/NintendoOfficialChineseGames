ARC_CH_TXT_PL0000_0000	A beautiful young girl born from a bond between the Lumen Sages of light and the Umbra Witches of darkness. \n\nAs relations between these two clans are strictly forbidden, Cereza's birth resulted in her being labelled an outcast, scorned and mocked by the other Umbra.\n\nIn time, Cereza began to be tortured by nightmares of how powerless she was to help her mother, who had cared so deeply for Cereza. Becoming strong enough to one day help her became Cereza's one motivation for getting through each day.\n\nShe cherishes the stuffed cat toy her mother gave her, which she named "Cheshire". Never leaving her side, Cheshire often listens to the stories of the lonely girl.
ARC_CH_TXT_PL0000_0001	Tormented by the ridicule of her clan, Cereza ran off to live with a witch named Morgana, who resides just outside Avalon Forest. Morgana saw vast potential in Cereza despite her youth, and began training her rigorously in the Umbran Arts.\n\nThough a strict teacher, Cereza can feel a certain kindness from Morgana, and eventually has come to trust her like she would her mother.\n\nOne night, a young boy appears in Cereza's dreams, telling her that deep inside the forbidden Avalon Forest there sleeps something that could aid Cereza to find the power she seeks. She decides to believe the boy and heads off to the forest.\n\nAfter being chased by a pack of malevolent faeries, Cereza attempts to summon a demon, and the medium inadvertently becomes her own stuffed animal. Cereza decides to name the demon Cheshire, after the toy it possesses, and the two begin their strange and fateful journey.
ARC_CH_TXT_PL0000_0002	At the onset of their travels, the two realise they can very easily rub each other the wrong way. Cheshire often irritates Cereza by highlighting her inexperience. The last straw is when Cheshire gives a vigorous slash to Cereza's mother, causing her to disappear. The vision of Rosa is an illusion created by the faeries, but the shock to Cereza is real.\n\nAnd yet, after going their separate ways, Cereza realises that her strength does have limits, and she has come to rely on Cheshire. She realises that she appreciates Cheshire, and begins to be able to see things from his perspective. The two eventually reach an understanding, and afterwards they develop true bonds of friendship.
ARC_CH_TXT_PL0000_0003	The relationships Cereza forges during her time in Avalon leave her with unforgettable memories that will undoubtedly help shape her into a confident witch able to pursue her dream of becoming a powerful Umbra with a newfound determination.\n\nThis chapter of her journey having now reached its end, Cereza looks one last time at the house she trained with Morgana. Vowing to one day become a witch worthy of her mother, she steps off into the moonlight.
ARC_CH_TXT_PL1100_0000	A demon summoned by Cereza on the night of the full moon.\n\nTraditionally, Umbra Witches use their hair as a medium to control their demons, but the ritual proved too difficult for Cereza, and the demon somehow found himself in Cereza's stuffed toy.\n\nThe demon, humiliated by such a vessel, demanded to be returned to Inferno immediately, but the inexperienced Cereza had no idea how to help. And being bound to the magical energy of whoever summoned him, he realised he was unable to separate himself from her. Reluctantly, he agrees to accompany her just until they find a way to send him home.\n\nHaving been just newly born in Inferno when called, he had yet to be given a name. Cereza decides to simply call him Cheshire, after the name of the stuffed toy he inhabits.
ARC_CH_TXT_PL1100_0001	With his bone-crunching fangs and razor-sharp claws, Cheshire has confidence in his strength, and an itch to prove his superiority to others, jumping into battle whenever the opportunity arises.\n\nHe also just happens to have a notorious sweet tooth, especially for Inferno Fruit and Avalon Drops. With his keen nose he can usually discern any Avalon Drops Cereza might be hiding, and sometimes nabs a quick snack when she's distracted.\n\nHis demon nature would normally make him care only for destruction, but be it due to the hugs and affection that Cereza shows his medium, he feels an inexplicable fuzziness towards Cereza he can't understand.\n\nAt first, his teamwork with Cereza is shaky. Cheshire is especially frustrated with the cowardice she shows during their first encounter with the Jabberwock. And even though it was a trap created by the faeries, attacking the illusion of Cereza's mother sends a shock to Cereza so great a significant rift is born between them, sending them on their separate ways.
ARC_CH_TXT_PL1100_0002	Though not one to prefer the company of others, his time apart from Cereza gives him the chance to reflect on their journey, and fills him with strange feelings of concern and sorrow, both emotions demons were assumed unable to experience.\n\nAfter watching the bravery Cereza is capable of during his rescue and the care she shows sacrificing her hair to heal his wounds, Cheshire finally begins to accept Cereza as someone he relies on, and a bond between the two grows.\n\nWith Cereza, Cheshire is able to forge an irreplaceable bond of friendship most demons never experience. As of now, he is probably thrashing around Inferno, going wherever those brilliant claws lead him. Though he still might not be able to admit it, surely he is someday hoping for a fateful reunion.
ARC_CH_TXT_PL0050_0000	A young witch undergoing formal training in the Umbran Arts. Her skills already far surpass witches of her age, and she continues to master new arts at an astonishing pace.\n\nSome say her strict, serious demeanour makes her seem a bit cold, but she is extremely loyal and cares deeply for those she trusts.\n\nShe feels competitive towards Cereza, but she also sees her as a good friend. Whereas her peers may find Cereza's unorthodox training under a recluse witch to be unsightly, Jeanne recognises Cereza's true power and heart, and approaches her as an equal.
ARC_CH_TXT_PL0100_0000	An Umbra Witch unparalleled in skill, thought to possibly be the strongest in the entire history of the clan. Mother of Cereza.\n\nFalling in love with a Lumen Sage, she broke the sacred vows of the Umbra and bore a child with him, resulting in her eternal imprisonment.\n\nShe has never revealed why she would go against Umbran teachings and have forbidden relations with a Lumen, but she has accepted her isolation without the slightest resistance, despite all of the power she possesses. This has led many to think she understood and agreed to the consequences of her actions before even taking them.\n\nSome of the Umbra even sympathise with her plight, overlooking her daughter Cereza sneaking to her cell, or even finding chances for the two to meet.\n\nCereza's precious stuffed toy was made by Rosa from whatever she could gather. Before being moved to an even further prison, she would often sing lullabies as Cereza would rest against the steel bars of her cell, showing nothing but the deepest maternal love for her precious daughter.
ARC_CH_TXT_EM0200_0000	A wolf dwelling in Avalon with a mane white like winter snow.\n\n"The white wolf...guide you..." \nJust like the boy in Cereza's dream said, the wolf appears before Cereza and Cheshire, as if to lead them through the forest.
ARC_CH_TXT_EM0200_0001	Effortlessly evading each of Cheshire's initial attempts to slash at him, it seems that this nimble movement is the reason he is able to survive the dangerous Avalon Forest in the first place.
ARC_CH_TXT_EM0200_0002	Somehow aware of the location of the Elemental Cores, he appears before Cereza to show her where they rest.
ARC_CH_TXT_EM0200_0003	Inside the white wolf there is revealed to be the spirit of Lukaon, the true successor to the faerie kingdom, who was forced to escape there following a dispute for the throne. \n\nAs noble as the prince he is, he has struggled to protect and help all of the innocent who have somehow wandered into Avalon. While doing this, he has come across a fair number of young Umbra Witches, which he finds somewhat puzzling, but he works with the girls to try and help them escape Avalon. \n\nThe only way he can think of for them to accomplish this is for the girls to sacrifice their demon to restore his true power. Alas, every girl yet has met a tragic end before they can finalise their plan, which pains him greatly.
ARC_CH_TXT_EM0200_0004	After Lukaon's spirit left the wolf's body to return to its own, the wolf simply reverted to its natural self, and disappeared into the forest.
ARC_CH_TXT_EM1100_0000	A curious boy who enters Cereza's dreams and invites her to the forbidden land of Avalon.\n\nOnce Cereza enters the forest, he appears before her again in an ethereal form. He promises Cereza a great power if she will only destroy the Elemental Cores that sleep in the forest, breaking the seal that has been placed on him.
ARC_CH_TXT_EM1100_0001	Meeting Cereza from time to time along her journey, the two slowly learn about each other, and their common goal of each wishing to reunite with their mother. This similarity, along with his handsome face, makes Cereza realise she might have just a tiny crush on Lukaon. 
ARC_CH_TXT_EM1100_0002	He was born from the love between an Umbra Witch and the previous faerie king who ruled the faerie kingdom.\n\nHis father was a pacifist who wished to do away with many of the cumbersome traditions of the past, and envisioned an Avalon where faeries and humans could live together side by side. Lukaon, sharing the blood of both, was meant to serve as the symbol that would unite these groups together.\n\nBut one day, there was an insurgence led by a scheming faerie who succeeded in dethroning the king. With Lukaon's own life in danger, in a last minute attempt to save her son, Lukaon's mother transferred his spirit inside the white wolf, and he escaped into the forest.
ARC_CH_TXT_EM1100_0003	Lukaon's body was also just barely saved due to his mother's magic, but the faerie insurgents managed to get hold of it and sealed it away deep in the forest.\n\nReleasing the seal would require the life of a demon born on the night of a full moon. Lukaon has found many young witches lost in the forest whom he has tried to persuade to help him, guiding them with the white wolf.\n\nLukaon's reasons for doing this were never only to save himself, he simply wanted to see the girls released from the forest safely. Unbeknownst to him, it was his very own mother who had tricked these girls into Avalon in the first place.\n\nEven not having reached full maturity, there exists inside him truly phenomenal power. After having his seal finally released, he awakens the abilities he inherited from his father, the great faerie king.
ARC_CH_TXT_EM1100_0004	Seeing Cheshire as nothing but a tool for his ends, he finds himself in confrontation with Cereza. But having witnessed the bond that has formed between Cereza and her demon, he reconsiders his own actions.\n\nIn his last moments, he tries pleading to Morgana to remove the hatred from her heart, and not have others suffer for his own sake. He then finally falls to eternal rest, cradled softly in her arms.
ARC_CH_TXT_BA0100_0000	A solitary Umbra Witch, living an unimposing life near the edge of Avalon Forest, displaced far from the rest of her clan.\n\nA master of the Umbran Arts, her skills in magic greatly exceed those of other witches, but she cut ties with her clan and moved to her secluded home ages ago, her reasons for doing so an unspoken mystery.\n\nThough usually avoiding all contact with the outside world, she invited the practically orphaned Cereza to come live with her, and has since made Cereza her pupil, training her rigorously.
ARC_CH_TXT_BA0100_0001	Typically thought of as extremely strict and largely unpleasant, just her gaze is enough to send chills down the spine of its receiver. Yet she saw potential in Cereza, and her stern training has been effective in producing exemplary results from Cereza in remarkable time. Cereza has in turn learned to trust Morgana despite her seemingly cold ways. \n\nNot one to ever lose herself to emotion, everything she does appears perfectly calculated. This extends to the minions she summons from Inferno as well; she excels at their use, but they are tools to do her bidding, nothing more. \n\nShe reprimands Cereza thoroughly for disobeying her and entering Avalon Forest, but she promises to find a way to help, and uses her magic to watch over and communicate with Cereza.
ARC_CH_TXT_BA0100_0002	Her true identity is the mother of the faerie prince Lukaon. Even Cereza, who had lived with Morgana for some time, was unaware of Morgana's past.\n\nLong ago, during a dispute for the faerie kingdom, Morgana was forced to use her magic to transfer Lukaon's spirit to a wolf in order to hide him from the usurping faeries. Despite her efforts, the faeries were able to get away with Lukaon's physical body.\n\nIn the confusion, Morgana herself was able to escape to the outside of the forest, where the faerie's powers are unable to reach. But to protect the body the faeries stole, she was required to continuously cast a spell that would prevent her from either moving further away from the forest, or going back inside it.\n\nUnable to do any more by herself, Morgana began to train Umbra Witches still young and pure in heart, so she may eventually trick them to go into the forest. There, she planned to have them find Lukaon, so they may sacrifice their demon to save him.\n\nHer desperate wish to save her son gradually disfigured her soul into doing the unforgiveable. Looking at her actions, it may be hard to tell if any humanity remained inside her at all. Yet as she collapses to the ground, defeated by Cereza and Cheshire, in her arms lay the gift of violets Cereza had given her.
ARC_CH_TXT_EM0050_0000	An unsettling figure who surfaces from the shadows, then dissolves within them just as quickly. He can command many of the faeries of Avalon, and seems to have interest in Cereza and Cheshire's whereabouts.
ARC_CH_TXT_EM0050_0001	His name is Púca, and he claims himself to be the king of the faerie kingdom. He is bent on complete domination of Avalon, and commands an army of faeries in order to accomplish this.\n\nBeing neurotically cautious, he orders lower faeries to constantly patrol the forest for any invaders and extinguish them upon sight, no matter how helpless or innocent they may be.\n\nHe dons a cape several times taller than his own height, and acts overly haughty to anyone in his presence, albeit with a peculiar way of speaking. \n\nNot one to fight his own battles, he prefers instead to create strategies for how to eliminate his opposition. A talented user of faerie magic, he has succeeded in creating an illusion of the angel Affinity that he can control to his own will. His power should not be underestimated. 
ARC_CH_TXT_EM0050_0002	Originally a researcher serving under the former faerie king, Púca deciphered many human writings and, in turn, was able to create numerous inventions for the kingdom. He showed the talent of a brilliant scientist.\n\nThe Elemental Cores also happened to be of Púca's design, and their introduction into faerie society changed it radically. He was praised for his contributions to the kingdom, but he continued to seek power with an obsession, and eventually started to devise a plan to overthrow Avalon.\n\nOnce the faerie king revealed his son would be a human boy, Púca used this to create unease within the kingdom, building an army that he would lead to bring the kingdom to its downfall.
ARC_CH_TXT_EM0050_0003	He had hoped to acquire Lukaon's immense power for himself, but having his spirit hidden and body guarded by Morgana's magic, his only remaining option was to create a seal on the body with the Elemental Cores that would prevent Lukaon from ever recovering it.\n\nAnd once he finally does obtain Lukaon's power, he immediately thinks of taking his plans for conquest outside Avalon...only to have his life snuffed out by a single crushing blow from Morgana, who had been waiting for the moment patiently.
ARC_CH_TXT_BAFB10_0000	A wisp boy Cereza meets along her journey. Seeing him distraught, Cereza stops to talk to him, and learns many of his friends have been wisp-napped by the faeries. Colm's worries for his friends supersede any inhibition he may have had towards a stranger like Cereza and pleads to her to help.\n\nAs wisps are often said to be the wandering souls of those who have died in the forest, Colm's kindness is most likely something inherited from his former life. Most of the wisps see Colm as an unofficial leader they trust to organise their hidden community. He lives with the other wisps in a hideaway he has helped make with trash collected from the faeries' trash heap.
ARC_CH_TXT_BAFB10_0001	Most of his days he makes brave excursions to collect materials to help expand the hideaway, carefully avoiding faeries in the process. He serves as chief editor for the "Wisp Weekly", a newsletter he puts together consisting of snippets of useful information and other writings collected from wisps across the forest. His aim for the Weekly is to hopefully help wisps in places he might not even know about.\n\nThough its contents are relatively simple, reading each new issue has become a highly valued tradition for wisps who have little escape from the countless dangers in their life in Avalon.
ARC_CH_TXT_BAFB14_0000	A mysterious figure who appears suddenly before Cereza, introducing herself simply as one who knows about "the goings-on in the forest". She does seem well versed in the ways of Avalon, and tries to provide Cereza what guidance she can.\n\nShe seems to have something of a personal vendetta against the faeries, which is likely linked at least partially to her reasons for wanting to help Cereza.
ARC_CH_TXT_BAFB14_0001	Her true identity is one of the oldest wisps in Avalon. She has undoubtedly been through much to have survived through the treacherous times of Avalon, which has given her a more weathered appearance compared to the other wisps.\n\nShe knows of less trodden paths even the faeries have not discovered, and just about every shortcut the forest has to offer. She will gladly impart this wisdom to any travellers who might find it useful.
ARC_CH_TXT_BAFB14_0002	As a wisp, her frail form does not have the strength to contend with the faeries, but she always will lend a helping hand to those lost in the forest, and shows an especially keen interest in any young witches she may come across.\n\nShe is always calm and focused, never letting the faeries intimidate or get the best of her. Because of this many of the wisps think she must have been someone of considerable power in her previous life.
ARC_CH_TXT_BAFB14_0003	Long ago, a small band of thieves on a quest for power invaded Avalon, searching for the faerie kingdom's hidden treasures. A young witch of promising potential was sent to the forest to circumvent them, but legend says that ultimately neither her nor the thieves ever made it back out of the forest.\n\nSince that day, a powerful barrier was cast around the forest, allowing only those of pure heart to enter. The event served as a catalyst that would have many clamour for better relations between faeries and humans, which is likely to have enabled the first human queen in faerie kingdom history.\n\nThere are rumours the witch from that time is still alive somewhere in the forest, yet what connection this may have with Ignis, if any, is unproven.
ARC_EM_TXT_EM0000_000_0000	Rank: Tourmaline Knight\n\nA biped faerie that uses a spear its own height.\nDeveloping from quadrupeds after absorbing sufficient energy, they are seated relatively high along the faerie hierarchy. Often are placed within units of lower ranking faeries to step in when needed.\n\nBánánachs possess significant strength which they display through powerful jabs to keep their proximity in check. The wings on their back enable flight, and switching their strategy to a succession of aerial strikes is not uncommon. Aggressive by nature, once they have initiated their attack, they will not cease assault on a target until it has been completely incapacitated, lunging their massive bodies at their opponent to physically overwhelm them. The persistence with which they go after their opponent has likened them to an enraged demon among the other faeries. And yet, they also seem to have a strong sense of pride, insisting on fighting their enemies head on.
ARC_EM_TXT_EM0000_001_0000	Rank: Jade Knight\n\nAn elite biped faerie that uses a large spear in their right hand, and sturdy shield their left. Skilled in reading an enemy's movement, they have won their way through many battles by blocking an incoming attack, making an opening, and answering with a swift jab of their spear. Because of their emphasis on defence, they are often called "gatekeepers" by other faeries, which is also likely related to why many of them are assigned guard duty around faerie fortresses.\n\nTheir shield is forged with a precious metal called orichalcum, and greatly surpasses the defensive abilities of shields used by common faeries. Due to this metal's scarcity, not many of these shields exist, making Fomhórach themselves quite rare. Most Fomhórach are veteran fighters who have been around since Avalon's feudal era.\n\nAnother reason for being called "gatekeepers" likely comes from their dedication to law and servitude. They show no hesitation to strike down swift justice on any resident of Avalon causing disorder, even if it were a fellow faerie.
ARC_EM_TXT_EM0000_002_0000	Rank: Amethyst Knight\n\nA biped faerie wizard that summons spirits known as Barghest to do its bidding in battle. Able to summon large numbers of spirits simultaneously, they are often likened to a shepherd with a herd of sheep on the battlefield.\n\nWhen fighting, they make a point of staying out of the action, providing assistance through their summons. Their offensive strategies consist of summoning enough Barghest to overwhelm their opponent. And, if ever finding themselves in danger, they can easily recall any of their Barghest to act as a shield.\n\nDifferent from the relationship between Infernal Demons and the Umbra, which is based on a pact, the Faun manipulate their summons through mind control. This means those particularly gifted in mind manipulation learn to control much more than just Barghest. Legend even has it that a small town almost disappeared overnight after a Faun assumed control of the town's youth.
ARC_EM_TXT_EM0000_003_0000	Rank: Spinel Knight\n\nA biped faerie wizard with excellent knowledge of and proficiency in faerie magic. Many of Avalon's most powerful spellcasters are Sparcanagh. Their preferred way of fighting is to come at an opponent with an onslaught of spells, not giving them even the smallest of openings to respond. With negative vibes being the source of their magic power, the more they intimidate or scare an opponent, the more powerful their spells become.\n\nNaturally curious, they spend most of their days exploring the forest for ancient writings, hoping to learn about new spells or enhancements. And while most of their spells have practical application, some they discover turn out to be mostly useless. Always anxious to try their new magic out, their fellow faeries stand the risk of being debilitated by a spell the Sparcanagh don't yet understand. 
ARC_EM_TXT_EM0000_004_0000	Rank: Topaz Knight\n\nA high ranking faerie commander suited in bulky armour and brandishing a giant mace. To Gog-Magog, nothing would be worth the cost of jeopardising the battle. When needed, they will throw themselves to the front lines, overpowering their opponent with their incredible might.\n\nTaking pride in their heritage, Gog-Magog use arms that have been passed down from a long line of ancestors. According to faerie tradition, the only way a faerie other than a Gog-Magog would ever be allowed use of their weapons and armour would be if an extremely decorated soldier challenged one to a duel and came out victorious.\n\nBy far the most skilled fighters of the biped faeries, they avoid all-out offensives, favouring to adapt their strategy as required. Between their impenetrable armour and calculated, devastating blows, they are truly a force to be reckoned with. It is said that simply the glaring eyes protruding from deep within their helmet can send such pure dread in an opponent to induce surrender immediately.
ARC_EM_TXT_EM0000_005_0000	Rank: Topaz Knight\n\nA biped spellknight with a gift for flame and stone magic.\n\nSkilled in both physical attacks and magic, Mulciber usually fight in a style that utilises both. Their proficiency with defensive stone spells allows them to cast barriers on fellow faerie fighters, and their flame magic is said to be able reach extreme temperatures; those who anger Mulciber are often suddenly reduced to ash.\n\nUsing magic fuelled by negative vibes, burns induced by Mulciber take much longer to recover. Always seeking ways to strengthen their firepower, they hunt for negative vibes even more aggressively than regular faeries. \n\nTo faeries, the power of flame magic can be so intense that it eventually consumes one's soul entirely, resulting in a complete loss of sanity. Mulciber are no exception in this matter, with many of them displaying questionable levels of mental stability. On the battlefield they simply go berserk, becoming unstoppable until they burn out of energy completely.
ARC_EM_TXT_EM0010_001_0000	Rank: Pawn\n\nThe most commonly seen quadruped faerie of Avalon. They are known to be slightly moody, but universally love to play tricks. Souls are their main source of sustenance, and they usually live off the negative vibes acquired from tormenting humans and wisps. They also vary in size; Aos Sí who have lived for longer periods tend to be larger and significantly more dangerous.\n\nAmong faeries, they are an inferior breed with no special abilities to speak of, but their basic physical strength still averages with that of an adult human. As they can use both weapons and magic, they can pose a significant threat in their own right. That being said, most have a poor sense of sight, hearing, and smell, and can thus usually be avoided by simply hiding.\n\nThey are usually tasked with minor guard duty, instructed to report anything suspicious to their commanding faerie officers. Being discovered by one could quickly result in a whole faerie army coming to their aid, so it is usually best to avoid confrontation when unnecessary.
ARC_EM_TXT_EM0010_002_0000	Rank: Pawn\n\nA quadruped faerie wielding a cannon created with Avalonian weaponsmithing. Desperate for any opportunity to open fire, and usually will do so the instant an enemy is spotted. The cannon has poor accuracy and Bogies have terrible aim, but the ammunition it uses can be quite damaging in the off chance it hits. As the shots themselves are also not particularly fast, they can be safely avoided if one watches the trajectory closely.\n\nBogie are primarily tasked to find humans and lure them to larger groups of faeries. To accomplish this they station themselves in one spot, waiting for passersby. Of course, they're not good at waiting, and usually start blasting away for some reason before long enough.\n\nThe ammunition they use is relatively simple to make, so they essentially never run out - if spotted, it's advantageous to take them out of the picture early.
ARC_EM_TXT_EM0010_003_0000	Rank: N/A\n\nA rudimentary machine created by the faeries with the supposed purpose of scaring intruders.\nSimply put, it's a walking bomb. It contains enough explosives to clear away a large chunk of debris, so it's probably a good deal too strong for just intimidation tactics. If you walk into one you're probably dead, but that's a design flaw that doesn't particularly bother the faeries.\n\nThe bombs are built using bombagranates from the forest with a dash more firepower applied through faerie magic. Many faeries comment the noise it makes upon detonation sounds like a loud, banshee-esque scream, which they took into consideration when deciding its name.\n\nWhile able to move around by itself to some extent, in order to prevent any disastrous false detonations, it requires to be given an objective before it is armed. This configuration needs to, however, be done by a faerie, and the slightest impact after its completion will result in immediate detonation, making this job rather unpopular among faeries.
ARC_EM_TXT_EM0010_004_0000	Rank: Pawn\n\nA quadruped faerie that uses a large shield to protect itself and other faeries from enemy attacks. Receiving formal training from its biped seniors, it is capable of fending off most attacks from the front. Unfortunately, just managing that requires most of its concentration, which also means it is rarely successful in being of any help to its allies. It also seems so fixated on protecting itself that it forgets to attack.\n\nSpriggans' shields were forged from adamant ore during Avalon's feudal period. The shields are maintained by the Spriggans collectively and kept in near flawless condition. If any are ever lost, it is considered the group's responsibility. \n\nThe curly tip design at the shield's top often snags on things in the forest and most Spriggans wish it could be removed.
ARC_EM_TXT_EM0010_005_0000	Rank: N/A\n\nA faerie spirit summoned by Fauns. They tend to have a fairer complexion than flesh and blood faeries, and the trademark of being faintly transparent. Though a spirit, the Fauns' magic gives them a corporeal form in this world. Fauns largely summon Barghest for this reason - so they can be a physical shield whenever harm comes a Faun's way. Having no will of their own, the Barghest have no choice but to be used as their Faun master sees fit.\n\nReborn as a spirit after dying in Avalon, they could be said to be for faeries what wisps are to humans. The faeries have no culture of showing respect to their dead, so they are not honoured. After some research, they seem unable to release negative vibes no matter how much they are tormented, so most faeries find little use for them.\n\nThere are instances of some simply appearing out of thin air, wandering the forest aimlessly, but they are rarely tied to the earthly world for too long.
ARC_EM_TXT_EM0010_006_0000	Rank: Pawn\n\nA faerie wizard with a flaming staff. Though a wizard by name, they are limited to using flame magic. Still, the flame magic of faeries can be quite powerful, and Salamander are able to create raging flames that can grow many times larger than their tiny stature. While other faeries typically would value their assistance on the sidelines, sometimes their spells slip out of their control and fry their allies.\n\nThough flame magic is something that has existed among the faeries for ages, each faerie's aptitude is decided for the most part at birth and can range drastically. Salamanders display more natural talent than other faeries, and they show a fair bit of pride regarding this.\n\nSalamander sometimes will sneak into human villages to play tricks by setting things on fire, so they are typically associated with fire to humans as well. Only, as faeries are not known to use flame magic, they are simply considered to be faeries drawn to the flame.
ARC_EM_TXT_EM0010_007_0000	Rank: Pawn\n\nA quadruped faerie wizard with a pointy hat. While still being a lesser faerie, they have acquired a few useful spells, including teleportation and duplication. Their offensive arsenal may not be as powerful as that of higher ranking faeries, but it generally serves its purposes. Their trademark in combat is to trap their enemy and make them suffer slowly. To their opponent's advantage, they're not especially quick spellcasters.\n\nThey are quite studious and learn most faerie magic fundamentals under biped wizard faeries known as "Sparcanagh." But they are always seeking out additional knowledge, sometimes going as far as to dig through the forgotten belongings of humans who disappeared here. Their triangle hat is said to be them mimicking human culture in a show of respect for the great wizards of legend.\n\nOn a strange side note, they casts their spells in a low, soft voice that has been likened to whispering sweet nothings to an admirer.
ARC_EM_TXT_EM0010_008_0000	Rank: Pawn\n\nA quadruped faerie with a clunky helmet covering most of their head. Originally Aos Sí, their helmets are received from higher ranking officers when promoted. Their control of their abilities surpasses those of normal quadrupeds, and they have trained tirelessly to build an indomitable fortitude. Undoubtedly the strongest of all the quadruped faeries, they may possibly hold their own with some of the bipeds. This is all greatly diminished by the fact that their helmet is so big and heavy they can barely see anything.\n\nStill, to a Dvergr, their helmet is their greatest source of pride. Though they take care of it with great dedication, its overall craftsmanship is substandard, and it breaks easily upon impact. For this reason, many Dvergr learn how to forge and repair armour, and by result of this, assist in the maintenance of other faerie's armour as well. Some Dvergr have even gone so far as to retire from the battlefield completely and hammer away all day in their smithy to provide adequate weaponry for all faerie kind. 
ARC_EM_TXT_EM0010_009_0000	Rank: Pawn\n\nA shrewd faerie excelling at planting traps around Avalon to snatch up the unsuspecting. Most are well versed in the forest's byways, knowing just the inconspicuous spots to set a trap for maximum effect; a true nuisance of a faerie.\n\nLikely due to the fact that their principal targets are humans and wisps, they often will place jewels or other shiny objects near their traps as bait. Some are even cunning enough to make their own treasure chests and then booby trap the area around it. Those unknowing of these admonishable habits think of the Leipreachán as a "safekeeper of treasure", and believe them to know where buried gold and other treasures may be hidden.\n\nThe traps they make are built using wood straight from the forest, meaning there is no shortage of materials. This has made it possible for the Leipreacháns to build an absurd amount of traps in the forest. Some wild faeries of the forest have even taken to copying Leipreacháns in recent years, leaving traps in all sorts of strange places.
ARC_EM_TXT_EM0010_013_0000	Rank: Pawn\n\nA quadruped faerie that dons a unique spiralling helmet. Knockers use this helmet like a drill and spin their bodies to burrow into the ground. The helmet is made more than durable enough to withstand this. This technique is primarily used to dig underground tunnels for transporting energy, but when in battle, Knockers can use it to spring up from under their opponent with a shockingly powerful attack. The offensive ability of this assault makes them an enemy to be feared.\n\nSince they spend most of their day burrowed in the ground, they have even worse eyesight than that of a typical faerie. They also seem to be weak to sunlight, and as so, do not like to be above ground for longer than necessary. Because of this, there are actually faeries who don't even know Knockers exist.\n\nTheir constant burrowing has led them to discover many locations of hidden jewels and beds of ore. Sadly, they aren't the most generous faeries and tend to keep this information a secret from anyone, other faeries included. \n\n
ARC_EM_TXT_EM0010_014_0000	Rank: Amber Knight\n\nA mischievous clown in training. They belong to the Amadán Circus Troupe, where they used to learn under Amadán Dubh until he lost his mind. Since then they have taken over his work as general overseer of Faerieland Tower, where they are in charge of collecting negative vibes via wisp torment.\n\nWhile still learning to be a clown, they have displayed expert skill in turning wisp torment into a performance art, and accumulated a great amount of negative vibes due to it.\n\nThough relatively weak for a faerie, they are devious schemers, always thinking of new tricks to try, each one almost unanimously translatable to an effective method of wisp torment.\n\nUsing the wisp energy they have collected, they have learned how to create barriers for themselves, but overall they're not very threatening in battle.
ARC_EM_TXT_EM0015_000_0000	Rank: Pawn\n\nA faerie that randomly formed large wings that allow it to fly freely in the sky. Normally they spend their time patrolling Avalon from the skies, swooping down to alert the other faeries of anything suspicious they may come across. Their wings also prove useful for carrying supplies to different parts of the forest.\n\nAs fighters, they are fairly strong, picking out unsuspecting prey from the sky with the cannon latched on them. Still, as if in exchange for their wings, their bodies are frail, and most can be knocked out of the air with a single well-placed hit.\n\nWhat causes these sudden wing growths in faeries has been researched, but no conclusive evidence has been discovered. As such, most attempts to create more Pixies are done through mere guesswork, and few have been successful so far, making Pixies relatively rare.
ARC_EM_TXT_EM0120_000_0000	Rank: Sapphire Bishop\n\nA faerie so rare that only a handful are said to exist in Avalon.\n\nFrom birth, they possess physical strength and magic ability far greater than that of other bipeds, and as such have the reputation of a one-faerie army. \n\nDue to their incredible skill, many have appeared beside the royalty of past faerie dynasties, and faeries would often rumour that allying with a Murúch was the easiest way to becoming the next faerie king.\n\nOut of their magic abilities, they seem to prefer ice, and are able to use it to adapt to any situation, from long-distance ice blasts to propelling themselves with ice to charge at the enemy. The earth-shattering power of their every attack is so incredible that it is advised to never attempt to face them head on.\n\nMany Murúch are seated in influential roles in the faerie kingdom and possess considerable authority. If ever an enemy appears that proves too much for any of their subordinates, Murúch will step in to deal swift justice.
ARC_EM_TXT_EM0150_000_0000	Rank: Emerald Rook (Revoked)\n\nA gigantic dragon faerie usually found near Wyvern Falls. \n\nHe considers anything other than himself food, even munching down other faeries when so inclined. He spends most of his day hunting for meals, most likely in order to maintain his sizeable figure. All of Avalon is overcome by an intense dread just hearing the flap of his wings as he takes off to survey from the sky.\n\nHe partakes in many...exotic foods, especially bombagranates, the explosive fruit of a flower originally found in Inferno. If spotting any mid-flight, he will dive down to gobble up a mouthful immediately.\n\nHis body is covered in durable scales, said to be stronger than even metal. In the past, other faeries have made many attempts to slay him, but failing to penetrate his hardened exterior, they instead inevitably become the Jabberwock's lunch. There is little more terrifying a sound than his thundering screech, which itself alone causes shockwaves powerful enough to rip apart your insides.
ARC_EM_TXT_EM0150_000_0001	Despite his seemingly savage instincts, he possesses an intelligence on par with most of the other faeries in Avalon, and is known to form alliances when determined self-beneficial. There was a time he offered his powers of destruction to the Faerie King Moltred, but was eventually thwarted and sealed away by his successor, Arthur. Later, this seal would be removed by the self-proclaimed king, Púca, with whom another brief alliance was formed, only for the Jabberwock to ignore most of Púca's orders and run amok in Avalon until Púca was forced to throw him into a cage near Wyvern Falls. It was not long, however, until the Jabberwock had escaped the cage and was again ravaging the forest. Ultimately, no one was truly able to contain the beast until he finally met his demise.
ARC_EM_TXT_EM0300_000_0000	Rank: Amber Jester\n\nRing leader of the Avalon circus "Amadán's Big Top".\n\nA true master showman with impeccable talent to dazzle a crowd, Amadán Dubh was once well known across Avalon for his many daring circus acts centred around stage wisps (including the "Great Wisp Cannonball", where they packed 10 wisps into a circus cannon).\n\nTo Dubh, nothing is more satisfying than terrifying a poor wisp. He spends most of his days trying to devise his next devious wisp torment.\n\nSome time ago, the circus boasted a decent troupe, and were without a doubt the most popular attraction in Avalon. Dubh was happy with his success and had personal hopes to make his circus bigger and better. But eventually he became so fixated on endlessly perfecting his shows of terror that he eventually lost sight of all else, and his sanity slipped away permanently. The door to his circus has since been closed, and he stays locked in all day doing shows for no one other than himself.\n\nIn the beginning, he was a faerie with a quite common, small stature who just happened to be the first in the forest to study circus performance when it came to Avalon. In his early studies, he focused on basic performance art, but gradually shifted to more wisp-based acts, which quickly became a huge sensation. This surge to fame resulted in mass wisp-suffering, creating an excess of negative vibes that he absorbed to become his wobbly clown-self now.
ARC_EM_TXT_EM0300_000_0001	His intuitive skills for maximising the output of negative vibes through his circus wisp acts caught the attention of Púca, who praised his work and invited him to his elite council. This led to Dubh's time as the general overseer of Faerieland Tower, where he was further recognised by Púca for reforming his circus tent to double as a source of protection of the Stone Shrine. Records still exist from this era of Dubh requesting increased support and advertising of his circus in repayment for his good work.
ARC_EM_TXT_EM0100_000_0000	Hierarchy: Third Sphere, Angels (?)\n\nA common angel from the third sphere of the angel hierarchy, summoned by Púca. \n\nAffinity are considered the closest existence to humans among the angels; their halo is said to be able to guide the misled when they descend from Paradiso. Though they are seated on the lowest sphere of the angel hierarchy, their strength still far exceeds human comprehension. An average person would likely be unable to so much as touch one. The divine weapons that these angels wield possess considerable power, able to shatter the earth's surface with a single strike.\n\nThis Affinity, however, is not an actual angel, but an illusion formed by piecing together the collective consciousness of past witches who entered Avalon. It is required to stay close to Púca in order to survive, but its strength is proportionate to that of a real Affinity. Púca has recently found great use for it in removing unwanted disturbances to his plans.\n\nOriginally, Púca had developed a plan to brainwash an army of Affinity to serve under him after he discovered a way to open a portal to Paradiso. This plan fell flat when Púca realised that his mind control tricks proved useless on the angels. But still desperately wanting to obtain angelic power, he resumed his studies of Paradiso, eventually learning how he might be able to create an Affinity illusion. Though it is ultimately only a projection, the fact it looks like he has a real angel under his command tickles his narcissist nature perfectly.
ARC_EM_TXT_EM1000_000_0000	Lukaon after returning to his faerie form by partially absorbing Cheshire's soul to remove the seal on his own. Though the full extent of his power is still not realised, he boasts strength several hundred times over that of ordinary faeries. Possessing innate talents from both parents and having started practising from a young age, he knows spells for every situation. His physical strength is equally a threat; he can reduce even the thickest tree trunks in Avalon to splinters with a single swoop of his claws.\n\nHe is kind-natured in spirit and does not enjoy fighting, but when the situation has become unavoidable, he will show his enemy no mercy. Once engaged, he will not relent until his opponent's demise is certain, attacking repeatedly with swift, determined strikes.\n\nThough still young, he already possesses both the power and maturity needed to succeed the throne, making him the prime obstacle to Púca's ambition, and reason to seal Lukaon away using the power of the Elemental Cores.
ARC_EM_TXT_EM1000_000_0001	Born between faerie and human, something strictly forbidden in Avalon, he grew up despised and neglected by the other faeries. Still, he shows no spite for his parents - on the contrary, he cares about both deeply, and has trained himself daily to be stronger, so his father and mother may be proud of him. \n\nThe time spent with his mother Morgana, learning magic, forms many of his most cherished memories. He is both grateful to Morgana for showing him how to be strong, and proud that he is able to carry on his mother's teachings.
ARC_EM_TXT_EM2000_000_0000	Cereza's teacher Morgana, revealing her true self after Lukaon's situation becomes critical. While Morgana still belonged to the Umbra, she was seen with great promise, showing potential to surpass even the elders in terms of ability. She was exiled after it was discovered she carried the Faerie King Arthur's child. She loves her son deeply, resolving to do whatever possible to save him, no matter the cost to anyone else.\n\nHaving lived through the feudal period of Avalon with Arthur, through the conflict she faced, she naturally amassed an amount of techniques far exceeding that of other Umbrans. This wealth of knowledge has only been honed further in recent years as she has waited for the chance to exact revenge on Púca. These powers can instil true fear to any who would oppose her, and crush them completely when they do.\n\nLuring her opponents in a dimension of her own design where her Umbran abilities are amplified, she uses her contracted demon to hunt her enemy, just as a spider might trap their prey in a web.
ARC_EM_TXT_EM2010_000_0000	Morgana's Infernal Demon; a spider covered in thorns.\n\nAfter losing both husband and son in Púca's plan to usurp the throne, Morgana herself was exiled from Avalon. It was then she made a pact with Lex Talionis, swearing she would one day have her revenge.\n\nEach of its nimble legs are able to stab with astounding speed and strength. Every thorn on her body produces a nerve-rotting poison capable of immobilising even the largest of beasts with a single drop.\n\nIn Inferno, Lex makes her web in the blood red River Styx, where she does nothing but trap and devour prey, unable to ever extinguish her uncontrollable rage. Her insatiable hunger and thirst only torture and anger her further. She cannot be communicated with by normal means, but she is able reveal her inner thoughts to those she sympathises with. Understanding Morgana through her lust for revenge towards Púca, she decided to form a pact with her.\n\nMorgana thinks of Lex as nothing more than a mere tool for her revenge, but she does understand the extremes of Lex's strength, and values her because of this. Her favoured tactic is to create a giant illusion of herself to distract her opponent while Lex rips away at its target. As of yet, none have been able to overcome it.
ARC_EM_TXT_EM2020_000_0000	Morgana, after growing desperate in her fight against Cereza and Cheshire, deciding to use the full extent of her power. Using a forbidden Umbran Art, she merges her body with that of Lex Talionis into a twisted, half-witch/half-spider form. Lex is effectively just a vessel for Morgana; her consciousness is completely under Morgana's control.\n\nThe Umbran Art through which Morgana accomplishes this fusion is known as Daemon Masquarata; it has been sought after by a small group of Umbra for centuries. Very few have ever been able to perform it successfully, with failure resulting in the caster's soul being devoured by their demon immediately. Morgana and Lex are able to fuse together because of the perfect emotional sync between them - each have nothing but endless rage built up in their heart.\n\nBetween Lex's crushing, poisonous stabs with its legs and Morgana's endless assault of spells, this human-demon hybrid chases their target in relentless pursuit, never giving them the slightest opening to counterattack.\n\nAs maintaining this form consumes an incredible amount of both physical and magical energy, Morgana knows she can only use it as an absolute last resort. Once unleashed, there is no promise she will ever be able to return to her original self. For the sake of saving her son, she sacrifices her own safety and throws her all into the final confrontation.\n\nTwo Umbra...formerly teacher and student. One demanding obedience, the other practising trust. One using their demon as a tool, the other approaching it as a friend. This tale is about which of these bonds stands stronger in the end.
ARC_ARCHIVE_NOTE_TXT_0001	At last...finally, I have arrived! The realm of illusions, where souls may enter, but never return...the elusive Avalon Forest! Almost no scientific records exist on the ecosystems inside this expansive region...not something you get to walk into everyday! I've no doubt I'll be uncovering some marvellous mysteries of mother nature! A place like this is every biologist's DREAM...and it's all mine for the taking! Yes, I'm sure that the university may be somewhat surprised that I simply up and left without a word but, well, we can always worry about that later.\n\nLet's get right into some observations, shall we? The first thing I've noticed upon entering the forest is the absolutely massive size of its plantlife...the forest soil must have an extraordinary amount of nutrients to produce such size and quantity. There are a few varieties of flower here that grow taller than myself! In particular, I've noticed two that use their buds in very unexpected ways: one for catching prey, the other for striking it. The latter walloped me right on the head, actually. Amazing! Currently I've decided to name these two the "Bud Eater" and "Bud Beater".\n\nOh, I'm excited to see what we discover next!
ARC_ARCHIVE_NOTE_TXT_0002	As mentioned in my last entry, most of the plantlife in this forest is of spectacular size. Yet recently I've come across certain varieties that seem stunted in their growth...I've kept a close eye on them the past few days but they look as if they are in stasis...despite the nutrient-rich soil here, there must be some kind of sustenance they are not receiving. I'm currently entertaining a theory they may be an alien species that has yet to fully assimilate with Avalon's environment. Oh, how I wish I could just ask them myself...! But alas, I do not speak the language of plants. \nThese past few days I've found some curious specimens scattered about the forest floor...glimmering, dark crimson petals, and some kind of sweetish candy. As for the petals, they're not from anything I readily recognise, but I suspect they could be from an "Onyx Rose"...an otherworldly flower said to be prized by faeries...who just happen to be rumoured to live in Avalon. If so, perhaps the candy is also some snack of theirs...? I can only hope that these findings may eventually lead me to an actual faerie!
ARC_ARCHIVE_NOTE_TXT_0003	What I'm about to write may sound incredible at first, but bear with me. I have seen it with my very own eyes. There was a tooth...and it was walking. I promise you I am of sound mind and body. And I swear, the tooth walked! At first I surmised that perhaps it was simply some rare biological beast with a striking tooth-resemblance. But the longer I observed it, I became absolutely positive that it must be a human tooth. Well, yes, it did have eyes, and was quite sizeable compared to regular human teeth, and of course there is the whole walking bit...but I'm still certain it must have been a tooth! Might it be possible that the faeries have cast some sort of magic on the teeth of humans who disappeared in the forest...? What am I saying...as a scientific scholar I shouldn't suggest such outlandish theories.\n\nI've decided to name these creatures "Denter". Their primary source of sustenance seems to be the faerie candy that I came across before, which likely explains why most of them seem to have a few cavities. Be warned, they seem to be extremely territorial of any candy nearby them.
ARC_ARCHIVE_NOTE_TXT_0004	I discovered what is likely the remains of a campground within the forest - perhaps I am not the first human to step foot in here. Even more curious, on the ground nearby I found a crumpled flyer - it was advertising a circus of all things! Don't tell me that someone had the idea to set up a circus here! I apologise, I shouldn't even be entertaining such ridiculous notions. Though if I do happen to come across another human in this forest, I will have much to ask them...\n\nAnyway, let's put that balderdash aside for the moment, shall we? Back to the plantlife here. Recently I've come across a plant that looked like a giant peapod. I gave a mighty tug on what seemed to be the tip of its stem, and what do you think should happen? The pod split open, pouring out plentiful amounts of faerie candy! Could this sweet, glowing candy really come from a plant like this? But no...I remember seeing the same candy produced by other plants here as well. Perhaps this candy is some kind of purified crystalline energy that the ecosystem here generates naturally...and could that mean this sweet excess is actually full of forest nutrients? No wonder the faeries love it so!
ARC_ARCHIVE_NOTE_TXT_0005	It's been some time now since beginning my trek in Avalon, but it seems like the forest still has much to teach me. The other day I stumbled across a curious type of plant: its tall stem held a single piece of fruit...not remarkable at first glance, but trust me this was no run-of-the-mill berry. A short time after being picked, the fruit exploded! And I am not talking about a party cracker-sized pop, either. No, this was a full-blown BANG! Had I been but a few steps closer this journal would have come to an abrupt end.\n\nAnother peculiarity of this plant is, for better or worse, the ratio that were able to actually bear these explosive fruits was fairly low. Perhaps this plant is also not indigenous to Avalon and struggling to adapt.\n\nAs the fruit resembles a large pomegranate, I've decided to call these plants "bombagranate" for the time being. \n\nHmmm...I realise now that if I were to ever publish these journals, there would likely be a horde of evildoers rushing into the forest to misuse these explosive plants. I suppose I have no choice but to take these writings to the grave, then!
ARC_ARCHIVE_NOTE_TXT_0006	After a perilous climb over a mountain of giant mushrooms, I have found a completely new ecosystem within the forest: an elevated area riddled with long, winding branches covered with moss. It's quite slippery, but some of my findings are astonishing. Of particular interest is one plant that may possibly be a subspecies of the Bud Beaters I have written about previously. They line up along the vines, waiting for prey to cross...and swiftly clamp together to crush unsuspecting passersby. Seeing how they are secluded to this higher area, I assume they must be the product of selective adaptation. I say, it was a dastardly journey up those mushrooms, but I'm glad I persevered through it. Seeing as how they suddenly clamp their prey, I've decided to name them Bud Clamps. \n\nOh yes, and in very unscientific news, I seem to have discovered what looks like a ghost. It was about the height of a child and ghastly white, with an ever-so-faint glow. It ran off as soon as I approached it; it must be shy I suppose. I only hope to see it again so I may gather a little more factual information regarding it.
ARC_ARCHIVE_NOTE_TXT_0007	I'm truly astounded by the tremendous findings I've uncovered since coming to this forest. The other day I saw an absolutely enormous lily pad...it was so great in size that it held me while floating on the lake with no trouble at all. I know my peers might say it was just an oversized Victoria Amazonica, but trust me, the Victoria Amazonica cannot hold the weight of a full-grown adult. These lily pads are several times sturdier and larger. If I dare say, it's nothing short of one of the greatest botany findings of the last few centuries. \n\nSeemingly native to this forest, I've decided to give it the name "Faeria Avalonica". Currently I am considering trying to use the lily pad as a vessel to transport me to yet unreached corners of the forest.\n\nAlso, while I've no scientific evidence to prove it at the moment, I feel like someone or something has been watching me for the past few days. Be it another human, or possibly the ghost-like figure I encountered previously, I cannot say. But it has been watching me...of that I am certain. Wait now...there's a third possibility that has just struck me. Could these watching eyes be the source of the various faerie legends for which Avalon is so infamous?! If that is true, it's absolutely essential that I research them further...
ARC_ARCHIVE_NOTE_TXT_0008	Avalon contains a large web of lakes. The largest I have found thus far is actually located near the forest's entrance, where I first discovered the Faeria Avalonica. Upon this lily pad I uncovered numerous other sections of Avalon, though I did almost get swallowed up in a whirlpool as well. Perhaps I should be just a tad more careful of my surroundings; I am in a forest of uncharted peril after all. \n\nI digress...today I have something truly remarkable to write about. At last, I have found them...faeries! They do exist! At least, I am assuming what I have discovered are the same legendary creatures rumoured to dwell in Avalon, though I suppose their appearance is different than how they are typically described. There seem to be both bipeds and quadrupeds. I say “seem” here as I have yet to observe the creatures as clearly as I would desire; they reside within a thick mist that distorts the shape and colour of everything within, as if seeing the world through a prism or kaleidoscope. Still, their actions are orderly and highly intelligent, and as I had hoped I appear to interest them greatly. I assume the eyes watching me earlier belonged to them. Perhaps if I were to reach out to contact them, I could learn even more...\n
ARC_ARCHIVE_NOTE_TXT_0009	There was this ethereal old lady and big white wolf. I think they helped me. But, I guess it was too late, because it looks like I'm a wisp now. I must've died.\n\nThat makes sense because I can see right through my hands!\n\nWell, I'm sad about dying and all, but my mind seems mostly intact. I heard there are a lot of other wisps in this forest that the monsters...the faeries do all sorts of mean things to. I must've been saved so I can help them, the other wisps. I can't fight of course; I'll just help in my own way. Like, if I write down something helpful and leave it somewhere, another wisp might come along and get some use out of it! I could even try to get a bunch of wisps to try and chip in! Then everybody would be helping everyone else! If I make it out of this place, I'm going to make a difference, even if it's just one wisp at a time.\n
ARC_ARCHIVE_NOTE_TXT_0010	There's this really tall red structure the faeries call "Faerieland Tower." \n\nInside it's packed full of faeries and they're all searching for wisps. After they catch a wisp, they torment 'em for a while, then they make 'em disappear...none of the wisps ever come back. \n\nThey say they're using the wisps to collect their energy, or they're all feeding 'em to this really big monster...I've heard lots of different rumours. I'm not sure which are true, but either way it just means steer clear of there! A lot of faeries don't have very good eyesight, so if you find a good corner to curl up in you might be able to hide from them.\n\nDon't even think about putting up a fight - wisps can't beat faeries. We have to run. That's how we survive. If they still find some way to catch you...well, just say your prayers, I suppose. Who knows where the train'll take ya...
ARC_ARCHIVE_NOTE_TXT_0011	It looks like wisps who get caught near Forgotten Knoll get taken to Amadán's Big Top. That's a circus, but it's not a fun one. They specialise in acts that feature wisps as the “star attraction” - and I mean that in the worst way possible. Every wisp has had bad run-ins with faeries. But Amadán Dubh is something different. Have you ever heard what else they call him? "The Great Wisp Pulveriser" - and if you don't know what pulverise means, maybe you don't wanna. Cross him and it's lights out, trust me. They say underneath that circus tent is a whole score of devices all designed for maximum discomfort...I don't even wanna think about it. \n\nBut I've heard the circus also hides the entrance to a nature-filled paradise. Even if you do get caught, don't give up - just look for that way out. Wisps like us have to be tough, okay? Good luck!
ARC_ARCHIVE_NOTE_TXT_0012	If you're ever in the woods and you hear a loud roar, run and hide as fast as you can. It's probably the Jabberwock, a faerie dragon that's as strong as they come. To him, everything else is just food, no matter how big or small. Get caught and you'll be swallowed up in a single gulp. They say he used to be kept in a cage, but he got out somehow, and he's been causing a ruckus ever since. Even the other faeries can't control him. Worst of all, he has wings, meaning he can FLY. So it's really hard to hide from him - hiding behind something won't cut it. You've got to find a way so that you can't be seen from the sky. Wisps with something big sticking out of their head should be especially cautious. He typically dwells somewhere inside Windy Knot, so I'd stay away from there for starters, if you know what's good for you.\n
ARC_ARCHIVE_NOTE_TXT_0013	Have you ever spotted giant red wheels around the forest? They were made by the faeries a long time ago; they used wisps to turn them and generate energy. Supposedly they're called "turbines". And as of now, all most of them do is just spin. Because they're old! The devices they used to power have all fallen into disrepair or been reclaimed by the forest. Some of the forest animals put Avalon Drops inside them, so you might be able to get a little snack if you try. Then there are the ones that are still attached to big machines. These are the ones you need to be careful of. Once I just gave one a spin without much thought and the ground started moving right under me! I've seen a few turbines in the lake as well. They're hard to reach, but maybe a steady stream of water could get them turning. If you're curious, it's worth a try.
ARC_ARCHIVE_NOTE_TXT_0014	Ode to my lilyboat, first verse:\nOut on the lake with my lilyboat,\nThe stream carries us to and fro,\nA marvellous time on my lilyboat,\nOh where shall my lilyboat go?\n\nSecond verse:\nSailing Nimueh with my lilyboat,\nI've nary a guide but the wind,\nBut if I should fall in that whirlpool,\nThen there should my journey end!\n\nJust a little lyric I wrote out floating along the other day, you like it?\n\nI think it's got a certain charm to it...maybe I can try to invite some wisps out so we can all sing it while actually on a lilyboat...that could be fun! \n\nOn second thought, I'm not sure if everyone will want to sing on an unstable lily pad...maybe I'll just try to gather the wisps who like music in the hideaway and try to sing it there.
ARC_ARCHIVE_NOTE_TXT_0015	Any of you ever wonder why those faeries catch us in the first place? I asked old lady Ignis and she told me it's so they can drain our "negative vibes". Negative vibes are what wisps generate when they're scared, or sad, or angry even. Which means, we've gotta do our best to not be scared! Even if some real big faerie comes to get us. Don't let them intimidate you! If they come for you, the best strategy is always to hide in a dark spot. And if they try to draw you out with fire, just stay calm and douse it with some water! Gotta use everything you can if you're going to try and survive in this forest. You can use some vines to tangle 'em and buy some time, or maybe even distract them by starting a little fire of your own. Whatever you do, don't just stand there. They'll nab you in a heartbeat. Once they find you, if you're just a second too slow it might already be too late - keep moving, keep thinking, keep hiding!
ARC_ARCHIVE_NOTE_TXT_0016	Hey, have you heard some of the secrets of this forest?\n\nThere's a lot of amazing things the forest keeps tucked away.\n\nFor example, Vitality Petals - these are little petal shaped jewels that stick together after collecting a few of them! Once you've collected enough they disappear, but you feel tougher after they do for some reason. \n\nThen there's Magic Butterflies - named so because they look just like one, but they're actually a liquid. They've got a bitter taste, but they're pretty popular with a certain wisp crowd these days.\n\nAnd don't forget Crescent Clusters - these are crystals that you're usually not supposed to even find in Avalon - they're from Inferno or some place. Must be a lovely place to create such lovely objects. \n\nIt's such a large forest, there's still probably lots more I haven't even found yet. If anyone finds anything special, definitely share it with yours truly!
ARC_ARCHIVE_NOTE_TXT_0017	By glorious decree of our faerie king, many a moon have we spent studying the language of humans - the time to disclose these learnings is finally upon us! The majority of Avalon's faeries are untaught in the human tongue; fortuitous, for their ignorance shall act as a cloak ensuring the sanctity of these records.\n\nThe way of humans is disdainful, yes; yet still we reluctantly must admit that their wealth of knowings can be a considerable ally. By virtue of their scripts, we have taken their experiences and added them to our own fountain of wisdom. Surely all of Avalon would tremble now to see our mind's might! And they shall! They shall know our name before long...and we shall lead them to the light!\n\nAs of now, of the utmost importance is to study the intricacies of the "beach vacation": a tradition where the faeries of ancient times created illusionary shores of shining crystal sea...a most useful resource for recovering from the mental woes and drudgery of everyday forest life. Once complete, we shall present the tropical paradise to our great faerie king! (Not before, of course, we take due time to ascertain its salubrious properties for ourselves...)
ARC_ARCHIVE_NOTE_TXT_0018	The forest of Avalon has been protected by a great barrier since the times of yore. In the beginning, there were the sinful (seeking the forest for nothing but selfish desire, cursed be their name). In response, the faerie lords of the past banded together to drape the forest in an unseen wall of magic. Its existence has denied Avalon intruders ever since, allowing passage only to faeries and purehearted humans. As the hearts of humans grow twisted and corrupt with age, most who can enter are juveniles. \n\nOur recent calculations conclude the great barrier of Avalon is a rich source of magic that should not go untapped. By utilising the four Elemental Cores of Wood, Stone, Water and Fire, we could strengthen and reroute the great barrier for a new purpose. Specifically, the imprisonment of an insufferable being who would interfere with our glorious destiny. Yes, the use of power in this way may cause certain...distortions in the fabric of the forest, but 'tis a small price to pay for a plan of such monumental import!
ARC_ARCHIVE_NOTE_TXT_0019	At last, a fortress worthy of our infinite glory! The path has been long and fraught with some unfortunate obstructions, but nary a worry! Finally, we are master of our own domain, a king with a castle to call our own. Oh, the songs that will be sung chronicling this splendid day!\n\nNaturally, we have integrated technology of our own invention throughout the fortress. Compared to the trifling materials used in ancient faerie architecture, the fortress's red alloy will surely prove impregnable! (Furthermore, it should inspire horrible imaginings in any fool who dares stand before it in defiance!)\n\nAt the fortress's upper floors, tests are being done for my latest invention - the Tír na nÓg. We believe Tír na nÓgs will become an invaluable cornerstone for swooping up the energy from humans and wisps we so do require. After tests are concluded here, we shall expand Tír na nÓgs to cover all of Avalon...nay, the world! (For those inquiring of the name Tír na nÓg, we have coined this moniker from texts that serve as the basis for our faerie utopia...which, with the power of the Tír na nÓg, may well be within our grasp!)
ARC_ARCHIVE_NOTE_TXT_0020	We have discovered the energy source required for the Tír na nÓgs is far greater than previously expected. Even the extra power we have amassed from siphoning the four elements of the forest and channelling them through the Elemental Cores is proving to be insufficient. \n\nTo offset this, we have devised two plans. The first of these is an increased effort in drawing out the negative vibes of wisps - human souls - for energy. It is the nature of Avalon to take the spirits of humans who perish within its hallowed ground and transmogrify them into wisps, in which form they may (possibly) exist eternally. And the negative vibes that emanate from tormenting these pathetic beings is as delicious as it is useful - and should thus be used without remorse!\n\nPlan number two is the production of a device to further amplify the power we have snatched up. The principles for this device come from the human-made "gear". But what we have devised for our fortress makes any clockwork made by the hands of man seem like child's play. The beauty of these machines is that even a small source of power should be able to be amplified into something far greater. (The one unfortunate downside is the complexity of these devices makes them more fragile than even the human psyche; susceptible to malfunction or breakdown if misused...even slightly).
ARC_ARCHIVE_NOTE_TXT_0021	To keep our kingdom the epitome of efficiency and efficacy, having those who serve us know their standing is of principle importance. That is why, after long digression, we have decided that from this day forward, our faerie kingdom will employ a benevolent hierarchy for all of its citizens. The virtues of such a system are twofold: to imbue pride in one's current post, and to incentivise rising up to the ranks of others. We believe the roles of a kingdom can be best exemplified through the game of chess; we will use this, along with a jewel, taken from the faerie's natural colour. The innate aptitude of a faerie can largely be determined from their birth, by their colour. It is for this reason that most faeries take pride in the colour they bear. To not integrate this into the hierarchy would be a most foolish mistake. \n\nAs for ourselves, our jewel will be Amethyst, making me the Amethyst King...Amethyst King...? What a sweet ring to our ears! How pleasant to see it etched in ink! \n\nIndeed, sharing this joy with the other faeries of Avalon must now be our first priority, for we are sure they will be pleased with their titles as well. Yet another wise decision that further solidifies the magnificence of my grandiose monarchy! All hail the Amethyst King!
ARC_ARCHIVE_NOTE_TXT_0022	Word has arrived that the Jabberwock, a war-time ally and once trusted confidant, has extricated himself from his cage somehow. Few know the bounds of dear Jabbie's might - he has given assistance even to the great Moltred during the feudal times of Avalon. His appetite has claimed many a faerie. He has absolute confidence in his combat prowess, as do we. After being sealed away by that dastardly former faerie king, we were so kind as to liberate him and recruit him to our army post-haste. Despite that, the cursed beast refused to listen to a single order and just thrashed about to his own pleasing! Unstoppable even by our own hand, he continued snacking on our higher-ranking officers until we locked him in a cage and tossed it out around Wyvern Falls. \n\nIf his escape is more than mere rumour...it is quite an unpleasant turn of events. Still, unless one wanders haphazardly near his dwelling there is little to fear. And if he desires to feast of an odd faerie pawn time and again, we say so be it! It is of no matter to us! As long as we can assure our own safety there, 'tis nary a trouble at all. That is...other than the Elemental Core of Water. Well, when we have business with it, we suppose we will just need to exercise extra caution. Other than that, bothersome situations are best handled with the policy (to use the human proverb): \n“out of sight, out of mind.”
ARC_ARCHIVE_NOTE_TXT_0023	Being a ruler, in short summary, is to decide what stays, and what must go. To take all the spoils never is an option, we lament. One would surely weigh themselves down with that which should be omitted. One should never hesitate to execute a healthy purge in their kingdom to make "out with the old and in with the new". And as the one eternal, infinite ruler of Avalon, we hereby proclaim the inconsequentials of this kingdom to be:\n\n1. Devices we have created that have sadly broken down\n2. Wisps who have been drained of their energy-generating vibes\n3. Eyesores bearing ancient regalia\n4. Incompetent, stupid faeries\n\nIf unnecessary for our kingdom, we wish they be promptly removed from our sight. We have decreed that the Faerieland Tower vicinity shall be the proper place for the expulsion of this detritus.\n\nWe shall extend a proclamation to our kingdom that this waste must be disposed of with utmost haste. Repeated excursions to and from the site, however, seems an unconscionable bore. Therefore, we have ordered the construction of a giant slide that feeds directly to the disposal area, so faeries may toss these unwanted articles straight down the slide, gone in an instant. Could this be our most ingenious idea to date? We shall make the arrangements to see that it is exacted immediately!
ARC_ARCHIVE_NOTE_TXT_0024	Amadán Dubh, a more than adequately reliable faerie to whom we bestowed the title Amber Jester, possesses a set of exemplary abilities. Beginning his studies of the circus arts during the reign of the former king, he pursued his ambitions and established Amadán's Big Top, right here in Avalon, making a name for himself with a fine selection of performances centred around the hoisting of wisps. \n\nHis devotion to his craft is absolute, continually pushing himself to achieve new heights of wisp agony. As one dedicated to research of our own, we feel him our kin. Perhaps this is why we find his shows to be such excellent entertainment, and have been known to take one of the box seats from time to time.\n\nHis knack for tormenting wisps is of a level not commonly seen in the faerie world, and we must say he served Avalon well during his time as overseer of Faerieland Tower. Even since leaving his post, the faeries he trained to take over have done his name proud.\n\nWe wish nothing but prosperity for his circus troupe and pray it may serve to further enrich the culture of our fine kingdom! A cheer for Amadán Dubh!
ARC_ARCHIVE_NOTE_TXT_0025	For too long now, Avalon has known nothing but endless suffering, night and day. Everywhere you go, it is survival of the fittest, with the weak facing constant persecution. But now, I finally feel a ray of hope has arrived.\n\nOh, I have waited for this moment for such a long time. Waiting for someone able to put an end to the faeries' treacherous ways and return the forest to the peaceful land it was always meant to be.\n\nThere was a time I may have been able to stand against the faeries myself, but regrettably, that power has long since left me. If only I could do something to rekindle it, to regain my previous strength...oh, how I shed many a tear cursing how feeble I have become! But now, I see that it does not have to be my doing. Justice shall be delivered without my intervention. Yes...a hero shall come to restore balance; such is the way of light and darkness in this world.\n\nI believe the fate of Avalon rests on that young, bright-eyed witch...and the strength of the bond between her and her companion. I sense they may have what it takes to stop the wrongdoings in this forest. May the blessing of Avalon be upon them...
ARC_ARCHIVE_NOTE_TXT_0026	Time and time again, new souls from the outside world somehow find their way to Avalon. The barrier cast on the forest makes it so that usually they are innocent children. \n\nCuriously, a decent number who come through are young witches of the Umbran clan. Despite their youth, are they able to sense what hides in the shadowy depth of the forest? Or perhaps they simply come in search of power, drawn by the wondrous natural energy flowing through Avalon.\n\nWhatever the case may be, despite minor differences in skill, every girl who has entered the forest clearly seems to still be in training. However, it is this naïve courage against overwhelming odds that gives each of them their own unique lustre - watching the youthful energy they radiate breathes new life into a heart I had thought long rusted and cold. \n\nIn my journals, I'd like to share the tales of these girls, lest their memories be forgotten.
ARC_ARCHIVE_NOTE_TXT_0027	The dreadful clown is turning out to be quite the formidable foe.\n\nHis malicious wisp tricks have resulted in some of the largest accumulations of negative vibes in faerie history, catapulting him to the top of the faerie hierarchy. It's striking to think that he used to be a faerie no bigger than the rest of them! \n\nHis story, I fear, is of one being driven mad by power they cannot contain. Once the general overseer of Faerieland Tower, he carried a modest reputation for being an efficient wisp tormentor. Now, he just holes up in his tent all day, working on his little circus show. I was certain his madness would eat away at him until his eventual demise, but he seems to have a very keen sense of self-preservation. There was a young witch who went to face off against him in his tent...he made short work of her. The girl must have underestimated him based on his foolish appearance and challenged him to a ball-balance duel. An unfortunate mistake. He has trained for years and years on that ball of his - every movement practised to perfection. Within an instant, the poor witch was flattened like a pancake. It just goes to show, challenging your opponent on their home court is never a wise strategy.
ARC_ARCHIVE_NOTE_TXT_0028	The Jabberwock of Wyvern Falls has been the scourge of this forest ever since the ancient days of yore. Anything that moves is his target: humans, wisps, faeries...he will strike anything without hesitation or remorse. His violent disposition is enough that even I am hesitant to approach.\n\nOnce, there was a brave young witch who attempted to rid Avalon of this pestilence. She scoured the forest looking for anything to be of assistance, until coming across some trees that bore explosive fruit.\n\nConfident she had found the key to victory, she waited for an opening, then gave the bombastic fruit a mighty toss right into the dragon's mouth. \n\nSadly, the smoke cleared to reveal the Jabberwock had not suffered so much as a scratch. The young witch stood in shock, and before I could try and help, the beast had gobbled her up whole. \n\nSince then, the vile creature has even taken a liking to the fruits, eating a dozen or so at a time for a snack. I do think I'll enjoy the day someone finally takes care of that despicable dragon.
ARC_ARCHIVE_NOTE_TXT_0029	Near Púca's Fortress, there is a frozen cavern that could only be the product of one with a heart as wicked as his. Once, it was said to be a mystical cave full of dragon's gold and twinkling fireflies. But his reckless use of the Elemental Core to power his fortress drained the energy from the surrounding areas, turning them to a blasted heath. Plants rotted to ash, the animals fled, and the caves became a frozen wasteland in a matter of months.\n\nSeeing Púca carry out his schemes truly makes my heart ache. He seems bent on undoing the works of the previous faerie king and returning Avalon to a land of absolute authority.\n\nSadly, he has amassed enough power to make his terrible ambitions a reality.\n\nMany of the faeries are under his control and there are even angels who seem to do his bidding. It's true what they say: history repeats itself. I only hope someone will rise to stop him...
ARC_ARCHIVE_NOTE_TXT_0030	The sinister structure of rusted red in Ashenbark Woods continues to grow in size at an alarming rate. An army of faeries is stationed around the structure's premises, and flames burst forth from its every orifice. A single misstep and any poor soul would be incinerated. The primary objective of this never-ending construction must be to keep intruders away from what lies within, but I conjecture there's more to it than just that. Faeries feed on the negative vibes of humans and wisps...so what better than to create a towering symbol of absolute dread to keep their prey in constant terror? The more ominous and grandiose it becomes, surely the richer and more plentiful the negative vibes it will produce.\n\nI think you could also say it exists to assist the faeries' domination of Avalon. \n\nOnce, there was a young witch who challenged the dreaded fortress. Lamentably, her efforts proved to be in vain; the fortress's exterior was too hard to crack. Still, the faeries were absolutely relentless in their retaliation on this poor girl, following her to the ends of the forest to make sure she was eradicated completely. The terrible fortress is truly a reflection of the cruel hands which built it.
ARC_ARCHIVE_NOTE_TXT_0031	In a way, Avalon is a naturally formed labyrinth, growing increasingly complex as time passes. Even for someone who claims to have learnt the forest's inner workings, keeping track of its constant changes can prove overwhelming. Much of this has to do with the ever-evolving nature of the forest's biology, but the impact the faeries bring with their continuous building does not make my task any easier.\n\nI'm sure if I took my eyes off the forest for an instant, it would transform into something else completely.\n\nAs such, it's easy to imagine how some of the young witches who have wandered into Avalon can quickly lose their way. One such witch spent hours circling the same path endlessly, until she resolved to plunge right into a pile of bushes. And what would you know, it ended up being a secret passageway that not even I was aware of. Perhaps it is best not to underestimate the inner compass of the Umbra. Or so I would say, if it had not led her straight into a faerie trap. She was never heard of again. It just goes to show, sometimes it is crucial to look before you leap.
ARC_ARCHIVE_NOTE_TXT_0032	As I watch Colm and the other wisps of the hideaway, I realise the necessity of bonds and belonging - something I admit I may have been neglecting. \n\nThey remind me of two young witches who came to this forest long ago. They were twins who seemed to have an almost inseparable bond. Together, they were able to overcome countless obstacles in the forest. I hoped they might be the saving grace that Avalon so desperately needs.\n\nBut one day, the two fell into an argument they could not resolve. They came across a powerful enemy and debated how to proceed. The prideful older sister insisted they must fight, while the younger felt fleeing was the only way to stay alive. Ultimately unable to agree, the two went their separate ways. They both regretted what they had done, but it was too late, and they were both found defeated. Those two girls were special to me...I still have bad dreams about not being able to save them. \n\nThis forest is full of faerie deception - nothing is more essential than having someone to rely on, and yet at times, nothing can be more difficult. The older I become, the heavier my sorrows weigh. But I am not ready to give up yet. I vow to do what I can for others, for my own sake, as well as theirs.
ARC_ARCHIVE_NOTE_TXT_0033	Avalon Forest is considered to be an ethereal world dense with nature's greatest secrets. Since long ago, this land has been home to the enigmatic faeries and their monarch, the faerie king. Surrounded by a magical force which only permits the purest of souls entry, it is ultimately the faeries which give it life. \n\nBy some twist of fate, I was allowed passage into this enchanting world, and I plan to use this chance to unravel this forest's many mysteries. \n\nWe illuminate the past to reflect on it, and take record of the past to enlighten others. I pray that my findings may be instrumental to a long-awaited reconciliation between the faeries and humankind. \n\nThe history of the faerie kingdom begins in the feudal times of Avalon, where splintered nations overseen by different faerie lords were in a constant struggle for power. For eons, these nations would crumble and rebuild, unite and divide. In their feudal state, none of the nations would prove particularly long-lasting, and most were ultimately relegated to the annals of history as this era reached its end.
ARC_ARCHIVE_NOTE_TXT_0034	The feudal era between the faerie nations officially came to a close by the hand of a faerie known as Moltred. Both a skilled strategist and fearless warrior with a flaming spear, his fighting earned numerous accolades and brought his home nation to prosperity. Stories of his strength spread through the forest, and many of Avalon's most talented fighters gathered before him. With his unrelenting ambition and military prowess, he conquered the surrounding faerie nations, one after another, until he had finally succeeded in overcoming all of Avalon. \n\nMoltred's unification of Avalon, however, ushered in an era that was as heated as the surface of the sun. After his conquest was finished, there was not a single soul left with the power to oppose the new faerie king. Gaining absolute authority, his hubris grew, and his already tumultuous pride began to misshape him, slowly but surely.
ARC_ARCHIVE_NOTE_TXT_0035	Moltred was twisted by his obsession with complete domination of Avalon, going after wisps, humans, animals, even lesser faeries - and stealing their souls. When ascending to the throne, the most powerful faeries in Avalon had already shifted to his side, so at this point no one remained to oppose him. In but a few years' time, Avalon had transformed into a prison of torment where the weak lived in constant fear. Moltred and his generals showed no signs of slowing down, their iron grip on Avalon absolute.\n\nWith the forest's balance spiralling out of control, it seemed as if this would be Avalon's fall. Then, out of the blue, the seemingly impossible occurred. A young faerie decided to take a stand, becoming a ray of hope to those in the forest who had lost their light. His name was Arthur. Growing up along the shores of Lake Nimueh, he had a deep sense of caring for all the forest's creatures. Deciding it was time to bring peace back to the forest, he raised a call to arms against Moltred.\n
ARC_ARCHIVE_NOTE_TXT_0036	Arthur was a pacifist by nature who disliked fighting and bloodshed. Though he was born with superb natural gifts, he knew his skills alone would never stand a chance against Moltred. The first thing he set out to do was find the legendary sword said to sleep somewhere deep within Lake Nimueh. Journeying around the lake's inlets on his trusty lilyboat, he eventually found the divine blade, nearby the place of his own birth. The second he lay hands on the sword's hilt, a goddess emerged from beneath the lake. She spoke unto him, saying "Take the sword...may its blade cut open a new future for Avalon." With new resolve, Arthur took the sword and sheathed it to his waist. Word that someone had finally removed the sword from its resting place spread through the forest overnight. Knowing of his kind nature, many like-minded faeries came to his side to join him. Arthur held his sword high, proclaiming war against Moltred. And with this one grand gesture, the battle to reclaim Avalon had officially begun.
ARC_ARCHIVE_NOTE_TXT_0037	Arthur and his group of revolutionaries began tactical sieges throughout the forest. At first, Moltred underestimated Arthur's forces, casually ordering his troops to put down what he assumed to be a doomed rebellion. This overconfidence would eventually backfire as one by one Arthur defeated Moltred's generals. The earth titan, Gunzelhark. Odradine, ruler of the waterways. And Fovylhund, the fervid devil. Gaining courage with each victory, Arthur decided next to make his way to Windy Knot and challenge the Jabberwock, the great faerie dragon and loyal pet to Moltred. At first, things did not bode well for the revolution. The Jabberwock's hardened scales proved impervious to all attacks, and his screeching roar alone was enough to bring an average faerie to their knees. Even with the victories the revolution had enjoyed thus far, defeating the Jabberwock seemed impossible as more and more of Arthur's allies became snacks for the mighty dragon.
ARC_ARCHIVE_NOTE_TXT_0038	Arthur shed a tear for his fallen comrades, then set his gaze back on the foe before him: the mighty Jabberwock. He realised the dragon was too powerful to be defeated by any usual method. The beast gave him but a split-second opening, but it was all he needed. Casting a powerful spell he sealed the draconic faerie in a crystal tomb. \n\nThough the revolution's sacrifices were great, thanks to Arthur's efforts, they succeeded in immobilising the Jabberwock, stopping his reign of terror.\n\nThe band of rebels pushed on, their victories growing by the day. Slowly, Moltred was being drawn into a corner; by this time, his numbers had been reduced substantially, and Arthur's revolutionary army had outgrown his own. He decided it was time to take to the front lines himself.\n\nDespite losing ground, Moltred alone had strength that could easily match Arthur's army. Deciding he could not increase casualties further, Arthur challenged Moltred to a one-on-one duel at Chalkroot Hollow.\n\nThe fateful battle was about to begin.
ARC_ARCHIVE_NOTE_TXT_0039	Acknowledging Arthur's strength, King Moltred accepted the duel. Arthur had barely time to blink before the warrior king was upon him. Eyes wild with laughter, his trusted Infernus Pike blazed brighter than ever. Arthur unsheathed his blade to meet Moltred head on, but he had moved a fraction of a second too late. Moltred's lance sank deep into Arthur's side, searing him from the inside. The moment seemed frozen in time. The whole forest looked on with desperation, their hopes on the verge of shattering. Just then, rain poured forth from the heavens, so heavy it was as if Lake Nimueh had been emptied from the sky. For a moment, Moltred's flames were extinguished. Arthur seized the opportunity and plunged his sword straight into Moltred's ashen-black heart. Eyes wide in disbelief, Moltred's body lit up an incandescent red, expanded like a balloon, until finally bursting into pieces, which scattered to the wind. The Crimson King had been defeated. Arthur was victorious. His coronation was unanimously approved by all of Avalon. Long ravaged by war, the forest was finally at peace.
ARC_ARCHIVE_NOTE_TXT_0040	Arthur's first order as the new king was to foster a philosophy of modest living and nurture a civilisation where all the forest's residents could share in its abundance equally. He worked to improve relations with both humans and wisps, who had been subjugated by the faeries for generations. Arthur even allowed a few promising young faeries to learn the language and culture of humans.\n\nThe days of feudal Avalon are now a thing of the past. The denizens of the forest now live in peace with one another under the rule of their great king. Still, Arthur's ideals are myriad, and he will require the cooperation of many to see them accomplished.\n\nOh, how I hope that we might finally be able to free this land from its war and suffering. I wish to show its residents the beauty that can be found from seeking harmony with all living creatures.\n\nMy dear son Lukaon, I can only hope that by the time you have grown, the misguided walls drawn to divide faerie and human have all crumbled to dust. \n\nWith that wish, I close this chapter of Avalon's history, and look towards its bright future.\n
ARC_ARCHIVE_NOTE_TXT_0041	"You are forbidden to enter that forest!" ...yeah, yeah, I know. But sometimes you've got to do what you've got to do. Besides, I'm already inside anyway, so no turning back now! I'm going to do what I came here for.\n\nI suppose I may have rushed into things just a little bit...\n\nI probably should've brought some more food and a few more essentials, but...I can't start getting down on myself already. I'm from a long line of powerful witches...I'll be okay! I need to have more confidence in myself. \n\nThe first thing I realised as I started exploring the forest is the importance of a place I can set up base and recuperate. You never know what will be waiting around the corner here, so I need to stay well-rested and alert. Fortunately, there's plenty of wood around to build with, and even this weird red metal too. If I put a little bit of time into it, I'm sure I can make a simple camping spot to hold me over for a while. Oh, I should probably find a cauldron for some concocting too...\n
ARC_ARCHIVE_NOTE_TXT_0042	In Avalon, no matter where you go faeries are running the show. Those creepy pockets of fog here and there seem to be their work too. I think being in it makes them stronger too, because I tried giving one a good wallop with a stick when I was in there and they didn't even flinch...That doesn't mean it got the best of me, though. Hey, I'm an Umbra Witch after all! I used my magic to shine some light, and the faerie seemed to get scared and ran off. \n\nTo be honest, it was dark and I was just trying to light up a path to see where I was going, but all's well that ends well! Now I know their weakness. \n\nI think I figured out how the fog works too. Inside, I found a spot that looked like a big crack in the air itself...The fog was pouring out of that crack, no mistake. I'm sure if you checked out what's beyond that crack, you'd find what's causing this fog in the first place. Not that I'm about to test that theory myself...(I'm not THAT brave).
ARC_ARCHIVE_NOTE_TXT_0043	Those faeries can be pretty clever...they got a few good hits in on me. I mean, there's so many of them it's hardly fair! (They should be called Unfaeries, am I right?) Maybe it wasn't a good idea for me to head into this forest...no, I can't doubt myself. If I'm going to be a witch, I can't give up!\n\nI should get back to my camp so I can concoct something to take care of these wounds. We witches have a whole bag of tricks to work with...no need to worry when I've got pockets full of concocting ingredients!\n\nI should probably write down a few of these recipes I keep forgetting. Healing Tonic...that's a little Mandragora Root and some Baked Gecko. And probably what I need most right now. Then there's Umbran Syrup...that one's made with root and newt too, and a dash of Unicorn Horn, but it uses a lot more Mandragora than the tonic...You get a couple mouthfuls of that down and you're able to cast spells nonstop! \n\nI'm sure I've made more than that but...ah, I should have paid more attention to my master! I'll just have to write them down when I remember them...
ARC_ARCHIVE_NOTE_TXT_0044	This forest has a lot more Infernal plants than I expected...is Avalon close to Inferno or something? Most of them are all droopy at first, but just sprinkle a little magic and they shoot up in no time! Doing so has opened up a few different paths in the forest, so I'm trying it out wherever I can. I'm also not an expert on exactly which plants are infernal, so I kind of just try some magic on whatever suspicious-looking plants I come across.\n\nSpeaking of infernal plants, I found this giant fruit near here that I'd only seen in books before. It was called "Inferno Fruit" and the sweet scent alone hit me like a ton of bricks. I was hungry so I tried taking a bite, but it was way too sweet for a human tongue, practically inedible. Still, it did really energise me, so it must have some pretty strong magical properties. If only it wasn't so bloody sugary, I'd probably have taken some with me.
ARC_ARCHIVE_NOTE_TXT_0045	I met a wisp who told me a little bit about this area. It seems to be called Faerieland Tower and it's a hub for the faeries to send captured wisps off to every corner of the forest. There are hordes of faeries on guard; it must double as their base of operations. I tried to sneak a little look, and just like the wisp said, there were many poor souls inside being tormented by the faeries. I'd heard that faeries drain the life energy out of humans, but it looks like it doesn't stop there. After they've sapped your corporeal body dry, your spirit becomes a wisp that they torment to generate even more energy, until you are well and truly spent.\n\nI wish I could do something about these horrible deeds, but that's not what I'm here for. I need to stay focused on my mission. The leader of Faerieland Tower is a circus jester named Amada...something. Knowing the sinister purpose of the contraptions strewn about his circus gives the entire place a terribly creepy air. Or, perhaps it's the other way round. Maybe the whole circus was designed that way on purpose to strike fear into human hearts...the show has begun before we even set foot in that dastard's circus ring!
ARC_ARCHIVE_NOTE_TXT_0046	Me and my sister are twins - Prima (her)/Plima (me). Like you'd expect, we look alike, we're the same height, but the other day I realised something that took me by surprise. Prima is actually a bit heavier than me...and by a bit, I mean a lot. It happened when we split up while we were looking around inside the circus. All of a sudden, something sent me catapulting into the air! I noticed the ground we were standing on was able to tilt like a see-saw, and my sister was standing directly opposite me on the other end. You don't need to be a mathematician to understand what it must mean that she sent me flying. \n\nThinking back, I caught a quick glimpse of something during that jump...if only I could get a better look...Maybe if Prima would try stomping the ground really hard she could get me up even higher. I think it's worth checking out...I'm just not sure how to bring it up. She'd probably deny everything if I told her. Ah! That's her coming ri-
ARC_ARCHIVE_NOTE_TXT_0047	We finally made it to the faeries' fortress...and it is something to behold!\n\nThis has to be where they're doing all their scheming. Pipes full of who-knows-what shooting every which way, bright blue flames, and complex machinery unlike anything I've ever seen...what could they possibly be doing with all of this? Beats me, but that's beside the point. We're here for one thing - to wipe up these wicked faeries and destroy that Elemental Core! This place is absolutely crawling with faeries, but me and Plima should be okay as long as we're together. The main problem at the moment is...we're stuck. We know the Elemental Core is up there somewhere, but we have no idea how we're going to reach it. The walls are impossible to climb. I thought about asking Plima if she'd let me stand on her shoulders again, but she got really whiny the last time we tried that...I wonder what that was about. I weigh less than her! ...I think.\n\nWell, since we're witches, I suppose we should try using magic? That faerie contraption over there looks like it might do something...
ARC_ARCHIVE_NOTE_TXT_0048	The faeries have this leader they call the faerie king; I'd watch out for him if I were you. It was too dark for me to see clearly, but it looked like he summoned this monster that was absolutely enormous! If he has the power to summon something like that, there's no way we can beat him. I know we had a reason for coming to this forest. But if we die along the way, it'll all be for nothing! We have to run...we can't fight him as we are now. \n\nPrima wouldn't listen at all...she says we'll be fine, that we have to stand our ground. I got so angry that she wouldn't listen...If she's going to be like that, I told her to just go off and fight by herself. But...now I'm worried about her. She's the only sister I've got. Ever since we were taken in, it's always just been the two of us...I thought we could get through anything together.\n\n...I'm going to go find her and apologise.

ARC_ARCHIVE_HITODAMA_TXT_0001	Height: Regular-sized house plant\nWeight: Small clump of moss\nPersonality: Carefree\nHobby: Sunbathing\n\nMossy has a reputation for taking things slow, even for a wisp. The large part of his day is spent sunbathing, and he lays so perfectly still that the grass tends to grow straight over him. \n\nBut that doesn't bother ol' Mossy at all. Nothing makes him happier than a good nap in a soft blanket of sunlight. One would think that lying out in the open would make him an easy faerie target, but he blends in with the surrounding shrubbery so much the faeries don't seem to notice him much anyway.\n\nThe other wisps find his bright outlook and laid back disposition to be a breath of fresh air, and sometimes wisps will congregate together to sprawl out with him. Woe be the wisp that would unsuspectingly take one of Mossy's favourite sunbathing spots, though - the calm-natured wisp will blow up like a cannon.
ARC_ARCHIVE_HITODAMA_TXT_0002	Height: Approx. 8 nails\nWeight: A standard hammer\nPersonality: Stubborn\nHobby: Studying\n\nThere's a rumour in Avalon that the nail in Nail's head is bent that way because they couldn't get it through his stubborn head.\n\nCompletely by-the-book, everything about him is straight and narrow (except the nail of course). He shows no mercy to rulebreakers, be they friend or foe, so most of the other wisps see him as the local enforcer of law and order. \n\nIn his younger days, he was quite studious, and his academic scores were nothing to sneeze at. But he rebelled against the future his parents wanted for him and ran away to Avalon. This would lead to his capture by the faeries and his turning into a wisp. Regretting his actions, he now has a remorseful determination towards the importance of abiding to the conventions created by others.
ARC_ARCHIVE_HITODAMA_TXT_0003	Height: Just over 4 large cogs\nWeight : 3.5 small cogs\nPersonality: Sarcastic\nHobby: Musical performance\n\nMetalhead is known as the sarcastic wisp. He's always looking at things a bit slanted, always smugly sure there's something more to it that everyone else can't see. Despite all of that, music is like a doorway to his soul. It's nigh impossible to find an instrument dropped in the forest, so he resorts to collecting twigs and other materials to make his own. As a craftsman, he accepts nothing short of perfection; each of his creations is a masterpiece of musical beauty. His playing skills, on the other hand...leave something to be desired. He is known to often break out into pure unmelodious cacophony, but he just looks so happy...no one has the heart to stop him.
ARC_ARCHIVE_HITODAMA_TXT_0004	Height: 3 head bolts\nWeight: Medium wrench\nPersonality: Two-faced\nHobby: Mountain climbing\n\nHolt is a very different wisp depending on who he's with. \n\nThose close to him and anyone he considers "below" him, he can be very direct and assertive with. But put him in front of a stranger, or anyone he thinks is "important" and you can't get a whole sentence out of him.\n\nThis two-faced personality is pretty infamous among the wisps, but Holt himself seems curiously unaware. According to Holt, to be a good mountain climber (Holt's favourite hobby) you need a good grasp of what's below you, and what's above you. This ideology just kind of seeps into his everyday personality, you could say. Holt also happens to be notorious at getting lost - they say even in his previous life, he didn't have a lot of luck ever making it to the top. He's been trying to recruit a few wisps to his newly coined "Holt's Trailblazers"...but hasn't had any luck so far.
ARC_ARCHIVE_HITODAMA_TXT_0005	Height: Dashingly tall\nWeight: Some roses and chocolates\nPersonality: Narcissist\nHobby: Self-gazing\n\n"Love thyself and others shall surely love you too": this is the core of Rattles's philosophy. Everything that comes from his mouth is usually sweet nonsense, but he does have a certain charm that the other wisps can't put their finger on. Perhaps that's why no one has that much bad to say about him. Which makes sense, because when everyone isn't looking, Rattles puts a lot of effort into trying to make himself shine. He watches his diet to be sure his spectral aura glows brilliantly, and he polishes his chains so they're always squeaky clean. He's even been doing a little weight-training in case a poor wisp in distress comes along in need of rescuing. \n\nOf course, he would die before he let any of the other wisps discover his painstaking efforts. To be loved, his greatness must seem effortless.
ARC_ARCHIVE_HITODAMA_TXT_0006	Height: 40 marking pins\nWeight: 3 sewing needles\nPersonality: Fussy\nHobby: Cross-stitch\n\nPinpoint is the go-to gal for all the clothing needs of Avalon's wisps. The faeries may have originally bagged the wisps with their hoods, but someone needs to do upkeep or they'll get ragged and torn. Pinpoint uses supplies collected by other wisps in the forest to do alterations that make sure every hood is well maintained. No wisp can deny she does skilled work, but she's so fussy about every detail that even the smallest job takes forever. All of her needles need to be of a certain sharpness and shine. Make one mistake in the pattern and she'll unravel the whole hood and start over again. This means at any given time there are a long line of wisps waiting for her repairs. Some wisps go so far as to try and hide little rips in their hoods just to avoid getting involved in the whole process.
ARC_ARCHIVE_HITODAMA_TXT_0007	Height: A normal hammer\nWeight: A few hammers\nPersonality: Troublemaker\nHobby: Camping\n\nThe perfect word for Plop is probably "rascal" - he runs around the forest causing mischief every day with what seems like an endless reserve of energy.\n\nThe hammer stuck on his head doubles as a tool for his tricks, especially to bop other wisps with.\n\nThese antics constantly get him in trouble, but Plop never seems to mind - come tomorrow he'll be waving his hammer-head at someone all over again. Maybe it's because he became a wisp at a young age and he never got the chance to grow up. \n\nPlop is an avid lover of nature, so Avalon might be the perfect place for him - it certainly gives him plenty of time for camping, his favourite hobby. The fact that he seems so well adjusted to his life in Avalon is something that a few of the other wisps secretly find somewhat vexing. 
ARC_ARCHIVE_HITODAMA_TXT_0008	Height: About a bow\nWeight: About one arrow\nPersonality: Quick-tempered\nHobby: Hunting\n\nRobin was a hunter as brave as they come. He had struck down many a beast with his trusty bow and arrow. He had confidence in his skill and believed there was no prey he could not fell.\n\nBeing a heroic lad, he set his sights on the faeries of Avalon, who were rumoured to be whisking away many a child. Sadly, this is where fate turned against him. His bow and arrow proved worthless against the faeries, and the hunter became the hunted. But even after his attacks proved worthless, Robin's sense of honour would never allow him to turn his back and run. He still hopes to get back at the faeries, though now it has perhaps become more personal. He likes to think of the arrows stuck in his head as a constant reminder the enemy is still out there.\n\nRecently, he has been poaching small animals around the forest, testing his skills, hoping for a rematch someday.
ARC_ARCHIVE_HITODAMA_TXT_0009	Height: Movie star tall\nWeight: Shame on you\nPersonality: Haughty\nHobby: Shopping\n\nKingsley considers herself something of an actress. She claims she definitely has the face of one, though no one's ever seen under her hood. One of her favourite things to say is, "My looks could drive even a faerie wild, darling." Sadly, these same faeries don't seem to have much interest in her after she became a wisp. \n\nShe acts like royalty and demands to be treated as such. She finds living in a place without a single jewellery store to be absolutely dreadful, but she makes the best of her time in Avalon by having servant wisps go find valuable-looking stones and the like for her.\n\nWhy these wisps listen to her is anyone's guess, but perhaps they hope their loyalty may one day earn them just a glance under the hood - something which, again, has never been achieved.
ARC_ARCHIVE_HITODAMA_TXT_0010	Height: About as tall as two paintbrushes\nWeight: Momma's apple pie\nPersonality: Easy-going\nHobby: Painting\n\nCandy was originally a boy who loved art.\n\nHe would often be moved by the things he would see, lock them into memory, and give them new life on the canvas. After finishing a painting, his mother would always be waiting with words of encouragement and a delicious apple pie. \n\nOne day, he wandered to Avalon Forest in search of inspiration and never made it back. After being made a wisp, he realised he could no longer see. Still, he has never let his circumstance change his passion for painting. Though he now only sees a flood of red, he is still able to conjure up vistas from yesteryear, and thinks up new grand worlds as well. He makes his drawings on faerie flyers that other wisps collect for him. \n\nHe may never be able to lay eyes on his own work again, but it is still enjoyed by many of the other wisps. And that's good enough for him - that's good enough to keep him going.\n\nHe'd be able to see fine if he just took the nails out, but...he may never figure that out.
ARC_ARCHIVE_HITODAMA_TXT_0011	Height: 6 pairs of glasses\nWeight: 1 lens\nPersonality: Innocent\nHobby: Exploring, singing\n\nDouble-O is an innocent young boy. He loves to explore and he loves to sing, so he's often humming around the hideaway in search of secrets. His definition of "exploring" can be summarised as sniffing out various junk on the ground, but he's quite serious about inspecting said junk. He proclaims one of his discoveries will prove of legendary importance to the wisps someday, so he puts his all into his excursions. \n\nThe glasses he wears aren't prescription, they're just another of his findings. He believes them to be a good luck charm for his treasure hunts. The melody of "The Great Wisp Explorers", a little tune he made for his searches, is fairly catchy, and often hummed unconsciously by other wisps in the hideaway.
ARC_ARCHIVE_HITODAMA_TXT_0012	Height: 4 boxes\nWeight: 2 boxes\nPersonality: Loner\nHobby: Hide 'n seek\n\nBoxby is...a wisp with a box on his head. His shyness is so severe that the box serves as an essential comfort - sheltering him from the unknowns of the outside world. He would never dream of taking it off. \n\nThe box has been with him for a long time, and is starting to accumulate a decent amount of holes and tape. It was given to him by another wisp he met in the forest long ago, and he'd never think to replace it.\n\nAs part of his reclusive personality, his hide 'n seek skills are second to none. When really trying, it could take days to find him. That is, if it weren't for the box, which is kind of a dead give away. So ultimately, he's probably just as easy to find as anyone.
ARC_ARCHIVE_HITODAMA_TXT_0013	Height: Grandiose\nWeight: Supreme\nPersonality: Doubting\nHobby: Poems, singing\n\nFlick is a wisp off in his own world. He believes himself to be of an alternate, greater dimension, and he behaves very strangely doing what he calls "rituals". Sometimes he goes off by himself chanting the same hymn for hours at a time. \n\nThis curious behaviour started with a betrayal by one of his closest wisp friends. Ever since, his mannerisms have served as a defence mechanism to distance himself from the other wisps of Avalon. \n\nDeep down though, he's much more straightforward than he would ever let on. The poems he writes are simple and easy to understand, and pure. He has a beautiful voice that some wisps secretly try to listen in on when he sings. Ever since coming to the hideaway, he has been surrounded by a warm bunch of wisps who are breaking down his defences, ever so surely.
ARC_ARCHIVE_HITODAMA_TXT_0014	Height: 4 cutting boards\nWeight: A kitchen knife\nPersonality: Mothering\nHobby: Cooking\n\nFun Guy is probably the greatest chef of all the wisps. His ability to turn the random assortment of knickknacks the other wisps find in the forest into delicious dishes has made him a quite valued member of the hideaway. And while he loves to cook, he loves others enjoying his cooking as well.\n\nSince he was a child, he always loved experimenting with new and exotic flavours, which led him to Avalon. He's not remorseful about becoming a wisp, telling himself that now he can eat and eat and never gain weight. The only problem the other wisps have with Fun Guy is that sometimes his zeal for trying new tastes can lead to him sneaking some suspicious shrubbery into his recipes.
ARC_ARCHIVE_HITODAMA_TXT_0015	Height: 4 dandelions\nWeight: Patch of thistle weed\nPersonality: Curious\nHobby: Zoology\n\nVince is a scholar on a mission to study all walks of life - becoming a wisp hasn't changed that a bit. Every day he treks deeper into the forest on another wildlife excursion, notebook in hand. To Vince, that's all there is; nothing else could give his life meaning. He even tries studying the faeries, his curiosity seemingly overcoming any fear or hatred harboured towards them. When he spots one, he sneaks up as close as he can to observe them, almost completely disregarding his own safety.\n\nVince's insatiable curiosity has always been with him, even in his previous life. He left a respected academic position to seek the truly unknown, which is how he first arrived in Avalon. He tries to impart the wisdom of his findings and observations to the other wisps, but they find him a little hard to understand.
ARC_ARCHIVE_HITODAMA_TXT_0016	Height: A slightly short fishing rod\nWeight: Approx. one wooden lure\nPersonality: Gossipy\nHobby: Gossip\n\nCaptain is a wisp that loves to gossip. Factually proven? Save that boring stuff for the dictionary. Inconclusive...that's just another word for alluring mystery. Fishing for a big scoop has been known to get him in trouble a few times, but that just adds to the thrill. At the hideaway, he calls himself an ace reporter, mostly as an excuse to butt in to the other wisps' private lives. He has a regular column in the "Wisp Weekly", where the small town gossip he picks up suddenly gets decorated with lavish colour; a true favourite read of local wisp residents. Recently he's been hoping to do some street journalism with a few faeries, but alas, he doesn't speak the lingo.
ARC_ARCHIVE_HITODAMA_TXT_0017	Height: A tiny tuna\nWeight: Just a tad more than a striped bass\nPersonality: Scatterbrain\nHobby: Fishing\n\nAnything you want to know about fishing - just ask Fishy.\n\nA crazed fishing enthusiast, he provides the hideaway with the majority of their fish intake. His skills as a fisherwisp are no joke; he always brings in a large catch. The problem is the catch rarely makes it back home. Often he'll be so absorbed in fishing, forest animals will sneak up and take what he's already caught. Other times he'll get lost on the way home and everything will spoil. The big fishbone latched onto his head is there because he thought he might be able to catch something big if he used himself as a lure. He's a bit of a fishbrain, but most of the other wisps in Avalon find that side of him to be endearing.
ARC_ARCHIVE_HITODAMA_TXT_0018	Height: Still growing\nWeight: Getting there\nPersonality: Rugged\nHobby: Physical training\n\nWrapper is a girl wisp with a bandage wrapped around her head.\n\nThe bandage covers the bruises she receives during her excruciating daily exercise routine. She trains tirelessly day and night to be bigger and tougher than any wisp, or faerie for that matter. That said...her results are still mediocre at best. She continually challenges bulkier wisps to duels, but loses almost every time; hence the bandages and bruises.\n\nGoal-focused, she sometimes modifies the playground equipment in the hideaway to make her own personal exercise machines. The other wisps, having no idea the equipment has been tinkered with, are very curious as to why they suddenly feel stronger than before. Ironically, this has made an endless line of rivals for her.
ARC_ARCHIVE_HITODAMA_TXT_0019	Height: 122.624 cm\nWeight: 21.262 g\nPersonality: Sensitive\nHobby: Cleaning\n\nBig Nails has some nails jabbed in his head, and one in his belly too. He's quite sensitive; he notices and cares about little things that other wisps wouldn't. \n\nHe loves to clean, and is extremely serious about it. He goes after all the tough spots in corners and nooks that most overlook, and everything is said to have a shimmer and glean to it when his work is done. Woe to the wisp who gets stuck cleaning with him; he demands the same meticulousness of others that he does of himself.  \n\nAppearance-wise, he doesn't look so neat kept, which is something he himself seems a little bothered by. He's been trying hard to diet recently, but he still hasn't realised that wisps don't gain or lose weight.
ARC_ARCHIVE_HITODAMA_TXT_0020	Height: 2 helmets\nWeight: About 5 helmets\nPersonality: Headstrong\nHobby: Fossil collecting\n\nHardhead is about as stubborn of a wisp as you can get.\n\nHis opinion is the only right one, in fact it's the only one. He will not change his mind no matter the situation. If any wisp is ever fool enough to try and argue with him, it's a swift headbutt with his rock-hard head and sturdy half-helmet. \n\nHe enjoys collecting fossils, especially those of faeries in the forest. He's amassed quite an impressive collection, but it's probably best not to ask him about it - once he starts drolling about his stones, it could be hours, even days until the unsuspecting victim is set free.
ARC_ARCHIVE_HITODAMA_TXT_0021	Height: 8 top hats\nWeight: A gentlemen's weight\nPersonality: Showy\nHobbies: Hat making, singing\n\nSir Toppie is a wisp that values his appearance more than anything else. He loves to stand out, which the hat probably has something to do with. He occasionally puts on impromptu singing shows, just to try and get the attention of other wisps with his handsome baritone voice. His top hat is handmade, by himself, and he has a different one for each day of the week. He makes sure that no version is particularly fancy, as he wants to save that one for a special occasion. The fact that he is able to make his everyday hats look so identical seems like quite a talent in itself - but it just goes to show how he will do anything to look prim and proper.
ARC_ARCHIVE_HITODAMA_TXT_0022	Height: 5 saws\nWeight: A big ply of wood\nPersonality: Uneven\nHobby: Carpentry\n\nSawtooth is the local wisp carpenter. His work primarily consists of making more playground equipment for the wisps, and other modifications to the hideaway to make it a little more comfortable.\n\nAvalon has all the wood a carpenter could ever need, so his work keeps him pleasantly busy. He could probably be a little more careful though, as his measurements often tend to go somewhat under or somewhat over, so a lot of what he makes looks a little crooked. Still, this doesn't mean he's an amateur by any means, and he's definitely contributed a lot towards the hideaway's development. \n\nThe saw lobbed on his head was originally stuck there by the faeries, but he actually appreciates the convenience.
ARC_ARCHIVE_HITODAMA_TXT_0023	Height: A stack of flapjacks\nWeight: Apples & oranges\nPersonality: Foodie\nHobby: Eating, singing\n\nAlways waiting for his next meal, food is Lil' Slug's favourite thing, and he can't live without it (even though wisps don't necessarily need it). He leads a simple life - he's either eating, or trying to find a meal. When he eats something he likes, he sometimes sings for joy. The other wisps find it so cute that sometimes they can't help but give him a little snack. His body is always packed with energy due to his excessive eating, making him a favourite faerie target. \n\nWhen he's hungry is another story - he gets to be so dangerous that even lower-ranking faeries would hesitate trying to capture him, lest he gobble them for lunch. Needless to say, it's best to keep your distance when he's got an appetite.
ARC_ARCHIVE_HITODAMA_TXT_0024	Height: Unknown\nWeight: Unknown\nPersonality: Silent-type\nHobby: Unknown\n\nHe's Snout...and that's pretty much all the other wisps know about him. One day, he mysteriously appeared in the hideaway. No one knows how he got there, or why he came to the forest in the first place. Even the name Snout is just a nickname given to him by the other wisps - what his actual name is, no one knows. No one knows anything about Snout because...he never says anything. He just grunts sometimes. He seems to get by for the most part with some simple gestures. He doesn't say anything more, and no one asks. No one pries about his past because they understand some wisps have things they might not want to talk about. They also don't seem to notice that he might talk if someone just took the restraints off his face.
ARC_ARCHIVE_HITODAMA_TXT_0025	Height: All the darts sticking on him, stacked together\nWeight: All the darts sticking on him, stacked together\nPersonality: Flatterer\nHobby: Darts\n\nPunk is a wisp with a bunch of darts pinned to him. After the traumatic experience of being used as a dartboard by the faeries (which he's still recovering from), he tries his best now to make sure he's on everyone's good side.\n\nHe likes darts himself though, and draws little pictures of faeries on paper for his own target practice. As nice as he seems on the outside, the other wisps see his enthusiasm in this daily ritual, and they're careful to not get on his bad side either.\n\nRecently, his life as a wisp knows little trouble, but it's unsure if that's because he's nice to the other wisps, or because they're secretly scared of him.
ARC_ARCHIVE_HITODAMA_TXT_0026	Height: Heavenly\nWeight: Almost floating\nPersonality: Merciful\nHobby: Prayer\n\nAngel is a wisp with a halo and wings taped on. Friendly to a fault, she can always be seen with her signature smile. She has a deep compassion for all the living things of this world, never forgetting to give them a little daily prayer. Most wisps obviously have a lot of resentment for the faeries, but Angel actually wishes there were some way they could talk things out and bury the hatchet. She's even considering studying faerie language to better mediate. Born in a land fraught with endless war, she escaped to Avalon seeking refuge at a young age. Even now, she lives each day performing what good deeds she can, hoping true peace may come to this world someday.
ARC_ARCHIVE_HITODAMA_TXT_0027	Height: Sticks out like a sore thumb\nWeight: Just heavy enough to not get blown away\nPersonality: Single-minded\nHobby: Fortune telling\n\nBullseye is a wisp with a one track mind and a teensy obsession with fortune telling. She wants to meet the person of her dreams, and she's tried every thinkable way to do so: tarot cards, crystal ball, horoscopes, you name it. Her favourite is actually throwing knives with her as the target. In this game, luck is determined by your aim and your throwing arm. It sounds a bit cruel, but it's garnered quite a bit of attention just from its novelty. The hard part is that Bullseye herself gets to move around while you throw, so most wisps can barely even hit her in the first place, let alone the target on her hood. If anyone were able to make a perfect toss, Bullseye would surely consider them to be "the one", but no one has been lucky(?) enough to do so yet.
ARC_ARCHIVE_HITODAMA_TXT_0028	Height: 7 bumps on the head\nWeight: A small sandbag\nPersonality: Resilient\nHobby: Sparring\n\nBruce has a slightly strange obsession with pain. \n\nEver since becoming a wisp, he has thought one thing: You can overcome pain if you just get used to it. \n\nAll wisps can only die by releasing too many negative vibes; this dries out their life essence. Bruce realised that this means as long as you can control your negative vibes, you can theoretically live forever. So, he began training himself to become immune to pain, in hopes to cut off any of the negative feelings released because of it. He tells the other wisps to think of him as their own sandbag, free to whack and thwack as they please. The other wisps are kind of worried why Bruce would ask for people to do this. They think he's a little weird. But Bruce disregards their judging looks - this too, he says, is all part of the training.
ARC_ARCHIVE_HITODAMA_TXT_0029	Height: Don't care\nWeight: Don't care\nPersonality: Lazy\nHobby: Napping\n\nCindy is the lazy one of the bunch. She's got a few singes, but that doesn't really bother her (nothing does). Anything she is asked to do, she will almost definitely not do. Her morning routine is wake up, then back to sleep. After that, it's time for her afternoon nap. When she's finally awake, she's usually crawling around on the ground like a slug. All of a sudden it's night again, and she's back to bed. She's lived this way so long now, everyone around her just accepts that's the way she is. On the extremely rare occasion she ever feels inclined to work, the other wisps can barely hide their concern - something must be terribly wrong. \n\nIn her previous life, Cindy was actually quite the workaholic. Exhausted and overworked, Cindy escaped to Avalon hoping to find release from the stress of society. All things considered, becoming a wisp may have actually been good for her.
ARC_ARCHIVE_HITODAMA_TXT_0030	Height: 5 stacked lighters\nWeight: Bag of lighter oil\nPersonality: Impassioned\nHobby: Cooking in his smoker\n\nScott is a wisp with a few burn marks. Long ago, he was captured by the faeries in order to protect a close friend. The faeries threatened him, trying to learn his friend's location, but Scott refused to break. As a result, he got burned up pretty good, but it doesn't bother him. He's proud he was able to stand up for someone he cared about. Sometimes this mantra of his can get a little intense, preaching to the other wisps about standing up against oppressors and the like.\n\nHe's got quite the knack for smoking fish and nuts and such. His whole setup is made from special herbs he collects himself. After a cookout, he gives what he made to hungry little wisps about the hideaway. \n\nThe fire that originally scarred him still seems to burn away at him to this day, little by little, but he just tries to be a walking example of the philosophy he holds dear - don't forget what's important, and fight for it.
ARC_ARCHIVE_HITODAMA_TXT_0031	Height: 2 meters, if he tried\nWeight: 10 grams, minus the head\nPersonality: Insensitive\nHobby: Plant collecting\n\nSprout is a wisp that loves to collect and study plants. It seems as if the faeries planted something on the top of his head after hooding him. He realises the plant is sapping some of his body's energy, but he's never considered removing it. On the contrary, it seems to have made him love plants even more, constantly trying to expand his little collection in his corner of the hideaway. Some of the wisps find him a bit cold because he will never, ever give up one of his plants to a hungry wisp - to him, plants take first priority. Day by day, he gives his all trying to make the perfect little hideaway garden.
ARC_ARCHIVE_HITODAMA_TXT_0032	Height: 16 belts\nWeight: A belt buckle\nPersonality: Nosy\nHobby: Chatting\n\nLeatherhead is a chatty little wisp that can talk on and on for hours at a time.\n\nShe loves to rub her nose in other wisps' business. Any time she spots a wisp in trouble she comes running to help, broadcasting her plan of action the whole way. She's needed to learn a lot to fill her constant stream of words, so many wisps rely on her for practical advice. She does have a habit of getting ahead of herself, though, sometimes drawing conclusions well before she's heard even half of what the other wisp has to say. Still, as soon as trouble strikes, you can bet that she'll hear about it, so most wisps have to sit through her advice whether they want to or not. 
ARC_ARCHIVE_HITODAMA_TXT_0033	Height: 1 long needle + 1 short one\nWeight: 2 long needles\nPersonality: Calm & collected\nHobby: Embroidery\n\nNeedy's defining characteristic must be his unparalleled powers of concentration. If he starts working on something, no matter what distractions intervene, he will sit there and keep working on it right until it's done. This ability to focus has helped him create beautiful works of embroidery that are cherished by the others. He is always completely composed; no wisps have ever seen him lose his temper for even a second. Sometimes, his abilities of concentration can work against him though - so focused on the task at hand he forgets to even eat, eventually passing out from hunger. The other wisps find it adorable that someone with such a masterful hand could be so clumsy at living, and many have learned to quietly leave a little food nearby him when they see him working.
ARC_ARCHIVE_HITODAMA_TXT_0034	Height: Same as the wire\nWeight: Same as the wire\nPersonality: Shy\nHobby: Dancing, singing\n\nWired is a happy, cheerful girl. She's a bit shy and embarrasses easily, but she has a smile that can light up a room. Her hobbies are to dance and sing, and she can never turn down a little performance when asked, though she blushes almost the entire time. Secretly, she laments the fact that the barbed wire the faeries have wrapped around her head prevents her from close contact with the other wisps. But the other wisps try not to let it get to her. Her cheerfulness is a much needed medicine to heal some of the wisps' tired, heavy hearts.\n\nIn the past, she had dreamed about one day performing in the bright lights, so she seems happy to have found a little crowd that appreciates her song and dance now.
ARC_ARCHIVE_HITODAMA_TXT_0035	Height: Pair of scissors + half a pair of scissors\nWeight: Half a pair of scissors\nPersonality: Sharp\nHobby: Chess\n\nSnipster is the sage of the wisps. He's a quick thinker and he's excellent at maths.\n\nHis smarts are put to great use in expanding the hideaway, as he is able to create clever designs for new playground equipment all from random faerie garbage. Most of the equipment in the hideaway was either designed or improved by him, so he's really contributed quite a lot to the wisp community. Unfortunately, he refuses to work on anything he doesn't consider stimulating, which is why the defence systems of the hideaway are always lacklustre. He believes that living in a scary place like Avalon, a place to play and have fun is more important than anything. The other wisps agree: Snipster gives them something to take their mind off the threats lurking in every corner of the forest, so they can just relax for a moment. And it's this philosophy that has truly made Snipster the sage wisp.
ARC_ARCHIVE_HITODAMA_TXT_0036	Height: Two razors stacked sideways\nWeight: Same as the razor stuck in her head\nPersonality: Bossy\nHobby: Arguing\n\nStraight Edge is the type of wisp who doesn't really hold back.\n\nShe likes a straight answer, yes or no, and she hates anything in between. This has led to more than a few altercations with other wisps in the past, and some even avoid her in fear of being her next target. Straight Edge notices this, but she won't let it change her. Wisps are always at risk in Avalon; sometimes a moment's hesitation could mean the difference between life and death. She stands firm for the greater good. If that makes her "mean", she says so be it. That all said...she also just loves to argue in the first place, and especially proving someone else is wrong. This doesn't mean she doesn't care about the other wisps...but her curtness might not be solely for the sake of others, either.\n
ARC_ARCHIVE_HITODAMA_TXT_0037	Height: 7 wrenches\nWeight: 3 nuts or bolts\nPersonality: Just\nHobby: Reading\n\nPipes is probably the most dedicated and caring of the wisps.\n\nAlways lending a hand to those in trouble, he'd stand against a faerie at a pindrop if it meant saving another. His hobby of reading has given him a wealth of knowledge that he uses to support Colm how he can, almost like a trusty advisor. He also happens to be quite strong for a wisp, leading his own patrol group to keep watch around the hideaway. He's really a very good example of both brains and brawn. He never lets his own abilities go to his head, treating each and every wisp equally. This lack of flaws has made some of the wisps say they'd rather deal with a faerie than be on Pipes's bad side.
ARC_ARCHIVE_HITODAMA_TXT_0038	Height: Undisclosed until properly measured\nWeight: Undisclosed until properly measured\nPersonality: Tempered\nHobby: Long distance running\n\nMachina is all about routine. He believes it important to get up the same time each day, eat the same thing, and follow the same schedule. He goes on long distance runs along the same route every day - something other wisps would probably find monotonous, but he finds reassuring. His motto is "If it's been done before, it's proven - and it can be done again." His greatest joy is simply to complete something he planned to do, no matter how arbitrary the task. \n\nObviously, this means that any wisp who interrupts his routine is met with great scorn. The wisps who have known him for a long time say he used to be a lot more laid back, but his personality seemed to change completely after the faeries buried that bolt in his head.
ARC_ARCHIVE_HITODAMA_TXT_0039	Height: About 15 rolls of bandages\nWeight: A corset\nPersonality: Quiet\nHobby: Walks, singing\n\nPatches is a sweet girl. She has a frail frame and she never feels very well, resulting in her falling and scraping herself often. This has made being wrapped in bandages part of her trademark. She is younger and quieter than the other wisps, so many of them treat her like a little sister. She loves walks and loves to sing, so she can often be seen strolling and humming a little tune. \n\nIn her previous life she was chronically ill, and she visited Avalon hoping that becoming a wisp might relieve her from having to deal with her sickness. Sadly, the sickness remained. Nevertheless, she seems to have found happiness in her new life with the other wisps, always humming her sweet tune around the hideaway.
ARC_ARCHIVE_HITODAMA_TXT_0040	Height: Much shorter than a Great Oak\nWeight: A crinkled leaf\nPersonality: Disciplined\nHobby: Meditation\n\nTrent has lived in the forest as a wisp for many ages now. He is said to maybe even be the eldest of all living things in Avalon, which few deny when seeing he is slowly turning into wood. As can be expected with his age, he is wise, and considered to be like a living book of truths to the other wisps. Some of his wisdom has aged poorly, though, leading the younger wisps to not always see eye to eye with him. His time in the forest has made him very disciplined, requiring little food or sleep. He says it is necessary to do away with the temptations of the physical world to survive here, but everyone knows he naps during his daily meditation sessions. He seems to have a past with Ignis, but refuses to divulge any of it.
ARC_ARCHIVE_HITODAMA_TXT_9999	Height: ???\nWeight: ???\nPersonality: ???\nHobby: ???\n\nLooks like this wisp needs some help...

CORE_SNPSS_1010	Still hurt over parting from \nher mother Rosa, Cereza \napprenticed with the witch \nMorgana, training daily to \nbecome a powerful witch \nherself.
CORE_SNPSS_1020	Trusting the words of the boy \nfrom her dreams, Cereza goes \nagainst her teacher's warnings\nand sets off into the great \nforest unknown, trying to put \nher fears aside.
CORE_SNPSS_1030	Cereza and Cheshire's fateful \nmeeting. The two begin their \njourney in search of the white \nwolf, who is said to be able\nto give them incredible power \nthat might hopefully help \nCereza send Cheshire back \nto his home of Inferno.
CORE_SNPSS_1040	Cereza and Cheshire find \nthe white wolf, but he soon \nruns away. They again pursue \nhim, going further into the \ndepths of the forest.
CORE_SNPSS_1050	Cereza is asked by the boy \nfrom her dreams to destroy \nfour Elemental Cores somewhere\nin the forest. With this new \ngoal, she and Cheshire seek \nthe white wolf again.
CORE_SNPSS_1060	Reuniting with Morgana through \na magic spell, Cereza is told it \nwill take time until she will \nbe able to exit the forest. \nShe again decides to pursue \nthe white wolf.
CORE_SNPSS_1070	Destroying the first Elemental \nCore, Cereza and Cheshire \ncontinue into the depths\nof the forest to find the \nremaining three.
CORE_SNPSS_2010	Cereza and Cheshire meet \nColm, a wisp whose friends \nwere abducted by faeries. \nAfter arguing with Cheshire,\nCereza sets off alone \nto rescue them. 
CORE_SNPSS_2020	Reunited, Cereza and \nCheshire find Faerieland \nTower, where the wisps were\nbeing tormented. They make \ntheir way inside.
CORE_SNPSS_2030	Cereza and Cheshire save \nColm's friends from the \nfaeries. After a joyful wisp \nreunion, the duo follow after \ntheir newfound companions.
CORE_SNPSS_2040	The wisps guide Cereza \nand Cheshire to their secret \nhideaway. After resting, \nthe two return to the forest \nto seek out the remaining \ncores.
CORE_SNPSS_2050	After working together to\ndefeat the circus ringmaster \nAmadán Dubh, Cereza and\nCheshire search the circus \ntent for an Elemental Core.
CORE_SNPSS_2060	After destroying the second \nElemental Core, Cereza and \nCheshire test out their newly\nacquired powers while again \nchasing after the white wolf.
CORE_SNPSS_2070	The two take off after the \nthird core, said to be at \nthe bottom of Lake Nimueh.\nIn order to drain the lake, \nCereza must climb the \ntallest tree in the forest.
CORE_SNPSS_3010	The duo are ambushed by \na monster with armour that \nproves Cheshire's claws\nmeaningless. Struck with \nfear, Cereza dashes away \nin the forest to hide.
CORE_SNPSS_3020	Thanks to Cereza's quick \nthinking, the two are able \nto drive the monster \naway. Now a bit more \nconfident, she and Cheshire \nresume their search for \nthe cores.
CORE_SNPSS_3030	After a tense battle, Cereza \nand Cheshire defeat the \nJabberwock. With the \nguidance of the white wolf, \nthey set off for the shrine \nholding the Elemental Core.
CORE_SNPSS_3040	Cereza and Cheshire destroy \nthe third Elemental Core. \nUsing their newly acquired \npowers, they make their way \nto the final core.
CORE_SNPSS_3050	Cereza and Cheshire discover \nthat the final Elemental Core \nis inside Púca's Fortress. \nFor Lukaon's sake, as well \nas her own, Cereza \nresolves to break in.
CORE_SNPSS_4010	The faeries create an illusion \nof Cereza's mother that causes \nher and Cheshire to have \na big fight. Leaving Cheshire, \nCereza makes her way to \nthe faeries' fortress alone.
CORE_SNPSS_4020	Cereza finds that Cheshire \nhas been caught by the \nfaeries. Putting their quarrels\naside, she infiltrates the \nfaerie fortress with some \nhelp from the white wolf.
CORE_SNPSS_4030	Rescuing a badly hurt \nCheshire, the two are \nfinally reunited. \nThe white wolf \ndisappears deep\ninside the fortress, and \nthe two chase after.
CORE_SNPSS_4040	After defeating the \nself-proclaimed faerie king \nPúca and his summoned\nangel, Cereza and Cheshire \nproceed to the last core.
CORE_SNPSS_4050	The two succeeded in \ndestroying the last core. \nWith their new powers, \nthe two leave the core's \nshrine behind them.
CORE_SNPSS_4060	Finally, Cereza and Cheshire \nhave destroyed all four of \nthe Elemental Cores.\nLed by the white wolf, the \ntwo make their way \nto see Lukaon.
CORE_SNPSS_5010	Cereza succeeds in calming \nCheshire after he is put under\na spell by Púca. Reaffirming \nthe bond grown between them,\nthey hurry to find Lukaon.
CORE_SNPSS_6010	Double-crossed by Lukaon, \nCereza and Cheshire work \ntogether to stop him. After \ncoming to his senses, \nLukaon helps the two\nfind a way out of the forest.
CORE_SNPSS_6020	Púca brings about an army \nof faeries to stop Cereza. \nCheshire mounts Cereza on\nhis back and the two head \ntowards a pillar of light \nMorgana has created.
CORE_SNPSS_6030	Morgana reveals her true \nintentions to sacrifice \nCheshire to save her \nson's life. Cereza gathers \nher courage to stand against\nthe one who once was \nher teacher.
CORE_SNPSS_6035	Cereza witnesses the ends \nof Morgana and Lukaon, \nboth victims of a cruel and \ntragic fate. She turns \nto Cheshire to say \none last goodbye, \nand finally...
CORE_SNPSS_6040	Cereza's time in Avalon \nhelped her grow in many \nways. Keeping the memories\nof her friends close to her \nheart, she sets off to \na new journey.

CORE_HTDMMESS_0004_001_H04	Sometimes I feel I just need to hide \nfrom it all. Maybe if I used a plant...? \nCould you help?
CORE_HTDMMESS_0004_002_H04	Geez...I'm so scared the faeries'll come \nat any time...you've gotta give me \nsomething to help me hide!
CORE_HTDMMESS_0004_003_H04	Thanks, you saved me big time.\nWait, a hideaway? Where is it?\nThat sounds way safer than here!
CORE_HTDMMESS_0006_001_H06	Do you have anything I could use\nas maybe a needle...substitute?\nJust needs to be pointy.
CORE_HTDMMESS_0006_002_H06	Mmm...all of these needles are no good...\nHow am I supposed to work like this?
CORE_HTDMMESS_0006_003_H06	Yes! This is just the pointy-ness I need!\nI could make this into a great needle!
CORE_HTDMMESS_0008_001_H08	I want power - strong enough to stand\nup to any faerie I see! Can you help?
CORE_HTDMMESS_0008_002_H08	I'm a hunter. I should be shooting arrows,\nnot being shot at!
CORE_HTDMMESS_0008_003_H08	Will this make me stronger...? Ugh, \nthe stench! I'll go back to the hideaway \nand try it...thanks!
CORE_HTDMMESS_0013_001_H13	Heh...Sis. Help me out, okay? \nThis is something that's going\nto be really far out, trust me.
CORE_HTDMMESS_0013_002_H13	I can hear it, ya know...the voices, \ncalling me to the dimension beyond here.
CORE_HTDMMESS_0013_003_H13	Heh...I'm thrilled! You actually got it.\nThanks for helping me out, sis.
CORE_HTDMMESS_0015_001_H15	I tell you, this forest truly is full of\nwonder...if you happen to come across\nany strange plantlife, do tell!
CORE_HTDMMESS_0015_002_H15	Hi, just jotting something\ndown about this plant, hold on...
CORE_HTDMMESS_0015_003_H15	This, this is Mandragora! \nAnd it's in great condition! \nI've got to research this further!
CORE_HTDMMESS_0017_001_H17	The big catch! Big, big fish!\nYou, witch lady! Gimme some bait, will ya?
CORE_HTDMMESS_0017_002_H17	The fish around here are fat, \nbut they're picky. If I'm not careful, \nthey'll make me bait.
CORE_HTDMMESS_0017_003_H17	Thanks witch lady! Now, on with the fis-\nWait a minute! I forgot my rod!
CORE_HTDMMESS_0021_001_H21	I loathe always hiding...give me something\nthat lets me step out in the bright lights,\nthat can truly make me shine!
CORE_HTDMMESS_0021_002_H21	Feather in your cap and all that...\nThat's the road to greatness!

CORE_HTDMMESS_0026_002_H26	It's terrible the faeries must \nact so horrible. If only we could \nall get along...
CORE_HTDMMESS_0026_003_H26	Oh, you amazing witch!\nI could just kiss you!
CORE_HTDMMESS_0028_001_H28	If I can just take the pain, \nthose faeries won't be scary any more! \nSo, please, show me...
CORE_HTDMMESS_0028_002_H28	Hey, let's make this clear. \nIt's not that I actually like pain.\nI'm not some kinda masochist.
CORE_HTDMMESS_0028_003_H28	Excellent...this is just what I needed!\nNow nothing they do can harm me!\nI'll see you back at the hideaway!
CORE_HTDMMESS_0029_001_H29	I'm just so...tired. Everything's a chore.\nMedicine? Just do it quick, okay?
CORE_HTDMMESS_0029_002_H29	After those faeries caught me...\nIt's just too meh to do anything.
CORE_HTDMMESS_0029_003_H29	This medicine...Hmmm...Is it...?\nYou know, this might \nwake me up some.
CORE_HTDMMESS_0032_001_H32	Colm always is doing his best - I want\nto do something in return. Got anything?
CORE_HTDMMESS_0032_002_H32	I've been looking for something for him,\nand I got lost all the way out here.
CORE_HTDMMESS_0032_003_H32	Thanks, Colm will love this!\nAnyway, guess I'll just zip back\nto the hideaway!
CORE_HTDMMESS_0034_001_H34	Eck, my throat is so sore...\nhave anything that might help?
CORE_HTDMMESS_0034_002_H34	I'm supposed to be a lookout but...\nI can't call for help with a sore throat!
CORE_HTDMMESS_0034_003_H34	Thanks, I'll head to the hideaway now. \nLet me sing a little for you \nwhen I feel better.
CORE_HTDMMESS_0037_001_H37	I like the tranquillity here, but sometimes\nI'd like a change of pace. Any...ideas?
CORE_HTDMMESS_0037_002_H37	I'm a workaholic. And Avalon is a scary\nforest, so sometimes you just need\nsomething to take your mind off, you know?
CORE_HTDMMESS_0037_003_H37	Thank...s...ugh...that is a potent smell.\nI better get back before any faeries find me.
CORE_HTDMMESS_0039_001_H39	*Cough, cough* Sorry...\nfeeling a bit under the weather. \nDo you have any medicine?
CORE_HTDMMESS_0039_002_H39	*Wheeze* Thought I wouldn't get sick\nany more if I was a wisp...
CORE_HTDMMESS_0039_003_H39	Thanks, witch lady. I found some food\ntoo, so I think it might be time to \nstart heading back.

CORE_WISP_TALK_32_H18	*Gasp* Thanks for the help!\nThose darn faeries...I'll show them!
CORE_WISP_TALK_33_H19	Thanks, only took you...\n34,506,250 seconds to save me.
CORE_WISP_TALK_34_H20	Blegh, I ache all over. \nThanks for the help, witch lady.
CORE_WISP_TALK_36_H22	I...I can move again?\nYou're the one who saved me...thanks!
CORE_WISP_TALK_38_H24	(Cereza tries to listen, \nbut it just sounds like noise...)
CORE_WISP_TALK_39_H25	C-c-c-cold! Thought I was gonna \nbecome an icicle! Thanks! \nI'll get those faeries someday...
CORE_WISP_TALK_41_H27	I saw in a vision...you would save me.\nPerhaps...us meeting...is fate?
CORE_WISP_TALK_44_H30	To be caught...oh, for shame!\nNow it's my turn to protect everyone!
CORE_WISP_TALK_45_H31	Thank you for helping me.\nDo you know...if my plants are safe?
CORE_WISP_TALK_47_H33	Hmph, saved at last. Guess I should \nbe thankful. If only those faeries \nwould settle down some.
CORE_WISP_TALK_49_H35	Looks like I'm saved, all right!\nTime to get back and start inventing.
CORE_WISP_TALK_50_H36	Those faeries are atrocious!\nThey almost cut off my poor little head!
CORE_WISP_TALK_52_H38	Finally, reinforcements...glad I held out.\nTime to get back into routine...

CORE_WISP_TALK_58_FAS	Be careful of the faeries. \nThey don't know the meaning of mercy.
CORE_WISP_TALK_59_FAS	I heard Colm wanted to see you.\nSaid there was something he wanted to say.
CORE_WISP_TALK_60_FAS	Why don't you visit the hideaway sometimes?\nI'm sure all the wisps would be \nso happy to see you.
CORE_WISP_TALK_61_FAS	I've got a little message from Colm:\n"I wanna see you again! Drop by sometime!"
CORE_WISP_TALK_62_COL	I'm so glad everyone's safe...\nThank you so much, Cereza!

CORE_WISP_TALK_71_FAS	Salutations, Cereza. \nFinding those wolf tracks okay?
CORE_WH_TALK_01_COL	Hey, Cereza. \nDid you find any more of our friends?
CORE_WH_TALK_02_COL	If you find more of our friends, be sure\nto tell them about this place. They'll be\nlost by themselves, you know.
CORE_WH_TALK_03_COL	Those faeries...\nI really wonder how they can be so cruel.
CORE_WH_TALK_04_COL	Wow, a lot of wisps have made it back!\nAll thanks to you and that umm...\nFriend of yours!

CORE_WH_TALK_07_COL	The hideaway is bustling! I hope we\ncan make it a place where all \nwisps are safe.
CORE_WH_TALK_08_COL	Did you hear we started a patrol unit!?\nI mean, we can't actually fight \nthe faeries, but...
CORE_WH_TALK_09_COL	Hideaway rule #1: Don't mix work\nand play. That's our only rule!
CORE_WH_TALK_10_COL	Cereza, and your cat friend! \nHow've you been? I've missed you.
CORE_WH_TALK_11_COL	We're having a blast here thanks to you.\nWhy don't you stay and play for a bit?
CORE_WH_TALK_12_COL	I've been working out, can you tell?\nCan't have those faeries push \nme around forever!
CORE_WH_TALK_13_COL	We added to the hideaway some, \ndid you notice? There's even \nmore places to play now!
CORE_WH_TALK_14_COL	The hideaway is even bigger than before!\nStop and play for a bit, won't ya?
CORE_WH_TALK_15_COL	Thanks for saving our friends!\nThis is some thanks from everyone!
CORE_WH_TALK_16_COL	Cereza, Cheshire, thanks for everything!\nHere's a showing of my gratitude.
CORE_WH_TALK_17_COL	Here, this is for you.\nI hope you find it useful.

CORE_WH_TALK_19_COL	Everyone wants to share their thanks.\nHey everybody, come on!
CORE_WH_TALK_20_COL	There are still more wisps in the forest.\nPlease, you've got to help!
CORE_WH_TALK_21_COL	If you find any wisps, tell them \nto come here. I'm sure they'd be \nlost and scared alone.
CORE_WH_TALK_22_COL	Sorry to always ask you for help.\nBut if you can, please do save our friends.

AC_NARRATION200_0010	Cereza was surrounded by a crisp, \nrefreshing scent coming from the trees.
AC_NARRATION200_0020	She could feel the whisper of a mysterious power, \ncarried by the wind from further within.
AC_NARRATION210_0010	A gigantic tower built by the faeries.\nStrange contraptions were scattered about its base.
AC_NARRATION210_0020	Its haphazard construction reflected \nthe disorder in the faeries' hearts.
AC_NARRATION215_0010	The secret base of the wisps,\ntucked away in the forest.
AC_NARRATION215_0020	Thanks to Cereza and Cheshire, \nplayful shouts of joy had begun to return.
AC_NARRATION220_0010	A giant faerie fort, towering in the forest shadows.
AC_NARRATION220_0020	Atop its peak the jagged mouth of a massive rift.\nWhatever might the faeries be planning inside...?
AC_NARRATION225_0010	All of the Elemental Cores were destroyed, \nand their barriers were no more.
AC_NARRATION225_0020	What waited for them beyond, they could not imagine.
AC_NARRATION230_0010	A magnificent tree rose before them.\nIts pure-white branches stretched as far as the eye could see.
AC_NARRATION230_0020	It has stood as a symbol of the \nfaerie kings of Avalon for generations.
AC_NARRATION235_0010	The churning waters of this waterfall \nflowed to meet Lake Nimueh.
AC_NARRATION235_0020	Cereza felt small before the \ngreat rumble of the rapids.
AC_NARRATION240_0010	Clear, glistening water, ever-flowing, \nbrought life to all of Avalon Forest.
AC_NARRATION240_0020	Cereza and Cheshire drank their \nfill and felt immediately refreshed.
AC_NARRATION245_0010	The ravages of time had not been kind to this palace, but they were unable to completely erase its former majesty.
AC_NARRATION245_0020	Cereza remembered hearing that long ago \na faerie queen resided in just such a place.
AC_NARRATION250_0010	A dazzling grove with gently lapping waves; \na striking contrast to the eerie Avalon Forest.
AC_NARRATION250_0020	Enjoying the warm sand and cool breeze,\nCereza thought perhaps there was some\nkindness in faerie hearts after all.
AC_NARRATION255_0010	Cereza and Cheshire came across a pool where \nlily pads stretched as far as the eye could see.
AC_NARRATION255_0020	Just how long would it take for this many to grow?\nThey stood in awe of the forest's diligent workings.
AC_NARRATION260_0010	Having saved so many wisps, Cereza and Cheshire \nhad become heroes among Avalon's downtrodden.
AC_NARRATION260_0020	The peaceful inhabitants of the forest would sing \ntales of their bravery for years to come. The kind-\nhearted witch and her steadfast demon companion.
AC_IGNIS200_0000_0010	Don't dawdle now!
AC_IGNIS200_0010_0020	The secret path awaits...

Text/Ending
BK_7000_0010_LUC	“Cereza...Cheshire...”
BK_7000_0020_LUC	“You did the right thing,\nstopping my mother.\nIt was an honour to meet you both.”
BK_7000_0030_NAR	It was almost time\nto say goodbye to Lukaon.\n
BK_7000_0040_CER	“I wish...\nWe could have become friends.”
BK_7000_0050_LUC	“We did Cereza...\nAnd for that I am thankful.”
BK_7000_0060_NAR	Mother and child shared \na tender embrace.\nThis was the warmth he \nhad been dreaming of.
BK_7000_0070_LUC	“Thank you for always \nwatching over me Mother. \nYou can rest now...”
BK_7000_0080_LUC	“I'm happy I was able to see your\nface...one last time...”
BK_7000_0090_MOR	“Goodnight my son.\nSweet dreams...”
BK_7000_0100_NAR	Cereza did not know where faerie \nsouls went in this chaotic world,\nbut wherever Lukaon wound up,\nshe hoped he would find peace.
BK_7000_0150_NAR	The end had come \nfor Morgana the witch.
BK_7000_0160_NAR	Her peaceful expression was\nreplaced by one of agony.\nIt was almost too much to watch.
BK_7000_0170_NAR	This is the fate that awaits every\nUmbra Witch: an eternity wandering\nthe depth of Inferno.
BK_7000_0175_NAR	Cereza did not look away.\nShe watched as Morgana's soul was dragged to the underworld.
BK_7010_0000_NAR	Cheshire realised that this\nunexpected twist of fate had\ndelivered exactly what he sought:\na door to Inferno lay before him.
BK_7010_0010_NAR	But the portal was already\ngrowing unstable. It threatened\nto close at any moment.
BK_7010_0020_NAR	The journey had left the demon\ntotally exhausted. Struggling to\nkeep his eyes open, he stared\npensively at his door home.
BK_7010_0030_CER	“That gate will take you \nback to Inferno.”
BK_7010_0040_CER	“Go on, it'll close soon...”
BK_7010_0045_NAR	Cheshire looked back at Cereza.\nHis expression said\nwhat they were both thinking:\n[FONT:9 ]If I go back you'll be all alone.[FONT:N ]
BK_7010_0050_CER	“Even after all we've been through\nyou're still going to treat me like \na kid? Just wait, I'll be strong \nenough to summon you myself \nin no time.”
BK_7010_0060_CER	“You just take it easy for awhile, okay?”
BK_7010_0070_NAR	Cheshire quietly turned \nback towards the portal.
BK_7010_0090_CER	“I'm going to keep getting stronger,\nI promise!”
BK_7010_0100_NAR	A tremendous sound erupted \nfrom the portal. But Cheshire's \nvoice cut through the din:\n[FONT:9 ]I'd expect nothing less![FONT:N ]
BK_7010_0110_CER	“And you better be one hell of\na ferocious demon \nnext time we meet!”
BK_7010_0120_NAR	A calm returned to Avalon Forest.\nAs if to wash away the pain of\nthe night, the first rays of dawn\nenveloped Cereza, bathing her in\ntheir warmth.
SM_007010_0000_JEA	I knew you'd make it.
SM_007010_0010_JEA	“Come on, let's go!”
SM_007020_0000_JEA	“Looks like you'll be \nfine on your own, Cereza.”
SM_007020_0010_CER	“Jeanne...thank you.\nI'll see you again \nwhen this is over.”
BK_7020_0000_CER	“I did it mother, I'm a witch.\nI'm strong, and I'll get stronger.\nYou don't need to worry any more.”
BK_7020_0010_ROS	“Cereza.”
BK_7020_0030_CER	“Mother!”
BK_7020_0040_ROS	“You have grown into \na splendid witch, Cereza.\nYou are going to be just fine...”
BK_7020_0050_NAR	Once a regular nightmare,\nafter that day Cereza never\nsaw that dream again.
BK_7020_0060_NAR	Meetings and Farewells...\nThinking of the promise she made to\nher friend, Cereza knew that she \nhad gained something irreplaceable.
BK_7020_0070_NAR	The night was young.\nCereza set off on her next adventure,\nthe pale moon lighting her way.
Text/Episode1
IN_1000_0000_NAR	Massive trees blocked almost all light from \nthe moon. An eerie silence enveloped Cereza.
IN_1000_0010_NAR	She cautiously ventured onwards.\n
IN_1000_0030_CER	D-don't surprise me like that!
IN_1000_0050_NAR	Looking into the dark underbrush,\nCereza could not shake the feeling\nthat someone was looking back.
IN_1000_0060_NAR	As the wind rustled the leaves,\nit sounded just like a rasping voice\nwhispered in her ear.
IN_1000_0080_CER	I can't turn back now...\nI'm going to become a witch,\nand save Mummy!
PH_1010_0000_CER	What was that!?\nMust have been a rabbit, or something,\nright Cheshire?
PH_1010_0010_CER	Is...is someone out there?
BK_1000_0000_NAR	Cereza could not shake the\nfeeling she was being watched.
BK_1000_0010_CER	“I-is someone there? \nShow yourself!”
BK_1000_0020_NAR	\nAnd then, as if to answer her call...\n
BK_1000_0030_NAR	These were faeries, nefarious \ncreatures who ensnare the souls \nof humans who venture into\nthe woods to feed on their vitality.
BK_1000_0040_NAR	This time there was nowhere to run.\nCereza was backed into a corner.
BK_1000_0050_CER	“Please...Please work this time!”
BK_1000_0060_NAR	Fingers crossed, Cereza prepared \nto use the summoning spell \nshe learned from Morgana.
BK_1000_0080_NAR	Even after the summoning \ncircle had faded away,\nno one had answered her call...
BK_1000_0090_CER	“Why!? I did everything right...”
BK_1000_0100_NAR	The faeries resumed their sinister mission.\nAll at once they jumped at Cereza, weapons poised to strike.
BK_1000_0110_NAR	She shut her eyes tight, \nand prepared for the worst.\nA moment passed. And then another,\nbut she felt not so much\nas a pinprick.
BK_1000_0130_CER	“What...who are you?”
BK_1000_0140_NAR	Chomp!
BK_1000_0150_NAR	That beast, as dark as a moonless night...\nHad it all been a dream?
BK_1000_0160_CER	“You don't think...\nCould that have been...”
BK_1000_0170_NAR	But before Cereza could \nfinish her question--
SM_001010_0000_CER	“Ch-Cheshire?”
SM_001010_0010_NAR	Cereza's stuffed cat Cheshire\ntransformed into some kind of beast\nright before her eyes.
SM_001010_0020_NAR	From its gaping maw, extending ear to ear,\nfell a drop of thick slobber.
SM_001010_0030_CER	“Wait...did I manage to summon a demon,\nthat has now possessed Cheshire?”
SM_001010_0040_NAR	As if in reply\nthe beast growled and\nbared its blood-red fangs.
SM_001010_0050_NAR	Just as Cereza feared,\na demon had indeed possessed\nher beloved stuffed cat.
SM_001010_0060_NAR	The creature had desperately sought\na medium in order to survive in our world.\nIn lieu of hair, it settled for one made of felt.\n
SM_001010_0080_NAR	Looking around, the demon's \neyes found Cereza.\nIt let out a low growl.
SM_001010_0090_NAR	After her initial terror,\nCereza realised that she was able to\nunderstand what the demon was saying.
SM_001010_0100_CER	“You...you want me to return you to Inferno?”
SM_001010_0110_CER	“Now, how would one go about doing that?”\n
SM_001010_0120_NAR	Cereza had her hands full \ncalling a demon to this world.\nShe hadn't even begun to\nstudy the spell to send them back.
SM_001010_0130_NAR	Cereza once again heard the demon's words,\nthis time even more clearly.\n[FONT:9 ]Send me back! Send me back![FONT:N ]\nThe demon's rage\nincreased by the second,\nbut there was nothing Cereza could do.
SM_001010_0140_NAR	Out of patience,\nhe pounced!
BK_1010_0000_NAR	Claws like daggers descended \non Cereza!
BK_1010_0010_NAR	But what have we here?\nThe demon had stopped cold.\n
BK_1010_0020_NAR	As if bound by an invisible force,\nno matter how he struggled,\nhe was unable to touch Cereza.
BK_1010_0030_CER	“Calm down, \nyou're going to burst a seam!”
BK_1010_0040_CER	“Don't worry, I'll send you home!\nOnce I figure out how...”
BK_1010_0050_CER	“I'm on my way to get \na fantastic power.\nWith that, sending you back should\nbe a piece of cake!”
BK_1010_0060_NAR	Giving up his attack,\nthe demon turned \nhis attention elsewhere.
BK_1010_0070_NAR	Intrigued, but a little scared,\nCereza decided to follow a bit behind.
IN_1020_0000_NAR	The demon ran through the forest,\nsearching for a way home.
IN_1020_0010_NAR	The demon slashed with his\nrazor-sharp claws...but something felt off.
IN_1020_0015_NAR	His power seemed to escape him, \nslowly but surely.
SM_001020_0000_CER	“What's wrong?”
SM_001020_0010_NAR	The demon bared his fangs.\nHe was clearly suffering.
SM_001020_0020_CER	“Are you sick?\nOr hungry, perhaps?” 
SM_001020_0030_NAR	As Cereza approached, the demon felt\nthe strength return to his body.\nIn an instant, he felt right as rain.
SM_001020_0040_NAR	His body was linked \nto Cereza by powerful magic.\nMoving away from her\nrobbed it of its energy.
SM_001020_0050_CER	“What's that? \nI need to stay close to you?\nI've never heard of a spell like this before...”
SM_001020_0060_NAR	The demon seemed to have calmed down.\nRemembering that he could not touch her,\nCereza breathed a sigh of relief.
SM_001020_0080_NAR	[FONT:9 ]How do you plan on getting \nme back to Inferno?[FONT:N ]\nthe demon demanded.
SM_001020_0090_CER	“We first need to find a white wolf.\nHe'll show us the way.”
SM_001020_0100_NAR	[FONT:9 ]Leave it to me, I'll find 'im,[FONT:N ]\nsaid the demon as he clambered to his feet.
SM_001020_0120_CER	“Um...I'm Cereza.\nWhat's your name?”
SM_001020_0130_NAR	[FONT:9 ]I have no name,[FONT:N ]\nreplied the demon curtly.
SM_001020_0140_CER	“You don't have a name?\nThat must be terribly inconvenient.\n\nThough I must admit, I haven't\nthe faintest idea about demonic manners.”
SM_001020_0150_CER	“May I call you Cheshire?\nThat's the name of the stuffed cat \nyou decided to borrow, after all.”
SM_001020_0170_CER	“Well I need to call you something.\nIf you're going to make a fuss about it,\nwhy don't you just find a new body!”
SM_001020_0180_CER	“Fine. I'll just call you whatever I please.”
SM_001020_0190_NAR	And so, these strange companions\nset off in search of the white wolf.\nWhat mysteries await\nin Avalon Forest?
SM_001020_0200_NAR	
IN_1030_0000_CER	“Uh oh,\nI can't get down.\n\nHey Cheshire, can you find\na way to get me down from here?”
IN_1030_0020_CER	“I didn't mean take the whole tree down!”
SM_001040_0010_NAR	All at once, Cheshire's body shrunk \nto its original cuddly form.
SM_001040_0020_CER	“Cheshire!”
SM_001040_0030_NAR	Cereza ran to pick up Cheshire\nand held him tightly to her chest.\nIn her arms, Cheshire\nfelt his strength returning.
SM_001040_0040_NAR	Cereza calmed down and\nher fear subsided.
SM_001040_0070_NAR	[FONT:9 ]Release me at once![FONT:N ]\nEven in this form,\nthe demon did not seem\nhappy about being cuddled.
SM_001040_0080_CER	“Just hold still, will you!\nWhile you're small you\ncan't walk on your own, right?\nI'll carry you until you\ncan transform again.”
SM_001040_0090_CER	“Not having a massive demon\nbreathing down my neck will make\nit easier for me to calm down too.”
SM_001040_0110_NAR	While far from pleased about being\ntreated like a stuffed animal,\nthe demon had no choice but\nto swallow his pride.
SM_001060_0000_CER	“Hey, look over there...”
SM_001060_0010_NAR	Before them stood a large wolf.\nIts snow-white fur shone\npale silver in the moonlight.
SM_001060_0030_NAR	Cereza was captivated by the wolf.\nIt seemed almost not of this world. 
SM_001060_0040_CER	“Hey...wait!”
SM_001060_0050_LUC	“Avalon Forest...\nThe white wolf...guide you...”
SM_001070_0000_NAR	The pair searched high and low for the wolf,\nbut it had vanished without a trace.
SM_001070_0010_NAR	[FONT:9 ]This way![FONT:N ]\nCheshire was onto the wolf's scent.
SM_001070_0020_CER	“There's something here...”
SM_001070_0030_NAR	Upon close inspection,\nthere appeared to be distortions,\nas if the air itself had cracked.
SM_001070_0040_NAR	Equally confused,\nthe girl and demon exchanged a glance.
SM_001070_0050_NAR	[FONT:9 ]That wolf is just up ahead![FONT:N ]\nCheshire's indecision did not last long.\nBut try as he might, he was unable to\nopen the cracks any further.
SM_001070_0060_CER	“Try using magic to open it?\nCome on, we have no idea what's \nlurking on the other side!”
SM_001070_0080_NAR	Cheshire gave a mocking snort\nat Cereza's cowardice.
SM_001070_0090_CER	“I am not making excuses!”\n
SM_001070_0100_CER	“All right fine! \nOkay Cereza, just like you practised...”
BK_1030_0000_NAR	Once their eyes had adjusted to brilliant light,\nwhat lay before them was a sight\nunlike anything either had seen before.
BK_1030_0010_CER	“Cheshire, I've a feeling \nwe're not in Avalon any more.”
IN_1050_0000_NAR	The massive spheres in the strange contraption aligned, \nand a path of light appeared before them.
IN_1050_0010_CER	“This thing is massive...\nI wonder what it's for?”
BK_1040_0000_CER	“You're the boy from my dream...”
BK_1040_0010_LUC	“Centre...Forest...\n...waiting...”
BK_1040_0020_LUC	“Help me...Power....”
BK_1040_0030_CER	“Okay,\nI just need to follow\nthe white wolf, right?”
BK_1040_0040_LUC	“Destroy...\nFour...Elemental Cores...”
BK_1040_0050_LUC	“You...can do it...”
BK_1040_0060_LUC	“Follow...\nWhite wolf...”
SM_001090_0000_NAR	They had returned from the strange world.\nThe forest was just as they had left it,\nexcept...not quite.
SM_001090_0010_NAR	It seemed that destroying the \ndevice at the core of that rift
SM_001090_0020_NAR	They spotted the white wolf.\nWithout a moment's hesitation,\nthe pair gave chase.
PH_1b01_0000_NAR	They had returned from the strange world.\nThe forest was just as they had left it,\nexcept...not quite.
PH_1b01_0010_NAR	It seemed that destroying the device at \nthe core of that rift somehow disrupted the \nillusion, revealing the true path forward.
PH_1b01_0020_NAR	They spotted the white wolf.\nWithout a moment's hesitation,\nthe pair gave chase.
BK_1050_0000_NAR	In a nearby grove,\nthere was a place \nilluminated by moonlight.
BK_1050_0005_NAR	As she approached,\nthe magic brace on Cereza's wrist\nbegan to glow. 
BK_1050_0010_MOR	“So, I have finally found you, Cereza.”
SM_001100_0000_CER	“Morgana!?” 
SM_001100_0010_NAR	Cereza blinked in disbelief as\nthe ghostly figure of her teacher\nappeared from within the moonlight.
SM_001100_0020_MOR	“Thank goodness you're safe...\nWhen I realised you'd gone to the forest,\nI was beside myself with worry.”
SM_001100_0030_MOR	“But really Cereza, to enter the forest\ndespite all my warnings;\nyou even made off with my magic brace.\nJust what were you thinking!”
SM_001100_0040_NAR	Although this was only a projection \nof Morgana, her scolding somehow \nmanaged to be even more\nintimidating than the genuine article. \nCereza could only hang her head.
SM_001100_0050_MOR	“I am looking forward to a thorough \nexplanation once you're home safe.\nBut I am afraid escaping \nAvalon Forest will not be easy.”
SM_001100_0060_NAR	Morgana's expression was grave.\nShe explained how the faeries' \nmagic turned the forest into \na labyrinthine trap; one in which \nCereza was currently ensnared.
SM_001100_0070_NAR	This ancient enchantment was so\nstrong even Morgana herself \ncould not easily break it.
SM_001100_0080_MOR	“For now all I can do is support \nyou from afar. I will begin \nresearching ways out of the forest.”
SM_001100_0090_MOR	“You just find a safe place,\nand try to stay alive until I find\na way to save you.”
SM_001100_0100_CER	“Don't worry, Morgana!\nLook, I was able to summon \na demon of my very own!”
SM_001100_0110_MOR	“Is that...\nYou summoned a demon \ninto your stuffed toy?”
SM_001100_0130_MOR	“Cereza...Well, it will have to do.\nIf you are able to wield that demon,\nyour chances of survival \nwill increase greatly.”
SM_001100_0140_MOR	“This forest belongs to the faeries.\nHowever, if you search carefully,\nI am sure you will find objects that\nwill help you develop your magic abilities.”
SM_001100_0150_CER	“What about these sparkly things?\nI've picked up a bunch of them\nsince I got here.”
SM_001100_0160_MOR	“Yes...That crystalline structure \nis a stable source of magical energy.\nIf you feed it to the demon it\nmay awaken some new powers.”
SM_001100_0170_NAR	The light of the moon began to wane.\nWith it Morgana's visage grew faint.\nIt was as if the forest itself\nconspired to impede their plans.
SM_001100_0180_MOR	“Cereza, listen well: demons \nare weapons which we witches \nwield, not friends to be cuddled.\nRemember to treat them as such.”
SM_001100_0190_NAR	The remaining moonlight faded,\nand Morgana disappeared.
SM_001100_0210_NAR	Cheshire was in a foul mood.
SM_001100_0220_CER	“Wh-what was that?!\nMorgana is my master, and I will \nnot have you speak of her in that way!”
SM_001100_0230_CER	“I feel bad for worrying her...\nBut I don't get why she's so \nover-protective. I mean, I summoned \na demon and everything!”
SM_001100_0240_NAR	Cereza wished that just once\nMorgana would tell her she did a good job.
SM_001100_0250_NAR	She had already forgotten \nMorgana's scolding.
SM_001100_0260_CER	“Well, back to chasing the white wolf.\nIf we get that power, even Miss High-and-\nMighty Morgana will sing our praises.”
SM_001100_0270_CER	“Oh yeah, those little sparkly things...\nShe said they might help you grow stronger.\nI wonder what that means...”
BK_1060_0000_CER	“Where did that wolf \nrun off to now?”
BK_1060_0010_CER	“What's that over there?\nLet's go check it out!”
BK_1060_0020_NAR	All of a sudden a tough-looking faerie \nappeared out of nowhere!\nCereza was startled,\nbut tried to regain her composure.
BK_1060_0040_CER	“W-why don't you flock off already\nand leave us alone!”
BK_1060_0070_NAR	Cheshire let out a sigh\nas he pushed past Cereza\nto face down the faerie.
BK_1060_0080_NAR	[FONT:9 ]Who's going to be the appetizer,\nand who shall I save for dessert![FONT:N ]\nroared Cheshire, his mane rippling and claws extended.
PH_1060_0000_CER	White wolf, wait!
BK_1020_0000_NAR	A strange orb atop a pillar...\nCould this be the Elemental Core\nof which the boy in Cereza's dream\nhad spoken?
BK_1020_0010_NAR	Before it stood the white wolf.\n
BK_1020_0020_NAR	Just as Cereza took a step\ntowards the pillar to investigate...
BK_1020_0040_CER	“Wait, what are you doing?!”
BK_1020_0050_NAR	Leaping from Cereza's grasp,\nCheshire lunged towards the wolf.
BK_1020_0070_NAR	[FONT:9 ]Stop running and tell us\nhow to get that power already![FONT:N ]
BK_1020_0080_NAR	Cheshire was fed up with this\nwild wolf chase. He wanted answers.
BK_1020_0090_CER	“Cheshire, stop and listen\nfor a second!”
BK_1020_0120_NAR	Missing his mark,\nCheshire's claws struck\nthe Elemental Core instead.\nAll was quiet. Until...
BK_1020_0130_NAR	Energy poured from the core like a furious whirlpool.\nStanding in its midst, Cereza felt a strange power flow through her.
BK_1020_0140_CER	“W-what was that? \nI feel funny...”
BK_1020_0150_NAR	[FONT:9 ]Don't hog the power girl![FONT:N ]\nCheshire roared his protest.
BK_1020_0160_NAR	He wanted his piece of the pie.\nBut what exactly had they released?\n
PH_1030_0000_CER	I feel the same energy as before\nComing from that plant...
SM_001120_0000_NAR	The pair had gained a new ability.\n[FONT:9 ]Is this it? I can go home now?[FONT:N ]\nCheshire asked excitedly.
SM_001120_0010_CER	“No, this is something different...\n\n\nWe need to smash three more of \nthose things before I can send you back.”
SM_001120_0030_CER	“B-but, I'm sure this power will \ncome in handy for something too!”
SM_001120_0050_CER	“I know, I know!\nThat is why we're following that\nwolf in the first place!”
SM_001120_0060_NAR	Speaking of that wolf...\nWhere did he go now?
SM_001120_0070_NAR	To find the other Elemental Cores,\nthey first need to find him.
SM_001120_0080_CER	“I swear, you demons are \nmore trouble than you're worth!”
SM_001120_0090_NAR	The bickering companions left\nthe remains of the core behind them,\nheading ever deeper into the forest.
LV_001005_0000_CER	Don't look down. 
LV_001005_0010_CER	Come on, Cereza,\none foot in front of the other...
LV_001010_0000_CER	A plant from Inferno?\nI wonder how it would\nrespond to my magic...
LV_001015_0000_NAR	This was quite a pickle.\nBut Cereza knew how to get by without a scratch.
LV_001015_0010_CER	Cranky one, are you?\nI know just the spell to put you in your place! 
LV_001020_0000_NAR	Cereza finally found somewhere she could rest.
LV_001025_0000_NAR	The fresh scent tickled Cereza's nose. \nIt was rosemary, typically used \nto ward off evil spirits.
LV_001025_0010_NAR	The instant Cheshire had a sniff,\nhe started pawing at Cereza to get far away.
LV_001025_0020_NAR	Rosemary is despised by the denizens of Inferno. \nThey needed to find another route.
LV_001030_0000_CER	Cheshire, I've got it tied down! \nFinish it!
LV_001035_0000_CER	I'll go first and make a path.\nYou wait here.
LV_001050_0000_CER	Huh, even with you in there,\nCheshire still weighs the same as before.
LV_001055_0000_CER	Whoa, that's new!
LV_001060_0000_CER	More rosemary...
LV_001065_0000_CER	Okay, I'll go on ahead by myself.
LV_001070_0000_CER	Looks like there's a path above us too.
LV_001070_0010_CER	Cheshire, I'll toss you up there.\nSee if there's a way forward.
LV_001075_0000_CER	What have we here...
LV_001075_0010_NAR	There were signs that\na witch had set up camp here.
LV_001075_0020_CER	Perhaps I'm not the first \nwitch to enter this forest...
LV_001075_0030_CER	Ah well,\nit means we've got a place to rest.
LV_001080_0000_CER	A white wolf...\nIt's just like that boy said!
LV_001080_0010_CER	So if we follow that wolf...\nCome on Cheshire, let's hurry!
LV_001095_0010_NAR	A small glade of otherworldly \nbeauty opened before Cereza.
LV_001095_0020_NAR	This dark forest held secrets yet.\nCereza relaxed, ever so slightly.
LV_001100_0000_CER	Is this...faerie treasure?\nThey'd be hopping mad if I stole it.
LV_001105_0000_CER	I've never seen a barrier like that before.\nI'll bet the faeries are behind this.
LV_001105_0010_CER	Just what could they be guarding...
LV_001110_0000_CER	Those cheeky faeries...\nwhat's their problem!?
LV_001110_0010_NAR	[FONT:10 ]It's because they know you're weak![FONT:N ]\nCheshire patronised Cereza.
LV_001130_0000_CER	What is this...!?
LV_001130_0010_NAR	In one corner was a rock, polished to a shiny finish.\nThis would make a good substitute \nfor the mirror she used when training.
LV_001130_0020_CER	Hey...\nWithout Morgana breathing down my neck,\nI might be able to get in some good practice.
LV_001130_0030_CER	Worth a try...
LV_001145_0000_NAR	The path continued to a line of arching trees, \nwhich had grown together to form a tunnel.
LV_001145_0010_NAR	Could it be that the faeries \nwere trying to protect this place?
LV_001150_0000_CER	Wow, look at this...
LV_001150_0010_NAR	There was a serenity to this place \nthat calmed Cereza's nerves.
LV_001900_0000_CER	Hm?\nLook what we have here!
LV_001900_0010_CER	I'm not too shabby with concoctions you know.\nLet's give this a try.
LV_001905_0000_NAR	The world before Cereza seemed to warp and bend.\nShe blinked hard to no avail.
LV_001905_0010_NAR	Could this be a faerie trick?\nCheshire was losing patience with his hesitant companion.
LV_001905_0020_NAR	[FONT:10 ]Come on, we've still got that wolf to catch.[FONT:N ]
LV_001905_0030_CER	I'm getting ready, just give me a second!
LV_001910_0000_CER	What is this...?
LV_001910_0010_NAR	As soon as she took a step inside,\nshe felt as if the breath had frozen in her chest.
LV_001910_0020_NAR	All around her were sights strange \nand terrible, as if she had been \ndragged into a waking nightmare.
LV_001910_0030_CER	I-I'm fine!\nIt takes more than this to scare me!
LV_001915_0000_CER	How am I supposed to find my way in here...?\n
LV_001915_0010_NAR	Suddenly, Cereza's magic brace\nbegan to glow. What could it be?
LV_001915_0020_NAR	The light from the brace revealed\nthings Cereza was unable to see before.

SM_002110_0070_CER	“Cheshire!\nAhhh, now my hair's all sticky!”
SM_002110_0080_NAR	Cheshire enjoyed his snack\nas Cereza tried unsuccessfully\nto squeeze the pulp from her hair.
SM_002110_0090_CER	“Do you have any idea how important\nhair is to a witch? Be careful!”
SM_002110_0100_NAR	[FONT:9 ]Ya? All that fur on your head and a\nfat lot of good it's done you.[FONT:N ]\nThe demon's retort was surprisingly deft.
SM_002110_0110_CER	“Q-quiet!\nI'm working on it, just you wait!”
SM_002120_0000_NAR	[FONT:10 ]Can't you move any faster?[FONT:N ]\nThe wolf was getting away,\nand Cheshire was not happy about it.
SM_002120_0010_CER	I'm going as fast as I can!
SM_002120_0020_CER	We'd be able to move a lot\nfaster if you would give me\na ride on your back!
SM_002120_0040_NAR	The demon said nothing.\nHis glare was all the answer Cereza needed.
SM_002120_0050_CER	That's what I thought.
SM_002010_0000_CER	“Could that be...a wisp?”
SM_002010_0010_NAR	Cereza remembered something \nMorgana had told her long ago.\n\nChildren who perish in Avalon\nbecome wisps, their souls cursed\nto wander the forest forever...
SM_002010_0020_CER	“Hi there little guy...are you okay?”
SM_002010_0030_COL	“Who are you? Are you lost?”
SM_002010_0040_CER	“Y-you can talk?!”
SM_002010_0044_CER	“I'm Cereza. What's your name?”
SM_002010_0060_COL	“I'm Colm!”
SM_002010_0070_CER	“Colm, you look troubled.\nIs something the matter?”\n
SM_002010_0080_COL	“My friends...\nThe faeries took them away.”
SM_002010_0090_NAR	Colm's lower lip quivered\nas he spoke.\n\nHe explained how the faeries\nwould round up wisps and tease\nthem for sport.
SM_002010_0100_COL	“I want to go help them,\nbut I don't stand a chance\nagainst those faeries!”
SM_002010_0110_CER	“You just leave those \nmean, old faeries to me!”
SM_002010_0120_COL	“What...for true!?”
SM_002010_0140_NAR	The wisp wasn't the only one \nsurprised by Cereza's bold claim.
SM_002010_0150_CER	“Well we can't just abandon them!”
SM_002010_0160_NAR	Girl and Demon squared off.\nNeither budged an inch.\n
SM_002010_0180_NAR	Cheshire made it clear he wanted\nno part in this daring rescue.\n\nBut Cereza was determined.\n
SM_002010_0190_CER	“Well I'm going, even if I have to\nfight those faeries myself!”
SM_002020_0000_CER	“Cheshire!”
SM_002020_0020_CER	“I knew you'd come.\nYou need my magic energy, after all.\nSince you're here, how about \nlending me a paw?”
SM_002020_0030_NAR	Cereza was secretly happy to see Cheshire,\nbut he was silently brooding.
SM_002020_0040_NAR	[FONT:9 ]Something happens to you,\nand it's my neck too.[FONT:N ]\nThe demon was just looking\nout for himself after all.
SM_002020_0050_CER	“Hmph.”
SM_002020_0060_CER	“Well, with or without you,\nI'm still going to help those wisps.\nYou just sit back and watch!”\n
SM_002020_0080_NAR	[FONT:9 ]Ya? How's a weakling like you\ngonna save anyone?[FONT:N ]\nThe demon chuckled,\nhis mouth twisted in a cruel grin.
SM_002020_0090_NAR	Pretending not to hear,\nCereza pressed ahead.
SM_002030_0000_CER	“So after all that fuss, \nyou're going to help after all.”
SM_002030_0010_NAR	Cereza teased the demon,\nwho responded with a cold glare.
SM_002030_0020_NAR	[FONT:10 ]I strike any pests who come near.\nUnlike you, I have the strength\nto protect myself,[FONT:N ]\nchided the demon.\n
SM_002030_0030_CER	“Is that so!”
IN_2000_0000_CER	So after all that fuss, \nyou're going to help after all.
IN_2000_0010_NAR	Cereza teased the demon,\nwho responded with a cold glare.
IN_2000_0020_NAR	[FONT:10 ]I strike any pests who come near.[FONT:N ]
IN_2000_0030_NAR	[FONT:10 ]Unlike you, I have the strength\nto protect myself, [FONT:N ]chided the demon.\n
IN_2000_0040_CER	Is that so!
SM_002040_0000_CER	“Thank goodness you're all safe.\nThat was a bit closer than I expected.”
SM_002040_0010_NAR	Cereza tried to put on a tough face,\nbut she was ashamed to have\nbeen saved by the demon yet again.
SM_002040_0020_NAR	Cheshire had expected as much.\nHe sat and watched the wisps\nwith an uninterested expression.
SM_002040_0040_NAR	[FONT:9 ]What was the point of saving \nthese things again?[FONT:N ]\nCheshire asked flatly.
SM_002040_0050_CER	“Look how happy they are.\nColm and his friends can live\ntogether again.\nMaybe find some solace in\nthis forsaken forest...”
SM_002040_0070_NAR	[FONT:9 ]Who cares about them?[FONT:N ]\nreplied Cheshire.\nDemons are not known for\ntheir altruism.
SM_002040_0080_CER	“What are you saying?\nYou would just abandon them?”
SM_002040_0090_CER	“Don't you know what it feels like\nto be torn from someone you love?”
SM_002040_0100_NAR	But as she said these words\nCereza realised something...
SM_002040_0110_CER	“Oh...I suppose...\nI tore you apart from those you love \nwhen I called you to this world...”
SM_002040_0120_NAR	[FONT:9 ]I was just born.\nThere's nobody I love.\nNo need for love. Only strength.[FONT:N ]\nThe demon's philosophy was simple.
SM_002040_0130_CER	“You were just born?\nThen you...”
SM_002040_0150_NAR	[FONT:9 ]I'm this strong as a newborn!\nJust imagine when I grow![FONT:N ]\nThe demon interrupted Cereza's\nintrospection with rapturous laughter.
SM_002040_0170_CER	“I-I'm going to be strong too!\nBut I'm going to do it with style,\nunlike some creatures I could name!”
SM_002040_0180_CER	“If I had been stronger\nI could have saved her that night...”\n
SM_002040_0190_NAR	As she spoke, visions of the night she\nfailed to save her mother flashed\nbefore Cereza's eyes.
SM_002050_0000_COL	“Thank you Cereza!”
SM_002050_0010_NAR	Colm was chuffed.\nHe told them he wanted to show\nhis thanks for saving his friends.
SM_002050_0020_COL	“Follow me!”
SM_002060_0000_COL	“This is our secret base.\nUsually it's strictly wisps only,\nbut I'll make an exception.”
SM_002060_0010_COL	“Hey, where'd your kitty friend go?”
SM_002060_0030_CER	“Careful, Cheshire!\nI don't know if wisps can have\nheart attacks, but scares like\nthat can't be good either way.”
SM_002060_0040_NAR	[FONT:9 ]I couldn't care less about\nweaklings like him. [FONT:N ]
SM_002060_0050_NAR	[FONT:9 ]We have a job to do.\nNo time to play fort with \nthese pipsqueaks,[FONT:N ]\nsaid Cheshire, as he eyed Colm.\n
SM_002060_0060_COL	“Why, someone's a grumpy cat!\nI have something for you too!”
SM_002060_0070_NAR	[FONT:9 ]You think a demon's hunger\nis so easily satiated?[FONT:N ]\nBut the drool dripping from the\ndemon's maw betrayed his cool exterior.
SM_002060_0080_CER	“I think this is the happiest\nhe's been in a while, thanks.”
SM_002060_0090_COL	“And for you, I have this.\nWe don't know how to use it,\nbut it seems to have some kind of magic.”
SM_002060_0100_CER	“Thank you!”
SM_002060_0110_COL	“Cereza, you look tired.\nWe're safe here, so why don't \nyou take a little rest?”
SM_002060_0120_CER	“Now that you mention it...\nI have been on edge ever since\ncoming to this forest.\n\nThanks for everything, Colm.”
SM_002060_0130_COL	“Don't mention it! Let me\nknow if you need anything else.”
SM_002060_0140_NAR	With that, Colm ran off\nto frolic with his ethereal chums.
BK_2010_0010_CER	“Why...why won't it open?”
BK_2010_0020_CER	“M-Mummy? \nWhere are you Mummy?”
BK_2010_0040_LUC	“Dry your tears...”
BK_2010_0050_LUC	“You are stronger than you know...\nYour desire to save others\nwill give you strength...” 
BK_2010_0060_LUC	“A mother's warm embrace...\nYou will feel it again. As will I...”
SM_002100_0000_CER	“As will I...”
SM_002100_0010_NAR	The boy's final words were\nstill ringing in her ears.
SM_002100_0020_NAR	Cereza's chest felt warm.\nAs if in this dark, cold forest,\na flame had been lit \ndeep in her heart.
SM_002100_0030_CER	I wonder when I'll see him again...\n
SM_002100_0040_NAR	Just thinking about her next dream,\nCereza couldn't help but smile.
SM_002100_0050_CER	“The white wolf!”
SM_002100_0060_NAR	At the sight of the wolf,\nCereza jumped to her feet.
SM_002100_0070_CER	“Cheshire, you're all fuelled up, \nright?”
SM_002100_0090_COL	“Awww, you're leaving already?”\n
SM_002100_0100_CER	“Sorry, we're in a hurry.”
SM_002100_0110_COL	“Can I trouble you with \none last request?”
SM_002100_0120_COL	“If you find any more of my\nfriends captured in the forest,\nwould you be so kind as to save\nthem and send them back here?”
SM_002100_0130_COL	“We'll make it worth your while,\nI promise!”
SM_002100_0140_CER	“You have my word!”
SM_002100_0150_COL	“Thank you!”
SM_002100_0160_NAR	Saying farewell to Colm,\nthey resumed their chase.\nThe white wolf was just ahead!
SM_002100_0170_COL	“Take care Cereza, take care kitty!”
BK_2000_0020_NAR	A massive faerie took them by surprise.\nOnce again, Cereza was petrified \nwith fear.
BK_2000_0040_NAR	[FONT:9 ]Get out of the way![FONT:N ]\nCheshire yelled at the terrified Cereza.
BK_2000_0050_CER	“I-I can fight! \nDon't treat me like a helpless child!”
BK_2000_0060_CER	“Come on Cereza, get it together.\nI'm going...I'm going to be a witch!”
SM_002080_0000_NAR	They had defeated the formidable faerie.\nIf only slightly, Cereza felt that\nshe had made a difference.
SM_002080_0010_CER	“Not bad, huh?\nTold you I'm good for more\nthan just carrying you around.”
SM_002080_0020_NAR	But Cheshire was not impressed.
SM_002080_0030_CER	“Hmph, you stuck-up demon!”
SM_002080_0040_NAR	Cereza was fed up with\nCheshire's arrogant attitude.
BK_8100_0000_CER	“It's just like before...”
BK_8100_0010_CER	“I know, hold on.\nI wonder what power you'll\nget this time...”
SM_002130_0000_FAS	“Hello there, miss.”
SM_002130_0010_CER	“W-who's there!?”
SM_002130_0020_NAR	Cereza's heart leapt at the sudden voice.
SM_002130_0030_FAS	“Good question. Let's just say...\nI'm the one you talk to when you want \nto know about the goings-on in this forest.”
SM_002130_0040_FAS	“Well, I'm not a faerie at least.\nTake my word on that one.”
SM_002130_0050_CER	“...Says the creepy voice from the shadows.”
SM_002130_0060_FAS	“Try asking me something \nif you don't believe me.\nI'll answer any question you have.”
SM_002130_0070_CER	“Okay...Umm...\nHave you seen any wh-black wolves...\naround the forest lately?”
SM_002130_0080_FAS	“Oh, but you're looking for \na white wolf, aren't you?”
SM_002130_0090_CER	“H-how did you know...?”
SM_002130_0100_FAS	“You are a part of this forest now.\nThat means your business \nhas become my business.”
SM_002130_0110_FAS	“Trust in the path you take now...\nIt's the right one.”
SM_002130_0120_FAS	“But you won't be able to find \nthose Elemental Cores \nas easy as you think.”
SM_002130_0130_CER	“You know about the Elemental Cores too!?”
SM_002130_0135_CER	“Okay...Tell me more.”
SM_002130_0140_FAS	“Ahead, there is an old circus \ntent faeries use to lure human \nchildren into the forest.”
SM_002130_0150_FAS	“The crazed ringmaster\nenslaves poor souls there to perform \nin his shows until they die.”
SM_002130_0160_CER	“Until they...die?”
SM_002130_0170_FAS	“My apologies...Was that too scary?”
SM_002130_0180_FAS	“But you needn't worry. \nYou and that demon of yours \nwon't croak that easily.”
SM_002130_0190_FAS	“You've caused a big ruckus \namong those faeries \nsince you entered this forest.”
SM_002130_0200_FAS	“That just proves they're scared of you.\nAnd that demon, of course...”
SM_002130_0210_FAS	“Well, I'm afraid I must go.\nI wish you both safe travels.”
SM_002130_0220_NAR	The voice faded away\nand silence once again enveloped the forest.
SM_002130_0230_CER	“And...she's gone.”
SM_002130_0240_CER	“Just who was that...?”
_05	
SM_002140_0000_FAS	“Have fun at the circus?”
SM_002140_0010_CER	“That voice...”
SM_002140_0020_NAR	A familiar voice once again \nechoed through the trees.
SM_002140_0030_NAR	Cereza looked in the voice's \ndirection to see a strange wisp, \nburied deep in a cap.
SM_002140_0040_CER	“A wisp?”
SM_002140_0045_CER	“So you're the one who \ntalked to us back there!”
SM_002140_0050_FAS	“You know, I haven't introduced myself.\nMy name is Ignis, \nthe keeper of this forest.”
SM_002140_0060_FAS	“Good on you for taking \ncare of that circus.\nI knew I was right about you.”
SM_002140_0070_FAS	“Something tells me \nthat ringmaster won't be \nenjoying his trapeze any more.”
SM_002140_0080_FAS	“A pity.”
SM_002140_0090_CER	“He was an absolute brute!\nPlay a bit part in someone else's show?\nNo thanks!”
SM_002140_0100_NAR	Knowing this voice belonged \nto a wisp put Cereza \ninfinitely more at ease.
SM_002140_0110_NAR	But Cheshire said not a word.\nHe seemed to have \nno interest in the wisp at all.
SM_002140_0120_CER	“You said your name was Ignis, right?”
SM_002140_0130_CER	“Ignis, you wouldn't happen to know \nwhere we can find the remaining\nElemental Cores...would you?”
SM_002140_0140_FAS	“Of course.\nThe next core is at \nthe bottom of the lake.”
SM_002140_0150_CER	“The bottom of the lake?!”
SM_002140_0160_CER	“Well, I suppose that's lucky.\nI was always better at sinking than swimming.”
SM_002140_0170_CER	“...The problem is coming back up again.”
SM_002140_0180_FAS	“No need to worry.\nJust drain the water!”
SM_002140_0190_FAS	“But you'll have to go over \na towering tree in order to \nget there. To get to the bottom \nof a lake, you need to climb \nthe tallest tree in the forest. \nIsn't that poetic?”
SM_002140_0200_CER	“The tallest tree, huh...”
SM_002140_0210_FAS	“Something the matter?”
SM_002140_0220_CER	“Nope, not a thing!\nClock towers...giant statues...\nYes, witches love high places!\nThanks for your help!”
SM_002140_0230_FAS	“You're very welcome.”

LV_002005_0010_CER	What could that be?
LV_002005_0020_NAR	Cereza spotted something that looked like fruit.
LV_002005_0030_NAR	[FONT:10 ]Looks good. Quick, let's go get it![FONT:N ]
LV_002010_0010_CER	One of those wisps\nis being bullied...But...\nI can't help them by myself...

LV_002030_0010_CER	This new power...
LV_002030_0020_CER	Maybe we can use it to go to places we couldn't before!
LV_002035_0010_NAR	[FONT:10 ]My tongue is for lickin' prey.\nHow long are you gonna make me do this?[FONT:N ]
LV_002035_0015_NAR	Cheshire said in a bitter tone.
LV_002035_0020_CER	You'd think your tongue was for complaining\nwith the fuss you're making.\nYou want to go home, don't you?
LV_002035_0110_NAR	[FONT:10 ]Hmph, you just can't do anything without me![FONT:N ]
LV_002035_0115_NAR	Cheshire scowled at Cereza menacingly.
LV_002035_0120_CER	Oh, stop! Don't forget whose elemental \nmagic you use to transform like that!
LV_002040_0010_CER	What is this place...?\nSome kind of faerie playground?
LV_002040_0020_CER	Could...humans have been here?
LV_002040_0030_CER	I wish I could've played \nwith Mummy at a place like this.
LV_002045_0010_NAR	Can't get inside unless we lower that drawbridge.
LV_002050_0010_CER	I've got to be careful.\nIf they spot me, I'll be in trouble.
LV_002055_0010_NAR	Saving the wisps brought a small joy to Cereza's heart.
LV_002055_0020_CER	Those faeries are just awful.\nDon't fear, wisps! I'll save you!
LV_002065_0010_CER	You walk fast for someone \nwith such short legs, Colm.
LV_002065_0110_CER	To be honest, until meeting you I\nthought wisps were just a tall tale.
LV_002070_0010_NAR	Cereza squealed in delight. She was still a child, after all.
LV_002080_0010_CER	
LV_002080_0020_NAR	Cereza suddenly let out a yawn. She was exhausted.
LV_002080_0030_NAR	She decided to rest here for a bit.
LV_002085_0010_NAR	Cereza set off further into the forest.
LV_002085_0020_NAR	She enjoyed playing with the wisps, \nbut her journey was far from over.
LV_002090_0010_CER	What is that?
LV_002090_0020_NAR	In the distance stood a massive tent dyed the colour of fresh blood.\nIt seemed to taunt Cereza, drawing her towards it.
LV_002095_0010_CER	I saw this act at a fair once.\nNever thought I'd be the one performing...

BK_3020_0000_NAR	The monster's wings were\nhard as steel. Cheshire's claws\nseemed like toys by comparison.
BK_3020_0010_NAR	It had found a new target.\nCereza knew she must fight,\nbut she was petrified with fear.
BK_3020_0050_NAR	Like a hawk hunting mice, \nthe draconic faerie searched for its prey.
BK_3020_0060_NAR	Cheshire tried desperately to transform, \nbut with Cereza's magic in flux from fear,\nhis body remained tiny.
BK_3020_0080_NAR	[FONT:9 ]You pathetic weakling![FONT:N ]\nThe cuddly body did not take\nthe edge off his harsh words.
BK_3020_0090_NAR	Giving in to her fear,\nCereza scooped up Cheshire, and ran.
SM_003010_0000_NAR	They had escaped with their lives,\nbut Cheshire was furious at \nCereza for her cowardly retreat.
SM_003010_0010_CER	“...”
SM_003010_0020_NAR	Cereza stood silently, fists clenched.\nMore than anything, she was angry \nat herself for once again \nsuccumbing to her fear.
SM_003010_0030_CER	“Cheshire's attacks didn't \nmake so much as a dent in\nthat monster's armour...\n\nW-what am I going to do?”
SM_003010_0040_NAR	For once, Cheshire had \nno mocking retort.
SM_003010_0050_NAR	He remembered the battle.\nThis was the first time \nhe had tasted defeat\nand he did not like it one bit.
SM_003010_0060_NAR	[FONT:9 ]Just stay out of my way![FONT:N ]\nwas all the demon could muster.
SM_003010_0070_CER	“...”
SM_003010_0080_NAR	Lost in despair of her own,\nCereza barely heard his words.\n
BK_3030_0000_NAR	They found themselves face to face\nwith the monster once again. 
BK_3030_0010_NAR	[FONT:9 ]Go hide somewhere![FONT:N ]\nyelled Cheshire, preparing for battle.
BK_3030_0020_NAR	Half by instinct, Cereza found\nher way to a hiding spot.\nWithout a moment of hesitation,\nCheshire threw himself at the enemy.
BK_3030_0040_NAR	His claws found their mark, \nbut once again left \nthe beast unperturbed.
BK_3030_0050_NAR	Cheshire continued his fierce \nassault, but with each exchange \nhe was gradually losing ground.
BK_3030_0070_CER	\n“Cheshire!”
BK_3030_0080_NAR	It was only a matter of time before\nCheshire was overwhelmed.\nIs this how our tale ends...?
BK_3030_0090_CER	“I-I can't...”
BK_3030_0100_CER	“I still...can't save anyone...”
BK_3030_0110_CER	“No, not this time!”
BK_3030_0120_CER	“No more running away!”
BK_3030_0130_CER	“I am going to be a witch.\nI need to be strong!”
PH_3020_0000_CER	There's got to be something\nI can do to save him!
PH_3020_0010_CER	There!
SM_003020_0000_NAR	With its armour in tatters\nthe dragon turned tail and fled.
SM_003020_0020_CER	“Cheshire, are you okay? \nAny serious injuries?”
SM_003020_0030_NAR	Cheshire only shook his head,\nlest his voice betray the fact\nthat he was shaken.
SM_003020_0040_CER	“Oh, thank goodness...”
SM_003020_0050_CER	“I wonder if that faerie will be back.\nBut now we know it's not \ncompletely invincible!”
SM_003020_0060_NAR	Invigorated from the battle,\nCereza was almost confident.\nCheshire was in a sour mood.
SM_003020_0070_NAR	A part of him realised that if it\nwere not for Cereza's actions,\nhe would currently be dragon food.\n\nBut he just could not accept \nthat he had been saved by someone\nhe considered so far beneath him.
SM_003020_0080_CER	“If I'm going to be an Umbra Witch,\nI can't be afraid of an \novergrown lizard like that. \nWe'll get him next time, Cheshire!”
SM_003020_0090_NAR	As she said these words\nCheshire noticed something \nin Cereza not present in the timid\ngirl he had met earlier.
SM_003020_0100_NAR	The prideful demon turned away,\nand pretended not to hear her.\n
BK_3000_0000_NAR	Munch, Munch...
BK_3000_0010_CER	“The monster!”
BK_3000_0020_NAR	The time had come to settle the\nscore once and for all.
BK_3000_0030_CER	“You don't scare me...\nNot any more!”
SM_003030_0000_NAR	The vile Jabberwock had been defeated;\nCereza was ecstatic.
SM_003030_0010_NAR	Cheshire turned away.\nHe seemed almost as down as\nafter their last encounter with the monster.
SM_003030_0020_CER	“What're you sulking \nabout this time? We won!”
SM_003030_0030_NAR	Cheshire started grumbling about\nhow Cereza moving around the \nbattlefield made it hard to fight.\n
SM_003030_0050_NAR	Cereza's celebration had been ruined\nbefore it could even begin.
SM_003030_0060_CER	“You do realise it was thanks to my help\nyou were able to defeat that thing, right?\nYou could at least say a word of thanks!”
SM_003030_0080_CER	“Ah!”
SM_003030_0090_NAR	Putting their argument on pause,\nthey ran to keep up\nwith the white wolf.
BK_8110_0000_CER	“Another element!”
BK_8110_0010_CER	“What's wrong?\nNot even interested in getting\na new power any more?”
BK_8110_0030_CER	“Yeah, this won't get you home either,\nbut I'm sure it will help us get closer!”\n
SM_003035_0000_LUC	“My, you managed to defeat \nthe ferocious Jabberwock.\nIt's hard to believe you are\nthe same girl who I found sobbing\nall alone in a dark nightmare.\nYou truly have grown strong.”
SM_003035_0010_CER	“R-really? Thanks...”
SM_003035_0020_CER	“You know,\nyou still haven't told me your name.”
SM_003035_0030_LUC	“I am Lukaon. \nAnd you?”
SM_003035_0040_CER	“I'm Cereza.”
SM_003035_0050_LUC	“Cereza...what a lovely name...”
SM_003035_0060_CER	“Lukaon, who are you?\nWhy are you doing \nso much to help me?”
SM_003035_0070_LUC	“I am trapped deep in the heart \nof this forest by a powerful curse.”
SM_003035_0080_LUC	“But as a witch, \nI believe you have the power\nto break that curse.”
SM_003035_0085_LUC	“What's more...”
SM_003035_0090_CER	“What is it?”
SM_003035_0100_LUC	“Your dream...\nYou long to save your mother, don't you?\n\nThat particular sorrow \nis one I know all too well.”
SM_003035_0110_CER	“You are also trying to find\nyour mother, aren't you?”
SM_003035_0120_LUC	“Yes...even after countless moons my mother\nstill waits for me outside the forest.”
SM_003035_0130_LUC	“I want to go to her, to dry her tears!”
SM_003035_0140_LUC	“Cereza, please break my curse.\nIf you destroy the final Elemental Core\nand come to the heart of the forest,\nmy dream...our dream will become a reality!”
SM_003035_0150_LUC	“We can leave this forest together.\nI will help you save your mother,\nand we can all live as \nfamilies once again!”
SM_003035_0160_CER	“Lukaon...\nI understand...I'll do my best!”
SM_003035_0170_CER	“I want to know more about you.\nThere is so much we have in common!”\n
SM_003035_0180_LUC	“I feel the same way.\nI have never met another who\nunderstood my pain...shared my dream...”
SM_003040_0000_NAR	Another meeting with Lukaon.\nRemembering the dream sent\nCereza's young heart aflutter.
SM_003040_0010_NAR	Cheshire noticed\nCereza's flushed cheeks\nand stared at her inquisitively.
SM_003040_0020_CER	“Hmm?\n Oh, it's nothing.\n\nAnyways, there is something \nI should explain while I have the chance.”
SM_003040_0040_NAR	Cereza told Cheshire the reason she\nhad entered Avalon Forest.\nLukaon appearing in her dream;\nher quest to save her mother;\nand the power she was promised,\nthat waited at the heart of the forest.
SM_003040_0060_NAR	Cheshire was speechless.\nEntering the forest based on a\nhalf-remembered promise\nfrom a boy in a dream?!
SM_003040_0070_CER	“I-I know what it sounds like,\nbut it's all coming true!\nThe Elemental Cores were just as\nLukaon said, right?\nThese are more than mere dreams!”
SM_003040_0080_NAR	If he did not return to Inferno soon,\nCheshire would surely die.\nThe thought that he was chasing\nthe whims of a love-struck child\nsent his blood boiling with rage.
SM_003040_0090_NAR	[FONT:9 ]If I don't make it back to Inferno,\nthe last thing I do in this\nmiserable world will be\ntearing you limb from limb![FONT:N ]\nroared the furious demon.
SM_003040_0100_CER	“Lukaon could teach you a thing \nor two about how to talk to a lady...”
SM_003040_0110_CER	“Nothing!\nCome on, let's go find that Core.”
SM_003050_0000_MOR	“Cereza, thank Sheba you're safe.”
SM_003050_0010_NAR	Morgana's projection appeared \nbefore her once again.\n\nShe seemed relieved.\n
SM_003050_0020_MOR	“Cereza, you look...different.\nDid something happen, my dear?”
SM_003050_0030_CER	“Morgana, I defeated a giant monster!\nYou should have seen it!”
SM_003050_0040_NAR	Unable to contain her childish glee,\nCereza explained how they had\ntaken down the Jabberwock.
SM_003050_0050_MOR	“It is a miracle you escaped unscathed.\nI thought I told you to find a safe\nplace and stay put!”
SM_003050_0060_MOR	“...But I must admit I am surprised.\nPerhaps you have grown more\nthan I thought.”
SM_003050_0070_NAR	Words of praise from Morgana\nwere as rare as igloos in Inferno.\nIt took all of Cereza's willpower\nnot to jump for joy.
SM_003050_0080_MOR	“I believe you are ready \nfor more powerful magic techniques.\n\nThey will allow you to draw\nout the true strength of your familiar.”
SM_003050_0090_MOR	“Listen Cereza, I have begun my\npreparations to get you out of that forest.”
SM_003050_0100_CER	“What?”
SM_003050_0110_MOR	“The strength of the faerie magic that \nprotects Avalon is immense.\nIt will require an equally\npowerful spell to break.\n\nI have begun my incantation,\nbut it will take until dawn to complete...\nYou must survive until then.”
SM_003050_0120_CER	“Y-yes ma'am!”
SM_003050_0130_MOR	“Skill at controlling a demon\ndetermines one's worth as a witch.”\n
SM_003050_0140_MOR	“Remember this if you hope to \ntake on any more monsters\nin that forest and live to tell the tale.”
SM_003050_0150_NAR	After Morgana's spectre had vanished,\nCheshire let out an angry growl.
SM_003050_0170_CER	“Oh, Morgana always talks like that.\nDon't worry, I know you're\nnot just some kind of weapon.\n\nBut, it wouldn't kill you to listen\nto my advice once in a while.”
SM_003050_0180_NAR	Cheshire snorted in response.\n
SM_003050_0200_CER	“Ugh, you're hopeless!”
SM_003050_0210_NAR	And with that,\nCereza's good mood disappeared \nas quickly as it had come.
SM_003080_0000_FAS	“Well, who do we have here.\nFrankly, I'm surprised \nyou've made it this far.”
SM_003080_0010_FAS	“You even took care of the \nmonstrous Jabberwock,\nviolent even by faerie standards.”
SM_003080_0020_FAS	“I never expected a witch \nto come along and beat him.”
SM_003080_0030_FAS	“And you've destroyed \nanother Elemental Core, \nbut you don't seem happy?”
SM_003080_0040_FAS	“You're not hurt, are you?”
SM_003080_0050_CER	“No, we're fine.”
SM_003080_0060_CER	“Hey, how about telling us where \nto find the last Elemental Core!”
SM_003080_0070_CER	“You know, don't you?”
SM_003080_0080_FAS	“Miss...I've often said, \nhurrying will get you nowhere.”
SM_003080_0090_CER	“You sound like my teacher!”
SM_003080_0100_CER	“Come on, don't hold out on us!”
SM_003080_0110_FAS	“Dear, dear...”
SM_003080_0120_FAS	“The final Elemental Core...\nis in a particularly tricky \npart of this forest.”
SM_003080_0130_FAS	“Inside a fortress where \nonly the most malicious \nof the faeries reside.”
SM_003080_0140_FAS	“No one who has entered that \nfortress has ever made it out.\nStill sure you want to go?”
SM_003080_0150_CER	“Oh, we'll go all right!\nI'm a witch. And I'm way stronger now\nthan when I set foot in this forest.”
SM_003080_0160_FAS	“We can hope...”
SM_003080_0170_FAS	“But with your teamwork, \nmaybe you don't have \nmuch to worry about?”
SM_003080_0180_FAS	“I'm tired of those cruel \nfaeries myself. I'm hoping you \ncan show them what's what!”
SM_003080_0190_FAS	“I know the secret \npathways of this forest.”
SM_003080_0200_FAS	“I may be able to take you \nto somewhere you've been before.”
SM_003080_0210_FAS	“If you'd like me to guide you, \njust ask me any time.”
SM_003080_0220_FAS	“Think of it as showing \nmy gratitude for taking \ncare of those pesky faeries.”

LV_003005_0000_CER	What is this...?\n
LV_003005_0010_CER	Was someone watching us...
LV_003010_0000_CER	Hey, this looks familiar.
LV_003010_0010_NAR	They had been here before.\nTheir trek around the forest had \nbrought them back to their starting point.
LV_003015_0000_CER	Okay, wow, that's high.\nIt'll be fine. Just don't. Look. Down.
LV_003020_0000_CER	Are these...claw marks?
LV_003020_0010_CER	No way...nothing has claws this big...right?
LV_003025_0000_NAR	An ancient tree, long felled,\nbared its fangs at Cereza.
LV_003025_0010_NAR	Cereza could not shake the feeling that\nAvalon Forest itself conspired against her.
LV_003030_0000_CER	What was that?!
LV_003035_0000_NAR	[FONT:10 ]You want to find the next Elemental Core, right? Get going then![FONT:N ]
LV_003035_0010_NAR	Cheshire growled for Cereza to go.
LV_003035_0020_NAR	But Cereza could not muster the strength to say anything back.
LV_003040_0000_NAR	Cereza could just make out the Water Shrine \nin the distance. Before it stood a strange \ncontraption built from thick metal pipes.
LV_003040_0010_NAR	It was a cage, big enough to swallow up\nMorgana's manor whole.
LV_003045_0000_NAR	[FONT:10 ]Next time that thing shows its ugly mug\nI'm going to beat it to a pulp![FONT:N ]
LV_003045_0010_NAR	Cheshire shouted his bravado so Cereza would hear.
LV_003045_0020_NAR	It did little to quell her worry.
LV_003045_0030_CER	I...I...
LV_003050_0000_CER	I wonder if we're in that monster's territory. 
LV_003050_0010_NAR	As the words came out, Cereza was gripped by fear.
LV_003050_0020_NAR	But she knew it was too late to turn back.
LV_003055_0000_CER	We're getting closer...\nIt's nearby, I know it.
LV_003060_0000_CER	I have to help Cheshire!
LV_003060_0010_CER	There has to be something I can do.
LV_003065_0000_CER	This looks like a piece of its hide...\nSo it's not completely invincible! 
LV_003070_0000_CER	I won't run any more.\nCome on, Cheshire!
LV_003070_0010_NAR	[FONT:10 ]Like I'd turn around now.[FONT:N ]
LV_003070_0020_NAR	Cheshire grumbled under his breath.\nHe was itching for a fight.
LV_003075_0000_NAR	Broken cages were scattered everywhere.
LV_003075_0010_CER	Look at all of them...
LV_003075_0020_NAR	What were these cages for...? Cereza started to wonder, then decided it'd be best not to know.
LV_003080_0000_CER	The white wolf!\nGlad to see you're safe.
LV_003080_0010_CER	Please! \nTake me to the last Elemental Core.
CE_003000_0000_CER	Come on, let me help!
CE_003010_0000_CER	Cheshire! \nLet's use your stone elemental power!
CE_003020_0000_CER	Ah-!
CE_003020_0010_CER	Ugh!
CE_003030_0000_CER	Uh oh, what now?\nI think we made it mad?
CE_003040_0000_CER	Cheshire!!!
CE_003040_0010_CER	I have to help him!
CE_003050_0000_CER	Eat up now...\nUntil that big belly of yours bursts!
LV_003900_0000_CER	Woooo!\nI'm flying!
LV_003905_0000_CER	Ugh...no good.\nHe's too strong!
LV_003905_0010_NAR	The monster's body was hard as steel.\nCheshire let out a frustrated growl.
LV_003910_0000_CES	Running away from everything.\nIs that how you plan to become a witch?
LV_003910_0020_CER	I don't...want to run any more!
LV_003910_0030_CES	You're scared, aren't you?\nJust go cry in the corner, you coward!
LV_003910_0040_CER	I...I want to be stronger!
LV_003910_0050_CES	What can you possibly do?\nEveryone knows you're a failure.
LV_003910_0060_CER	Mummy...Mummy believed in me!
LV_003915_0000_NAR	Cereza held back her tears,\npushing herself forward with all her might.
LV_003915_0010_NAR	I can't cry...I've got to be strong!\nShe whispered to herself quietly, \nso that Cheshire would not hear.
CE_003800_0000_CER	That looks like it would hurt...\nFocus! Got to keep moving!
LV_003920_0000_CER	I...no...I can't...
LV_003920_0010_CER	W-what?!
LV_003920_0020_CER	Ahh...\nNo more...\nBe quiet!
LV_003920_0030_NAR	[FONT:10 ]Get ahold of yourself! Move![FONT:N ]\ngrowled the demon, \ntrying to shake Cereza from her stupor. 
CE_003805_0000_CER	That...that might work!
Text/Episode4
BK_4000_0000_NAR	Cereza and Cheshire were not alone.\nGlowing eyes watched from the shadows.
BK_4000_0010_NAR	Whispering an enchantment,\nthe faeries made their move.
BK_4000_0020_ROS	“Cer...Cereza...”
BK_4000_0030_CER	“Who's there?”
BK_4000_0040_NAR	How could this be?\nBefore Cereza stood her mother.
BK_4000_0050_CER	“Mummy? Is it really you?”
BK_4000_0055_ROS	“Yes, my dearest Cereza. \nCome, this way...”
IN_40000_0010_NAR	Cereza was drawn forward\ntowards the apparition.
IN_40000_0020_NAR	Desperate to reach her mother,\nshe walked faster and faster.
BK_4090_0010_CER	“I'm coming Mummy,\ndon't leave me again!”
BK_4090_0040_NAR	The shade vanished, \nwith a blood-chilling scream \nthat echoed through the trees.
SM_004010_0010_CER	“Mummy!”
SM_004010_0020_NAR	Cheshire's strike had\nshattered the illusion,\nbut it had taken a \nfrightful toll on Cereza.
SM_004010_0030_NAR	She collapsed to her knees,\nher mother's final scream\nstill ringing in her ears.
SM_004010_0040_NAR	Cheshire glanced down at Cereza.\nHe told her to hurry and get \na move on.
SM_004010_0060_NAR	...But the tears would not stop.\n
SM_004010_0070_NAR	[FONT:9 ]Come on! If I hadn't dealt with\nthat shade you'd be face-down \nat the bottom of that cliff![FONT:N ]\n\nWith each passing moment the\ndemon became increasingly annoyed.
SM_004010_0080_CER	“Cheshire, how could you?\nHow could you do that to her!?”
SM_004010_0100_NAR	Unable to take Cheshire's abuse\nany longer, Cereza leapt to her feet.\n\nBehind her tears, \nCereza's eyes burned with fury.
SM_004010_0110_NAR	[FONT:9 ]I save you, and this is the thanks I get?\nMaybe if you weren't so helpless,\nI wouldn't need to fight all your battles![FONT:N ]\n\nCheshire was not about to back down.\n
SM_004010_0120_CER	“Why am I not surprised...\nI wouldn't expect a demon like you\nto understand anyway!”
SM_004010_0130_CER	“And just so we're clear,\nyou say I'm weak, but you can't survive\nwithout me either, remember!?”
SM_004010_0140_NAR	[FONT:9 ]Look at you! You wouldn't last five\nminutes in this forest without me![FONT:N ]\n\nTheir fight was quickly reaching \nits boiling point.
SM_004010_0150_NAR	Then came the straw that\nbroke the demon's back.
SM_004010_0160_CER	“Don't forget who summoned you here!\nWhy don't you just behave like\na proper demon, and do as I say!”
SM_004010_0170_NAR	Cheshire's eyes narrowed.\nFor a second, he was quiet.
LV_004010_0003_CER	Mummy!
BK_4070_0000_NAR	Cheshire broke the silence with a threatening growl.
BK_4070_0010_CER	”I wish I'd never summoned you!”
BK_4070_0030_CER	“Good! That's it, we're through!”
BK_4070_0040_NAR	Cereza's final words echoed off the trees. \nThen all was still.
SM_004020_0000_CER	“Who needs Cheshire anyway.\nI can take care of myself!”
SM_004020_0010_CER	“And don't come crying to me when\nyour magic runs out!”
SM_004020_0020_CER	“Cheshire?”
SM_004020_0030_NAR	No answer.\n
SM_004020_0040_NAR	The hairs on the back of her neck stood up.\nThe suspense built, until...\n\n
SM_004020_0060_NAR	...A small bunny rabbit\nemerged from the bushes.\nCereza breathed a sigh of relief. 
SM_004020_0070_CER	“G-good try Avalon, but\nit'll take more to scare this witch.”
SM_004020_0075_CER	“Now then, where did that wolf get to!”
SM_004030_0010_NAR	Cereza had certainly grown \nstronger since entering the forest.\nBut even so, making her way alone \nwas proving more difficult \nthan expected.
SM_004030_0020_NAR	If only Cheshire were here...
SM_004030_0030_CER	“No, I'm better off without that beast!\nI can make it through this forest myself!”
SM_004030_0040_NAR	Cereza heard a familiar voice.\nIt was Cheshire.\n\nInjured, he was fleeing from\na group of faeries.
SM_004030_0050_CER	“Hmph, not my problem!”
SM_004035_0000_NAR	Somehow Cereza had made it through.\nSolo adventuring was turning out\nmuch more difficult than she had anticipated.
SM_004035_0010_NAR	The optimism she had right after splitting\nup with Cheshire was long gone.
SM_004035_0020_NAR	Speaking of Cheshire...\nCereza couldn't help remembering him.
SM_004040_0000_NAR	Cereza once again spotted Cheshire.\n\nIncapacitated by his wounds,\nhe was surrounded by faeries.
SM_004040_0010_CER	“What has he gotten himself into now...\n...Nope, not going to worry about it!”
SM_004040_0020_NAR	But before she knew what she was doing,\nCereza had set off in Cheshire's direction.\n
SM_004040_0030_CER	I'm just going to take a look.\nCan't let anything happen to my stuffed cat.
SM_004050_0000_CER	“Who is he talking to...?”
SM_004050_0010_NAR	The faeries had captured Cheshire.\nWithin their ranks was one \nregal-looking faerie who stood out\nfrom all the others.
SM_004050_0020_NAR	He appeared to be talking to \nCheshire, but it was too far to hear\nwhat he was saying.
SM_004050_0030_CER	“What does that faerie want with Cheshire?”
SM_004050_0040_NAR	The faeries carried him\ninto some kind of fortress.
SM_004050_0050_CER	“Cheshire...”
SM_004050_0060_NAR	Forgetting the peril of her situation,\nCereza rushed to follow the\nfaeries into their stronghold.
SM_004050_0070_CER	“No good...\nThere must be another way in.”
SM_004050_0090_CER	“You!”
SM_004050_0100_NAR	The elusive white wolf had \nappeared right before Cereza.
SM_004050_0110_NAR	It called out to her before\nrunning away.
SM_004050_0115_NAR	When Cereza followed,\nshe found the wolf standing before\na small hole that opened into the fortress.
SM_004050_0120_NAR	The hole was just big enough for\nan apprentice witch to fit through.
SM_004050_0125_CER	“This should allow me to get in\nwithout being discovered by those\npesky faeries. Thank you!”\n
SM_004050_0130_CER	“Be careful!”
SM_004060_0000_CER	“Listen, this fortress\nis crawling with faeries.\nI think you should sit this one out.”
SM_004060_0010_NAR	But the wolf just stared at her,\nshowing no signs of moving.\n\nLet's go together!\nThe wolf's determined eyes\nseemed to be saying to her.
SM_004060_0020_CER	“Thanks...\nYou know, to be honest,\nI was a little scared going alone.”
SM_004060_0025_CER	“...Don't tell Cheshire I said that.”
SM_004060_0030_NAR	And so,\nCereza and the white wolf infiltrated\ndeep into the enemy stronghold.\n
SM_004070_0000_CER	“Cheshire!”
SM_004070_0010_NAR	They had finally found Cheshire.\nHe was covered in wounds\nfrom head to toe.
SM_004070_0020_NAR	Hiding in the shadows, Cereza was \nsurprised to hear one of the faeries \nspeaking words she understood.
SM_004070_0030_NAR	[FONT:9 ]It is simple:\nwe just need the girl...[FONT:N ]
SM_004070_0040_NAR	[FONT:9 ]Stay out of our way and we will\nensure your return to the demon realm![FONT:N ]
SM_004070_0050_NAR	They were speaking Enochian,\nthe language of angels and demons.\nIt sounded like the regal faerie was\ntrying to strike a deal with Cheshire.
SM_004070_0060_NAR	Cereza felt her heart beating in her chest.
SM_004070_0070_NAR	[FONT:9 ]What will it be?\nThis is your last chance, demon![FONT:N ]
SM_004070_0080_NAR	Cereza waited for his answer\nwith bated breath.
SM_004070_0090_NAR	Then she heard the familiar\ndeep growl...
SM_004070_0100_NAR	[FONT:9 ]Like I can trust a faerie!\nI'll devour every last one of you![FONT:N ]
SM_004070_0110_NAR	Despite his battered body,\nCheshire's eyes still \nsmouldered with defiance.
SM_004070_0120_CER	“Cheshire!”
SM_004070_0130_NAR	Cereza had jumped out without\nan action plan of any sort.
SM_004070_0140_CER	“Out of the way!”
SM_004070_0150_NAR	Thankfully, the white wolf \nheld the nearby faeries at bay.
SM_004070_0160_CER	“Thanks!”
SM_004080_0000_CER	“Cheshire!”
SM_004080_0010_NAR	The sudden appearance of two intruders\nhad the faerie fortress in a frenzy.
SM_004080_0020_NAR	Cereza seized the opportunity \nand freed Cheshire from his shackles.
SM_004080_0025_NAR	It was splendid teamwork.
SM_004080_0030_CER	“Glad to see you're up for a fight.\nThese naughty faeries are about \nto get punished!”
SM_004080_0040_NAR	[FONT:9 ]Not bad. Better than your crying.\nPunishment, is it? With pleasure![FONT:N ]\n\nBoth Cereza and Cheshire were on fire.
BK_4080_0010_CER	“Cheshire!”
BK_4080_0020_NAR	A large gash was cut on Cheshire's leg.\nBits of cotton were falling out,\nalong with his magical energy.
BK_4080_0030_NAR	The faeries had not been kind \nto their captive. Cheshire could \nhide his pain no longer. 
BK_4080_0040_CER	“That cut!”
BK_4080_0050_NAR	Unless the wound was mended,\nthe magic-infused threads that bound\nCheshire to this world would not last long.
BK_4080_0060_CER	“Hold still. If you move around like\nthat you'll just make things worse.”
BK_4080_0080_NAR	Cereza needed to suture the wound \nas soon as possible.
BK_4080_0090_NAR	There was only one way\nshe could think to do it.
BK_4080_0100_MOR	“Remember Cereza...
BK_4080_0110_MOR	As blood flows through veins,\nmagic flows through a witch's hair.
BK_4080_0120_MOR	Care for it as you would your \nmost precious tool, and defend it \nas you would your very heart.”
BK_4080_0130_CER	“Sorry Morgana, but I've found \nsomething more important.”
BK_4080_0140_NAR	These were the precious locks Cereza\nwas growing out to resemble her mother.
BK_4080_0150_NAR	As expected, they worked their magic.\nCheshire's wound closed in an instant.
BK_4080_0160_NAR	[FONT:9 ]Don't blame me if that teacher of yours has a fit,[FONT:N ]\nCheshire said quietly.
BK_4080_0170_CER	“Don't worry, it'll grow back.”\n
BK_4080_0180_CER	“Besides, if it wasn't for me,\nyou wouldn't be in this mess\nin the first place.
BK_4080_0190_CER	I promised to send you back.\nUmbra Witch's honour.”
BK_4080_0200_CER	“W-what I'm trying to say is...”
BK_4080_0210_NAR	But before she could finish\nCheshire had already returned to\nhis miniature form.
BK_4080_0220_NAR	[FONT:9 ]Well, get a move on, will you?[FONT:N ]\nhe added with a squeak.
BK_4080_0230_CER	“Yes, your majesty.”
BK_4080_0240_NAR	Cereza gave Cheshire a tight embrace.\n\nSomehow, she felt that Cheshire \nwas doing the same.
IN_4010_0010_NAR	Cereza and Cheshire, reunited!\nOnce again, the white wolf was\nnowhere to be found.\nThe intrepid pair resumed their journey.
BK_4020_0000_NAR	Something made them stop.\nA strange presence...\nThey were not alone.
BK_4020_0010_POO	“Stop! With each impetuous step you sow\nthe seeds of ruin in our kingdom.\nWe will not allow you to wake \nthe cursed child from his slumber.”
BK_4020_0020_NAR	It was the regal faerie from earlier.\n
BK_4020_0030_CER	“Hey,\nthat faerie is speaking our language!\n...I think.”
BK_4020_0040_POO	“Fie, her insolence knows no bounds!\nRepent! For a king's anger once \nstoked is not easily quenched.”
BK_4020_0050_NAR	The regal faerie continued \nhis haughty monologue.\nStill, his thick accent\nwas nigh unintelligible.\n
BK_4020_0070_CER	“This is hopeless, it must be\nsome kind of faerie dialect.\nSo, what, are you saying you're\nthe faerie king or something?”
BK_4020_0075_CER	“So, what, are you saying\nyou're the faerie king or something?”
BK_4020_0080_POO	“Insolence! \nBefore us all bend the knee. \nThose with four legs bend two.”
BK_4020_0090_POO	“The very trees of Avalon\nbow before us to pay obeisance.”\n
BK_4020_0100_POO	“We are Púca the wise, \nPúca the magnanimous.”\n
BK_4020_0110_POO	“...Pause for dramatic effect.”
BK_4020_0120_POO	“Púca,\nthe one true king of Avalon Forest!”
BK_4020_0140_CER	“Wha...okay...so it was you who did\nall that awful stuff to Cheshire!\nI see a royal behind \nin need of a good spanking!”\n
BK_4020_0150_NAR	Cheshire looked happy to oblige.\n
BK_4020_0160_POO	“Human and demon dare\nchallenge Púca, whose name strikes\nfear across all three realms?”
BK_4020_0170_POO	“We shall call down\na blast from heaven\nand make them rue their folly!”
BK_4060_0000_POO	“O woe are we!\nOur heavenly minion vanquished...\nThe flames of defeat draw near.”
BK_4060_0010_POO	“But even should the pyre consume our very self,\nthese interlopers shall go no further!”
BK_4060_0020_CER	“What's he saying now...\nI have a bad feeling about this.”
BK_4060_0030_NAR	The two sensed danger in the faerie \nnamed Púca's words, and began to run.
BK_4060_0040_POO	“Long live the faerie kingdom!”\n
BK_4060_0045_POO	“...longlivepúca.”
BK_4060_0070_NAR	With a blast, the two were sent sky high.\nHere's hoping that they'll be all right...
SM_004140_0010_CER	“Ugh...\nWhat was with that guy...”
SM_004140_0020_CER	“...Hmm?\nWhat are you on about?”
SM_004140_0030_CER	“What the!? \nOh, give me a break!!”
SM_004140_0040_NAR	Realising what had happened,\nCereza hurriedly began wiping her face clean.\n\nThe spectacle was too much for Cheshire.\nHe rolled with laughter.\n
SM_004140_0050_CER	“Now it's personal.\nThat creepy faerie best hope \nwe never cross paths again.\n\nOkay chucklepuss, joke's over.\n\nAll right, let's get a move on!”
SM_004140_0060_NAR	Cereza frowned and stormed off.\n\nTrying unsuccessfully to control his laughter,\nCheshire followed after.\n\nBut each glance at Cereza sent him back \ninto fits of seam-bursting chortles.
SM_004090_0000_LUC	“Is there no challenge you\ncannot overcome?\nCereza, you amaze me.”
SM_004090_0010_CER	“I'm not alone.\nI would have never made it this\nfar without Cheshire's help.”
SM_004090_0020_LUC	“Yes, your control of that demon is\na testament to your skill as a witch.”
SM_004090_0030_LUC	“Soon, we will meet at last.\nCereza, I count down the hours...”
BK_8120_0000_CER	“And that's number four.\nWe destroyed all the Elemental Cores!”
BK_8120_0010_CER	“You know what that means:\nhere's the last elemental power.\nLet's give it a try!”
SM_004100_0000_CER	“That howl...\nYou made it out of the fortress!”
SM_004100_0010_NAR	Cereza let out a sigh of relief.\nThe wolf seemed as energetic as ever.
SM_004100_0020_CER	“You're going to take us to Lukaon?\nWe must be getting close...\nCome on Cheshire, hurry!”
SM_004110_0000_NAR	Morgana's ghostly form appeared.\n\nShe took one look at Cereza\nand furrowed her brow.
SM_004110_0010_MOR	“Cereza, what have you done \nwith your hair?!”\n
SM_004110_0020_CER	“S-sorry...I just,\nI needed it for something.”
SM_004110_0030_NAR	Cereza explained how she had\nused her hair to save Cheshire.\n
SM_004110_0040_MOR	“For the sake of a demon?\nCereza, never forget who is the \nmaster, and who the subject.”\n
SM_004110_0050_MOR	“Under normal circumstances\nnow would come a stern lecture,\nbut that will have to wait for your\nsafe return.”
SM_004110_0070_MOR	“My spell is almost complete.\nI will have you out of that forest soon.\nJust hold on a bit longer.”
SM_004110_0080_CER	“Oh...t-thanks Morgana.”\n
SM_004110_0090_MOR	“The faeries are a formidable foe.\nBut use all I taught you and defeat them.\n\n\nMay the moon light your path...\nStay safe, Cereza.
SM_004110_0100_CER	“Oh, I'll defeat them all right.\nAnd after that I'll meet Lukaon,\nget that power, and send you back...”\n
SM_004110_0110_NAR	Cereza and Cheshire exchanged a glance.\nGetting the power from Lukaon\nwould mean the end to their journey.\nIt would mean saying farewell.
SM_004110_0120_CER	“Come on, we're almost there!”
LV_004005_0000_CER	Hm? Cheshire, you say something?
LV_004005_0010_CER	I swear I heard something...
LV_004010_0000_CER	Mummy? Is that you?
LV_004010_0010_CER	Mummy, wait! Mummy, please!!
LV_004015_0000_CER	I can get through this forest \nfine by myself.\nI'm not s-scared!
LV_004015_0010_CER	Where did that wolf go...\nMust be this way.
LV_004020_0000_NAR	Just visible through the twilight haze\nstood a large structure that\npierced the sky like a castle spire.
LV_004020_0010_CER	Cereza, you can do this \non your own...You don't need \nanyone's help...
LV_004025_0000_CER	There could be faeries anywhere.\nI've got to keep quiet.
LV_004025_0010_CER	If those faeries spot me I'll be in trouble.\nBetter move softly.
LV_004030_0000_NAR	Cereza stood against the faeries alone.\nJust how did she plan on beating them?
LV_004030_0010_CER	There's got to be something \naround here I can use..
LV_004035_0000_CER	I'm so close...\nI can't give up now!
LV_004040_0000_NAR	A colossal iron structure stood before her eyes.\nIt was a fort, built by the faeries.
LV_004040_0010_NAR	Along its walls\ncracks in the metal formed hideous gaping mouths.
LV_004040_0020_CER	What...is that?\nI've seen plenty of rifts in the forest,\nbut that thing is on a whole new level.
LV_004045_0000_CER	Where are you going? \nYou know another entrance?
LV_004050_0000_CER	Oh, Cheshire, just what have you \ngotten yourself into this time...
LV_004055_0000_CER	This tower just keeps going...\nCheshire...where are they taking you?
LV_004055_0010_CER	Even my witch training \nwasn't this tiring.
LV_004060_0000_NAR	Within, the faeries seemed to be \narguing about something loudly.
LV_004060_0010_CER	I don't understand what they're saying \nbut if I know these faeries it must \nbe something absolutely nefarious.
LV_004065_0000_CER	Look at all those faeries!\nHow am I going to make it out of here?
LV_004070_0000_CER	This reminds me of climbing \nthe clocktower with Jeanne...
LV_004070_0010_CER	She acted so tough...\nBut I knew she was scared.
LV_004075_0000_CER	Cheshire!
LV_004080_0000_CER	Restoration magic...\nI've never been able to pull that off before.
LV_004080_0010_CER	I wonder if it might work \non something else...?
LV_004085_0000_CER	How do you like that?\nDon't think I'm so shabby now, huh?
LV_004085_0010_NAR	[FONT:10 ]A cut like this is nothing.\nBut...this ribbon isn't so bad.[FONT:N ]
LV_004085_0015_NAR	Cheshire said, in a slightly embarrassed voice.
LV_004085_0020_CER	Yeah, I think it suits you perfectly.
LV_004090_0000_NAR	The sphere burned with a bright red light.\nThe two had arrived at the final Elemental Core.
CE_004000_0000_CER	Mummy? It can't be...
CE_004010_0000_CER	That torture device...\nIf I use my magic to fix it...
CE_004010_0010_CER	If it's broke, fix it!

LV_004900_0000_CER	Nothing to worry about...\nA leaf this big will hold us up no problem...\nRight?
LV_004905_0000_CER	Cheshire, you can swim?!\nI-I'll pass. I don't want to get my hair wet.
LV_004910_0000_CER	Ch-Cheshire! Not so fast!
LV_004915_0000_NAR	Cheshire was having a grand time\nsteering the lily pad every which way.
LV_004920_0000_CER	“Cheshire! Slow down!!”
LV_004925_0000_CER	“I'm soaked.\nI told you to go slow!”
LV_004930_0000_CER	Ah!\nIf I'm not careful I'll be burnt to a crisp!
LV_004935_0000_NAR	Cereza was on her own this time.\nHow was she going to get out of this pickle? 
LV_004940_0000_NAR	An odd structure appeared out of \nthe gloom, towering before Cereza.
LV_004945_0000_CER	Oops, I don't think it's supposed to turn that way...\nOh well, it works for me.
CE_004800_0000_CER	This guy's full of surprises.\n...Umm, we'd better run!
CE_004805_0000_CER	We made it...\nall right back to business.
CE_004810_0000_CER	They just keep coming!\nWe have to take down that faerie!
CE_004815_0000_CER	Now!
CE_004815_0010_CER	Let's get him!
LV_004950_0000_CER	Mummy...Please, don't go!
Pooka_vo_disappear_01	That was but luck, and nothing other!\nLuck, you hear?! Listen!
Pooka_vo_disappear_07	You are but an infantile witch, \nhow dare you make Púca suffer so?!
Text/Episode5
BK_5000_0000_POO	“Halt!”
BK_5000_0010_NAR	Before them stood Púca, \nthe ostentatious faerie from earlier.\nHe appeared slightly charred\nfrom the explosion.
BK_5000_0020_CER	“Well if it isn't the self-proclaimed king.\nWhat is it this time?”
BK_5000_0030_POO	“We have no words for you, girl.\nYour Infernal compatriot, however,\nstill owes us an answer to our...\nProposition.”
BK_5000_0040_POO	“Too long has a demon suffered \nunder the oppressive yoke \nof that wee witch.\n\nLeave her! And by our own hand\na portal to Inferno we shall rend!”
BK_5000_0060_NAR	The faerie Púca was trying \nto tempt Cheshire, offering\nto send him back to Inferno.\nDid he truly have the power to open\na portal right here, right now?
BK_5000_0070_POO	“Well, demon? \nYou scorned our generous offer \nonce before. But how will your \ntune change when the fires of \nInferno tickle your mane?”
BK_5000_0090_NAR	With a flamboyant flourish, the \nfaerie opened a massive fiery gate.\nCereza could feel the heat \nfrom beyond. The familiar sounds \nof the forest were joined by \nthe faint cries of the damned.
BK_5000_0100_CER	“Cheshire?”
BK_5000_0110_NAR	Cheshire slowly approached the gate.
BK_5000_0120_NAR	As he neared the threshold,\nmemories of their journey\ncame flooding back to Cereza.
BK_5000_0170_POO	“You wool-stuffed scullion!\nYou witch-whipped kitten!”
BK_5000_0180_NAR	Once again, Cheshire had\nrejected Púca's offer.
BK_5000_0190_POO	“So be it!\nBut Inferno's fires must be fed.\nIf you will not return, \nthen send that vile girl in your stead!”
BK_5000_0220_CER	“What have you done to him?!”
BK_5000_0230_NAR	Cereza's question fell on deaf ears.\nPúca was busy cackling maniacally.
BK_5000_0240_NAR	             Until...
BK_5000_0250_CER	“Cheshire?...What's wrong?”
BK_5000_0260_NAR	Cheshire, blind with rage, turned his gaze on Cereza.\nThe demon bared its fangs...and pounced!
BK_5010_0000_NAR	Cheshire had returned to his senses,\nbut his violent tantrum had\ntaken a heavy toll.
BK_5010_0010_CER	“Cheshire...\nWhy didn't you go into the portal?”
BK_5010_0020_NAR	[FONT:9 ]That weirdo? Couldn't trust him. [FONT:N ]\nCheshire replied, \nbefore turning away. 
BK_5010_0030_CER	“So does that mean...\nYou trust me?”
BK_5010_0040_NAR	Cheshire said nothing.\nHe closed his tired eyes.
BK_5010_0060_NAR	Cereza sung him a lullaby\nshe remembered from long ago.
IN_5000_0000_CER	“Again?! Wait, something's different...”
IN_5000_0010_CER	“You got it Cheshire,\nlet's show him what we can do!”
IN_5000_0020_CER	“An a-angel!?\nWhat is one of those doing here?”
IN_5000_0030_CER	“You got it Cheshire,\nlet's show him what we can do!”
SM_005010_0000_NAR	They had returned to the forest.\nA new path appeared before their eyes.\n
SM_005010_0010_NAR	It seemed to call to Cereza,\nas if a strange force were pulling her.
SM_005010_0020_CER	“This feeling...Lukaon is up ahead,\nI'm sure of it.”
SM_005010_0030_NAR	Somehow Cereza knew that if she\nstepped beyond this point there \nwould be no turning back.
SM_005010_0040_CER	“We're getting close Cheshire.\nWhen you're ready,\nlet's go finish this.”\n
IN_5010_0000_NAR	Beyond this point \nthere is no turning back.
IN_5010_0010_CER	“Are you ready Cheshire?\nI'm not sure...”
LV_005005_0000_NAR	With all the Elemental Cores destroyed,\nthe barrier put up by the faeries disappeared.
LV_005005_0010_CER	I see...that must be the entrance...
LV_005005_0020_CER	The heart of the forest...\nWhere Lukaon is waiting.
LV_005010_0000_CER	I'm not scared.\nCheshire, are you ready?
LV_005010_0010_NAR	[FONT:10 ]Just leap in claws first.\nDon't give yourself a chance to be afraid.[FONT:N ]
LV_005010_0020_NAR	Cheshire's steady voice filled Cereza with courage.
LV_005015_0000_NAR	A cold, bitter wind continued to blow mercilessly.\nBut their hearts - were not cold at all.
LV_005015_0010_NAR	Together, they could overcome any obstacle.\nThat belief caused their hearts to shine brighter than the sun.
LV_005020_0000_CER	Cheshire, let's fight our way through!

CE_005000_0000_CER	Cheshire!\nLukaon, stop! Give him back!

CE_005030_0000_CER	If I get hit by that blast I'm finished...

SM_005020_0000_FAS	“You've finally done it, miss.”
SM_005020_0010_NAR	A voice echoed through the trees.\nIt was one of the rare sounds in this \nforest that put Cereza's heart at ease.
SM_005020_0020_CER	“Ignis!”
SM_005020_0030_FAS	“Congratulations on destroying all four cores.\nYou've put those faeries in a right kerfuffle!”

SM_005020_0120_FAS	“I've lived in Avalon forest for ages now.\nIt used to be such a beautiful, lovely place.”
SM_005020_0130_FAS	“...The faeries changed that.”
SM_005020_0140_FAS	“They corrupted this forest \nand terrorised its inhabitants.\nI've seen them do such horrible things,\npowerless to do anything but watch.”

Text/Episode6
SM_006010_0000_NAR	They had finally made it.\nAs promised, Lukaon, the boy from\nCereza's dreams, was waiting.\nBut unlike his radiant ethereal\ncounterpart, this Lukaon looked \npale and lifeless.
SM_006010_0010_CER	“L-Lukaon?”
SM_006010_0020_NAR	As Cereza called out his name,\nshe heard Lukaon's voice, \never so faint.
SM_006010_0030_LUC	“Welcome Cereza,\nI knew you would make it.”
SM_006010_0040_CER	“Hold on, Lukaon,\nI'll get you out of there!”
SM_006010_0050_LUC	“No, I am here.\nI'm afraid what you see in that \ncrystal is nothing but a shell...”
SM_006010_0060_NAR	Both Cereza and Cheshire were startled.\nThe source of Lukaon's voice\nwas none other than the white wolf.
SM_006010_0070_CER	“Wh-why does the white wolf \nsound like Lukaon...?”\n
SM_006010_0080_LUC	“Don't be afraid...\nWhile my body was sealed,\nmy soul still runs free\nin the body of this wolf.”
SM_006010_0090_NAR	And it was in that body that\nLukaon had guided them\nthrough the forest.
SM_006010_0100_CER	“You were sealed? But why?”
SM_006010_0110_LUC	“My blood. \nI am the child of human and faerie.”\n
SM_006010_0120_CER	“Human...and faerie?”
SM_006010_0130_LUC	“Fear not.\n\nNot all faeries are like \nthose you've met. I wish to \nlive in harmony with humans.\n\nFor that, I was cursed to this fate.”
SM_006010_0140_NAR	And so, the boy told Cereza\nof his tragic past.
SM_006010_0150_NAR	Lukaon was the last faerie prince,\nthe son of the former king\nand his human queen.
SM_006010_0160_NAR	The king was loved by his subjects,\nand even sought a way to live\nin harmony with the human world.\n
SM_006010_0170_NAR	But a faction of evil faeries \nconspired against him.\nKilling the king in cold blood,\nthey next came for his wife\nand young Lukaon.
SM_006010_0180_NAR	His mother managed to save\nLukaon's spirit, before she was\ndriven out of the faerie kingdom,\nnever to return again.
SM_006010_0190_NAR	Unable to kill Lukaon,\nbut fearing the return of\nhis royal bloodline,\nthe rebellious faeries sealed\nhis body using a powerful spell.
SM_006010_0200_CER	“Both your parents...Lukaon, \nyou've been through so much.”
SM_006010_0210_NAR	Lukaon's past reminded \nCereza of her own.\nHer heart hurt for him.
SM_006010_0220_LUC	“All I could do was wander the forest,\ntrying desperately to hold on to\nthe memory of my human self.\n\nBut Cereza, there exists one \nway to break this curse.”
SM_006010_0230_LUC	“It requires a special power,\nsomething only a witch can possess.\n\nAnd so, each time a witch entered \nthe forest my hopes soared!\nI tried my best to guide them here but...”
SM_006010_0240_LUC	“Oh Cereza, \nI'm so happy you made it here safely.\nNow, I beg you, please help me \nwake from this nightmare.”\n\n
SM_006010_0250_LUC	“With the seal broken\nand my faerie power restored,\nwe can leave this forest together!\nI will help you save your mother,\nso please...”
SM_006010_0260_CER	“Something only a witch can possess?\nJust say the word; \nhow can I help?”
SM_006010_0270_LUC	“Why Cereza, you've already \nbrought me exactly what I need!”
SM_006010_0280_CER	“W-what?\nI...did?”
SM_006010_0290_LUC	“Yes! You brought the sacrifice!”\n
SM_006010_0300_LUC	“That demon is perfect.\nJust what we need to break the curse!”
SM_006010_0310_CER	“What?”
SM_006010_0320_NAR	Cereza could not believe her ears.\nSacrifice Cheshire?
SM_006010_0330_LUC	“Hurry, I must absorb that demon's power.\nAt long last...the curse will be broken!”
SM_006010_0340_CER	“Wha - I - I can't do that!”
SM_006010_0350_LUC	“...What? What do you mean, why not?”
SM_006010_0360_CER	“Sacrifice Cheshire? \nI can't do that, he's my friend!”\n
SM_006010_0370_LUC	“Your friend? You mean that demon?\nCereza, what are you saying?”
SM_006010_0380_LUC	“Look at it! Demons are Infernal \ncreatures that feast on human souls!\n\n\nYou witches harness their power\nas a tool, a weapon, nothing more!”
SM_006010_0390_CER	“You're wrong. Cheshire is no tool. \nHe's a living creature, \nwith his own thoughts and dreams.\nWe made it this far by working together,\nso I'm not about to offer him\nup like some sacrificial goat!”
SM_006010_0400_CER	“I want to help you but\nI simply cannot do that.”
SM_006010_0410_LUC	“I don't believe this...”
SM_006010_0420_LUC	“I'm sorry Cereza,\nbut you leave me no choice.”
SM_006010_0430_CER	“Lukaon...”
BK_6000_0000_NAR	Cereza saw Lukaon's face,\nonly a moment ago so full of hope,\nnow contorted by sorrow.\nShe wanted desperately to help him.
BK_6000_0010_CER	“There must be something else.\nI'll help you find another way!”
BK_6000_0020_LUC	“You don't understand...\nThis is my last chance!”
BK_6000_0030_CER	“Lukaon, what are you doing?”
BK_6000_0040_CER	“You really mean to sacrifice Cheshire?\nStop, I'm begging you!”
BK_6000_0050_NAR	Hearing desperation in Cereza's voice,\nfor an instant Lukaon hesitated...\nBut his mind was made up.
BK_6000_0060_CER	“Cheshire!”
BK_6000_0070_NAR	Captured by the faerie prince,\nCheshire's life force \nwas being drained.
BK_6000_0080_CER	“I can't believe I trusted you!”
BK_6000_0090_NAR	Cereza knew what she had to do.
BK_6000_0100_CER	“I thought we could be friends!”\n
BK_6010_0000_NAR	Having lost Cheshire's power,\nLukaon struggled to stay on his feet.\nAnd then...
BK_6010_0010_CER	“Lukaon!”
BK_6010_0020_NAR	A heroic demon?\nSuch altruism was unheard of\nthroughout all Infernal texts...\nBut Cereza understood.
BK_6010_0030_LUC	“You two...”
SM_006020_0000_NAR	The sorrow and anger were gone \nfrom Lukaon's eyes.
SM_006020_0010_LUC	“My soul cannot hold this form\nmuch longer...I figured this\ntime was my last chance.”
SM_006020_0020_CER	“No...”
SM_006020_0030_LUC	“I thought demons were all\nheartless monsters...\nBut I was wrong.”
SM_006020_0040_LUC	“Cheshire, was it?\nForgive me for what I tried to do.\nThe only heartless one...was me.”
SM_006020_0050_CER	“Lukaon...”
PH_6010_0000_NAR	All of a sudden, there was an ear-splitting crack,\nand a flash of light illuminated the sky.
PH_6010_0010_NAR	Morgana had succeeded in breaking\nthe barrier trapping them in the forest.
SM_006030_0000_CER	“Of course! \nIf we can get you to my master\nshe'll find a way to save you!”
SM_006030_0010_LUC	“What?”
SM_006030_0020_CER	“There's still time.\nCome on, we have to get you to her.\n\nLukaon, I won't let you die here!”
SM_006030_0030_POO	“Splendid! \nOh, the pathos is palpable!”
SM_006030_0040_CER	“You!”
SM_006030_0050_POO	“On behalf of Avalon Forest,\nyou have our eternal gratitude,\nwhy, the trees themselves shall\nsing a ballad of your deeds.”
SM_006030_0060_NAR	It was Púca, the self-proclaimed king.\nHis usual retinue was nowhere to be seen.\n\nThough his outfit had seen better days,\nhis elocution was still to be admired.
SM_006030_0070_CER	“We're in no mood for your riddles, \nback off!”\n
SM_006030_0080_POO	“Why, we have no need to quarrel.\nOur subjects will gladly escort you\nto the edge of the forest.”
SM_006030_0090_POO	“And led by our faerie light,\none ill needs that lupine guide.\nLeave the filthy beast where he lies.”
SM_006030_0100_NAR	Púca was after Lukaon's spirit,\nand the royal power that it contained.
SM_006030_0110_NAR	Hearing his words, Cereza knew:\nit had been Púca who had\nbetrayed the faerie king.\nPúca who had torn Lukaon's family apart\nbefore cursing him to wander\nthe forest in solitude.
SM_006030_0120_LUC	“You fiend!\nEnough...I will run no longer.\nBut in exchange, let those two go.”
SM_006030_0130_CER	“No, Lukaon, you can't!”
SM_006030_0140_LUC	“This is for the best, Cereza.\nMy time is up...”
SM_006030_0150_CER	“Lukaon, don't give up!”
SM_006030_0160_CER	“We're not going to let\nyou take him, got it?!\n\nAnd for the record,\nI knew you were lying about being a king!”
SM_006030_0170_POO	“So be it.\nOne way or another he will die.\nAnd with his royal line extinguished\nwe shall be eclipsed no longer!”
SM_006030_0180_POO	“Faerie brethren:\nthe cursed child is finally within our grasp.\nThe false king's sun reaches its nadir,\nand now Púca's star shines bright!”
BK_6040_0000_NAR	On Púca's signal, a terrifying number \nof faeries appeared out of the darkness. 
BK_6040_0010_NAR	Staring down what must have been \nevery last faerie in Avalon,\nCereza's legs began to tremble.\nBut no matter the odds, \nshe refused to give up.
BK_6040_0020_NAR	But then-
BK_6040_0030_CER	“Cheshire?”
BK_6040_0040_NAR	The writhing mass of faeries \nhot on his heels, Cheshire \nran towards the pillar of light.
BK_6020_0000_NAR	Escaping the faeries' clutches,\nthe pair made it out of the forest.
BK_6020_0005_NAR	Or so they thought...
BK_6020_0020_CER	“Cheshire!”
BK_6020_0040_NAR	Caught by the faeries,\nthey were slowly being \ndragged back into the forest.
BK_6020_0050_NAR	Refusing to give in,\nCereza held on with all her might.\nBut then...
BK_6020_0090_NAR	Something sent the faeries flying\nlike leaves scattered to the wind.
BK_6020_0100_NAR	This was a technique Cereza \nhad seen before.
BK_6020_0110_CER	“Morgana!”
BK_6020_0120_POO	“You loathsome witch! \nI should have known you-”
BK_6020_0130_NAR	But before Púca could finish,\nMorgana extinguished his life\nwith a single powerful strike.
BK_6020_0140_CER	“Morgana!\n\nI'm so sorry for disobeying you.\nBut please, save the \nscolding for later.”
BK_6020_0150_CER	“This wolf, \nit's actually the spirit of a boy!
BK_6020_0160_CER	If we don't do something, \nhe'll die. Please Morgana, \ncan you save him?”
BK_6020_0170_NAR	Morgana said nothing.\nShe gently stroked the wolf's fur.
BK_6020_0180_NAR	Confused, \nCereza looked at her master.
BK_6020_0200_NAR	She saw an expression of which\nshe did not think Morgana was capable.\nIt was warm...filled with love.
BK_6020_0210_CER	“Morgana?”
BK_6020_0220_MOR	“You want to save him?”
BK_6020_0230_MOR	“How dare you...\nHow dare you say those words\nafter what you did to him \nyou foolish girl!”
SM_006040_0000_MOR	“Cereza...why is that demon still here?\nDid you not reach the altar?\n\nWhat do you think those\nyears of training were for?”
SM_006040_0010_NAR	Morgana appeared to be growing\nmore angry by the second.\nShe advanced on Cereza and Cheshire.
SM_006040_0020_CER	“Morgana, what are you saying?\nWhat's wrong?”
SM_006040_0030_MOR	“You still don't get it?\nThe training, the brace...\nThe dream?”
SM_006040_0040_MOR	“Do you have any idea how long\nI prepared for the day my \nprecious Lukaon would return!”
SM_006040_0050_NAR	Thunder crashed in the distance.\nWind screamed through the trees.\nA cold chill ran through the air.
SM_006040_0060_MOR	“Dozens of girls I \nlured into that forest...\nEach required years of training. \nAll for naught!”
SM_006040_0070_MOR	“I was so close this time.\nBut you had to go and ruin \neverything, you selfish brat!”\n
SM_006040_0080_NAR	Cereza had endured her share of\nscolding from Morgana, \nbut this time was different.\nThese were not the words of \na strict teacher. They were filled\nwith nothing but pure loathing.
SM_006040_0090_CER	“Morgana, I-I...”
SM_006040_0100_MOR	“Useless girl...\n\nLukaon and I will be together again.\nYou will surrender that\nwretched demon this instant!”
SM_006040_0120_MOR	“Oh, I see. \nMade a new “friend” have you?”
SM_006040_0130_MOR	“A demon born under the\nfull moon of the bissextile night.\nThat creature is the key to\nbreaking Lukaon's curse!\nNow Cereza...I have waited far\ntoo long to let a child's\nsentiment stand in my way!”
BK_6030_0000_CER	“Morgana...\nI know I wasn't a good pupil.”
BK_6030_0010_CER	“I always messed up during training,\nand broke your rules.\nI-I know I let you down...”
BK_6030_0020_CER	“You might have been strict, but\nI always knew you cared about me.\nYou were...like a mother to me.”
BK_6030_0021_CER	“I just wanted to\nmake you proud!”
BK_6030_0030_MOR	“Get away!”
BK_6030_0050_NAR	[FONT:9 ]Pull yourself together.\nShe is our enemy![FONT:N ]\nCheshire tried to get \nCereza to her feet.
BK_6030_0060_NAR	Morgana's next attack\nwould come at any moment.\nBut Cereza could not move a muscle.
BK_6030_0070_NAR	Just then,\nsomething caused Morgana to stop.\nUsing the last of his strength,\nLukaon clung to her dress.
BK_6030_0090_LUC	“Please, mother, no more.\nI can't bear to see you like this.”\n
BK_6030_0100_MOR	“Don't fret, my dear.\nSoon everything will be back\nto the way it was.”
BK_6030_0120_LUC	“Mother...Mother!”
BK_6030_0130_NAR	Her expression fixed,\nMorgana moved her son aside.
BK_6030_0140_MOR	“A pity. You had the potential \nto become a fine witch, Cereza,\nif only you'd hardened your heart...\nBut you were always so damn soft!”
BK_6100_0000_CER	“Cheshire!”
BK_6100_0010_CER	
BK_8200_0000_NAR	[FONT:9 ]What's wrong,\ngiving up without a fight?[FONT:N ]\n\nCereza heard Cheshire's voice\nringing clearly in her mind.
BK_8200_0010_CER	“What am I supposed to do!?\nThere's no way I can fight Morgana!”
BK_8200_0020_NAR	[FONT:9 ]I see. Well then, I guess that means our journey is over, hmm?[FONT:N ]\nThe demon sounded disappointed.
BK_8200_0030_CER	“Our...journey?”\n\n
BK_8200_0040_NAR	[FONT:9 ]That's what you'd call it, right,\nthis whole thing to save your mum?\nYou blabbered so much about her,\neven I was starting to look\nforward to meeting her...[FONT:N ]\nCheshire paused.
BK_8200_0050_CER	“What is it?”\n
BK_8200_0060_NAR	[FONT:9 ]I'm sorry for what I did\nback there in the forest.[FONT:N ]
BK_8200_0070_CER	“Cheshire...”
BK_8200_0080_NAR	[FONT:9 ]And you were right. I never would \nhave made it this far on my own.\nThank you.[FONT:N ]
BK_8200_0085_NAR	Cereza was moved by the\ndemon's unexpected words.
BK_8200_0090_CER	“Cheshire wait!\nI promised to send you home.\nI intend to keep that promise!”
IN_6000_0100_MOR	That speed...I-impossible!\n
BK_8210_0000_NAR	Friends protect each other.
BK_8210_0010_NAR	Friends keep their promises.
BK_8210_0020_NAR	Gone was the fear and hesitation\nfrom Cereza's eyes. In its place\nwas courage and steadfast resolve.

HUD_GAMEOVER_TXT_0001	Cereza perished among the trees\nof Avalon Forest, eventually fading\nfrom the memories of all who knew her.
HUD_GAMEOVER_TXT_0002	Cereza met her end deep within the\nforest, her crystal coffin gradually\nswallowed by the forest undergrowth.
HUD_GAMEOVER_TXT_0003	Captured by the faeries, Cereza was\nsealed away at the top of Faerieland\nTower, her crystal coffin slowly\nworn down by the wind and rain.
HUD_GAMEOVER_TXT_0004	Cereza sank to the black depths\nof the lake; only its bottom dwellers \nknowing what became of her.
HUD_GAMEOVER_TXT_0005	Púca's Fortress brought Cereza\nto her knees. Her crystal coffin was\ndiscarded in a forgotten corner.
HUD_GAMEOVER_TXT_0006	Cereza's luck had run out. \nShe was doomed to spend \neternity inside a faerie cage \nof illusions.
HUD_GAMEOVER_TXT_0007	Cereza's dreams came to an end\nat the hands of the faeries.\nThe white wolf's remains lay near her, \nas if wanting to be at her side.
HUD_GAMEOVER_TXT_0008	The wisps still cry out for help, but\nwith Cereza fallen, there is no one\nleft to extend a hand.
HUD_GAMEOVER_TXT_0009	Caught by the faeries, \nCereza's spirit was tossed into \na lantern, where it burned\nbrighter than any ever since.
HUD_GAMEOVER_TXT_0010	The faeries' malicious laughter filled the area\nas Cereza and Cheshire were ejected from\nthe Tír na nÓg by a mysterious force.
HUD_GAMEOVER_TXT_1001	The faeries roared in applause\nfor the new attraction they\nhad procured.\n"Only real magic here, friends..."
HUD_GAMEOVER_TXT_1002	The Jabberwock swallowed Cereza\nwhole, but was far from sated.\nHe took to the skies to search\nfor his next morsel.
HUD_GAMEOVER_TXT_1003	The magnanimous Púca had\ndefeated all who dared oppose him.\nThe world was now his for the taking.
HUD_GAMEOVER_TXT_1004	*Chomp* *crunch, crunch* *gulp*...\nA few moments later, a pitiful cry\nechoed through the otherwise silent forest.
HUD_GAMEOVER_TXT_1005	Finally regaining both his body and\nhis original strength, Lukaon settled as\nthe true king of Avalon...after taking \na moment of silence for the sacrifices \nmade along the way.
HUD_GAMEOVER_TXT_1006	Morgana and Lukaon - the two had\nconquered all obstacles and could now\nbe together, living happily ever after.
HUD_GAMEOVER_TXT_2001	Her strength having left her,\nJeanne's soul faded away.\nSoon all that remained in the\nforest were two lifeless toys.
HUD_INTERACT_TEXT_0000_CER	It's Morgana's house.\n...If I go back now, she'll be mad.
HUD_INTERACT_TEXT_0001_CER	This gate leads to town.\n...Not that I particularly want to go.
HUD_INTERACT_TEXT_0002_CER	This rock looks just like a fang...\nWhat if there was a giant monster,\njust underneath the ground here...
HUD_INTERACT_TEXT_0003_CER	These heavy lamps are so hard to clean.\nOh my, they've gotten dirty again...
HUD_INTERACT_TEXT_0004_CER	I wonder if Morgana chose these lamps.\nFunny, I think we may have similar taste!
HUD_INTERACT_TEXT_0006_CER	This jug is positively ancient.\nA new, lighter one would be nice.
HUD_INTERACT_TEXT_0007_CER	What's my textbook doing here?!\nI'd better put it away later.
HUD_INTERACT_TEXT_0008_CER	Wow, such a lovely view!\nI could just stay here forever...\nbut no time for that!
HUD_INTERACT_TEXT_0009_CER	Oh, what a cute little fishy!\nI hope you grow up big and strong!
HUD_INTERACT_TEXT_0010_CER	I'll be back soon, I promise.
HUD_INTERACT_TEXT_0011_CER	I'm not going to town.\nI'm going to Avalon Forest!
HUD_INTERACT_TEXT_0012_CER	Maybe I can say a little wish to this candle.\nPlease...may Avalon make my dreams come true!
HUD_INTERACT_TEXT_0013_CER	I'd better be sure to refill the lamp oil\nonce I'm back from the forest.
HUD_INTERACT_TEXT_0014_CER	Ugh, there are so many bugs!\nJust...stay away from me!
HUD_INTERACT_TEXT_0016_CER	I filled it up when Morgana wasn't looking!\nShe surely won't run out now!
HUD_INTERACT_TEXT_0017_CER	I can become a powerful witch if I go to the forest.\nI won't need to study any more!
HUD_INTERACT_TEXT_0018_CER	I won't be able to enjoy this view any more...\nbut I've got to be strong for Mummy!
HUD_INTERACT_TEXT_0019_CER	Do you think the fish sleep at this hour?
HUD_INTERACT_TEXT_0020_CER	I hope Morgana will take good care\nof the violets I gave her...
HUD_INTERACT_TEXT_0021_CER	This is so high up!\nJust imagine if I fell...ohh...
HUD_INTERACT_TEXT_0029_CER	What a big spider's nest!\nIt seems like the owner isn't home...
HUD_INTERACT_TEXT_0030_CER	I can't be going to the house now! \nIt's time for training! I've been waiting for this!
HUD_INTERACT_TEXT_0031_CER	It's much too late to be heading into town now!
HUD_INTERACT_TEXT_0033_CER	Forgot to clean this...but Morgana \nshouldn't notice when it's this dark.
HUD_INTERACT_TEXT_0034_CER	I could watch the flames of these \nflicker at night forever...
HUD_INTERACT_TEXT_0035_CER	Fetch a bucket of water and carry it \nto Morgana...is this really witch training?
HUD_INTERACT_TEXT_0036_CER	Hmm...it's too dark to read now.
HUD_INTERACT_TEXT_0037_CER	Morgana's house seems scarier at night...
HUD_INTERACT_TEXT_0038_CER	It's so dark, I'll be in trouble if I stumble!\nI'd better stay away from the pond...
HUD_INTERACT_TEXT_0039_CER	No more Mandragora...right? \nGot to keep an eye out, \nthey grow back so quickly...
HUD_INTERACT_TEXT_0101_CER	Mmm, the air tastes fantastic!\nI should be able to relax here.
HUD_INTERACT_TEXT_0104_CER	Wh-what is that?!\nDid the faeries do that as well?!
HUD_INTERACT_TEXT_0105_CER	Whoa!\nThe grass is all wet and slippery!
HUD_INTERACT_TEXT_0106_CER	What a huge lake!\nHm? Is something...stuck?
HUD_INTERACT_TEXT_0107_CER	What is this thing?! Well, looks \nlike there's no turning back now...
HUD_INTERACT_TEXT_0108_CER	I guess this forest won't let me out \nthat easily...
HUD_INTERACT_TEXT_0201_CER	These boards are rotten!\nOh, I hope they don't collapse...
HUD_INTERACT_TEXT_0203_CER	Hm? Something's carved here...\n“Capture all humans who enter the forest!”
HUD_INTERACT_TEXT_0208_CER	This one's quite old.\nIt seems like it's been here for a long time.
HUD_INTERACT_TEXT_0209_CER	Poor old swing. If only this forest had\nsomeone who could fix you...
HUD_INTERACT_TEXT_0211_CER	Is this...a grave?\nI wonder whose it is...
HUD_INTERACT_TEXT_0212_CER	Is this supposed to be me and Cheshire?\nCome on, I'm way cuter than this!
HUD_INTERACT_TEXT_0214_CER	Our wanted posters are just scattered everywhere!\nWhat an incredibly rude bunch!
HUD_INTERACT_TEXT_0216_CER	Ahh...hah...\nWhat cargo is it carrying in such a hurry?
HUD_INTERACT_TEXT_0217_CER	“Presenting the rare talent, Amadán Dubh!\nBehold his miracles at Amadán's Big Top!”...?
HUD_INTERACT_TEXT_0218_CER	“Humans are welcome at our circus!”\nWhy is it written in human language...?
HUD_INTERACT_TEXT_0219_CER	That was quite the lengthy slide...\nJust thinking about it makes my bottom hurt.
HUD_INTERACT_TEXT_0220_CER	Looking closely, this cage is all battered.\nI wonder if it was tossed out as rubbish.
HUD_INTERACT_TEXT_0223_CER	They're using wisps as circus attractions?!\nHow cruel!
HUD_INTERACT_TEXT_0300_CER	The dust in here is just awful...\nIs this some sort of faerie storeroom?
HUD_INTERACT_TEXT_0301_CER	A faerie automaton...made of metal?\nDo they use this in the circus too...?
HUD_INTERACT_TEXT_0302_CER	This machine's bigger than I am!\nI wonder what it's used for...
HUD_INTERACT_TEXT_0304_CER	The way this plant waves back and forth...\nit's almost mesmerising...
HUD_INTERACT_TEXT_0307_CER	Oh no, is this a dead end...?\nI've got to do something, or else...
HUD_INTERACT_TEXT_0309_CER	Every cage is completely destroyed.\nSomeone must've had a big tantrum.
HUD_INTERACT_TEXT_0310_CER	Someone must've been spying on us\nover a nice cup of tea...
HUD_INTERACT_TEXT_0400_CER	A lake? I'm not scared in the least!\nI'm like a fish in the water.
HUD_INTERACT_TEXT_0401_CER	These lily pads are proving to be useful.\nThey can be boats, stepping stones...
HUD_INTERACT_TEXT_0402_CER	Well...This spinny-thing \nseems to be broken, too bad.
HUD_INTERACT_TEXT_0404_CER	All the trees are dried and dead...\nIt must be the faeries' work, I'm sure of it.
HUD_INTERACT_TEXT_0405_CER	Flames everywhere! Even Morgana's hardest \ntraining doesn't make me sweat this much!
HUD_INTERACT_TEXT_0406_CER	What a monstrously large building...\nIt must be very important, I'll say.
HUD_INTERACT_TEXT_0407_CER	Just watching this is making me dizzy...
HUD_INTERACT_TEXT_0500_CER	Everything is completely frozen.\nI'll be too before long...
HUD_INTERACT_TEXT_0900_CER	This gate has a see-saw on it,\njust the right size for a wisp...
HUD_INTERACT_TEXT_0901_CER	1,2,3...Looks like we'll need\nthree wisps to open this gate.
HUD_PREVENT_TEXT_0000_CER	I'd better go talk to Morgana.\nI'm already late. She's getting angrier by the second!
HUD_PREVENT_TEXT_0002_CER	I need to focus on my chores...\nor Morgana will have a thundering fit again.
HUD_PREVENT_TEXT_0003_CER	Faeries...I'd get caught in an instant if I went that way.
HUD_PREVENT_TEXT_0004_CER	This isn't the way. I need to catch the white wolf!
HUD_PREVENT_TEXT_0005_CER	I, I can handle this! Come on Cereza!
HUD_PREVENT_TEXT_0006_CER	You're chomping to see what's behind that\ndoor, aren't you. Well come on then, let's go.
HUD_PREVENT_TEXT_0007_CER	I...I can't give up now. Come on, Cereza...\nYou're doing this for Colm!
HUD_PREVENT_TEXT_0008_CER	I forgot the herb basket! Better not\ngo back to Morgana empty handed...

Text/Prologue
BK_0000_0000_NAR	Long ago, there existed two clans,\nthe Lumen Sages of light,\nand the Umbra Witches of darkness.\nTogether they controlled \na mysterious power.
BK_0000_0010_NAR	The clans put in place strict laws \nto ensure that strife would never \nconsume them. But a pair of \nstar-crossed lovers broke this rule\nand a child was born with \nthe blood of both sage and witch.
BK_0000_0020_NAR	It was a beautiful baby girl.
BK_0000_0030_NAR	As punishment for their forbidden\nlove, the pair were torn asunder;\nthe girl's sage father was exiled \nto a far land, and her mother \nlocked away in a solitary jail.
BK_0000_0040_NAR	The witch clan took in the young \ngirl, but she grew up shunned \nas a pariah, cursed by \nthe circumstance of her birth.
BK_0000_0050_NAR	Her one comfort was the nights \nshe snuck into the village jail to visit her mother's cell.
BK_0000_0060_NAR	\nHer mother passed each gruelling day barely \nable to so much as move in her cold cell. \nBut when her daughter came to visit, the witch always showed her a loving smile.
BK_0000_0070_NAR	But even this small happiness\neventually came to an end.
BK_0000_0080_NAR	On the night of the girl's tenth \nbirthday, her mother was \nto be moved to a deeper cell,\nwhere even the faintest memory\nof daylight could not reach her.
BK_0000_0090_NAR	In desperation\nthe girl tried a daring rescue.\nBut with only a child's strength, \nthe attempt was in vain.
BK_0000_0100_NAR	More alone than ever before, the young girl clung\nto all she had left: a stuffed cat named Cheshire,\nwhich her mother had made for her long ago.
BK_0000_0110_NAR	Many moons have since passed.
BK_0000_0120_NAR	Turning her back on the village,\nthe girl was taken in by an \nexiled witch, who lived on \nthe outskirts of town.
BK_0000_0130_NAR	Under her strict guidance, \nthe girl continued to train\nin the ways of the dark arts.
BK_0000_0140_NAR	She was determined to be a powerful \nwitch, and one day save her mother.
BK_0000_0150_NAR	Her name was Cereza.
SM_000010_0000_CER	I've got to hurry...
IN_0000_0000_WIA	The sullied child!
IN_0000_0010_WIB	She'll bring misfortune on us all...
IN_0000_0020_WIC	Stay away, she can't be trusted!
IN_0000_0030_WID	You don't belong here!
SM_000020_0000_CER	“Mummy...”
SM_000020_0020_JEA	“What do you think you're doing?”
SM_000020_0040_JEA	“Cereza, you're almost out of time!\nThis is your last chance...\nIf you don't hurry you may\nnever see your mother again.”
SM_000020_0050_CER	“Jeanne...I-I can't...”
SM_000020_0060_JEA	“Oh, you big baby.”
SM_000020_0070_JEA	“Come on, I'll lead the way!”
SM_000020_0080_JEA	
IN_0010_0000_JEA	Hurry up Cereza, \nwe don't have all night!
IN_0010_0010_JEA	Here, use this!
IN_0010_0030_CER	T-thanks!
IN_0010_0040_JEA	We're almost there, hurry up!
IN_0025_0000_JEA	Hurry!
IN_0025_0001_JEA	Stop dallying!
IN_0025_0002_JEA	Cereza!
IN_0025_0003_JEA	They'll find us!
IN_0025_0004_JEA	This way!
SM_000030_0000_JEA	“Oh no, they're onto us.\nLeave the guards to me.\nYou hurry on ahead!”
SM_000030_0010_CER	“Wait, Jeanne! I can't do this alone.”
BK_0010_0010_CER	“Who are you?”
BK_0010_0020_LUC	“Cereza...give you...\n...Power to save...mother...”
BK_0010_0030_CER	Power?
BK_0010_0040_LUC	“Avalon Forest...\nThe white wolf...guide you...”
BK_0010_0050_CER	“I'll go, I promise!” 
BK_0010_0060_CER	“That dream again...\nBut the ending...”
BK_0010_0070_NAR	It was a dream Cereza knew by heart.\nBut this time something had changed.\n
BK_0010_0080_NAR	Cereza decided to consult\nher friend Cheshire.
BK_0010_0090_CER	“A strange boy appeared \nand told me something incredible.\nHe said if I went to Avalon Forest\nhe'd give me a fantastic power.”
BK_0010_0100_CER	“If we had that, rescuing\nMummy would be a piece of cake.”
BK_0010_0110_CER	“The forbidden forest...”
BK_0010_0120_NAR	The oft-repeated warning from Cereza's teacher\nrung in her ears: “Avalon Forest is home to faeries, \ncreatures who love to whisk away children. Stay away!”
BK_0010_0130_MOR	“Cereza, where are you my dear?”
BK_0010_0140_NAR	Cereza's teacher Morgana was standing by the door, \nher frown discernible even from a distance.
SM_000040_0000_MOR	“Chores neglected, and I find my \napprentice enjoying her beauty sleep...”
SM_000040_0010_CER	“I'm sorry,\nI just closed my eyes for a second...”\n
SM_000040_0030_NAR	Cereza began making an excuse,\nbut Morgana's scowl stopped her\nin her tracks.
SM_000040_0040_CER	“Yes ma'am, I'll get to them right away!”
SM_000040_0050_NAR	But despite her best intentions,\nCereza's gaze drifted back\ntowards Avalon Forest.
SM_000040_0060_NAR	This did not go unnoticed by Morgana.\n
SM_000040_0070_MOR	“If I've told you once...\nCereza, you must never enter that forest.”
SM_000040_0090_MOR	“With your current abilities\nyou would soon become a snack\nfor one of the faeries who live there.”
SM_000040_0100_CER	“Yes Morgana, I know...”
SM_000040_0110_MOR	“Well then, stop your dreaming\nand finish those chores \nbefore moonrise, young lady.”
SM_000040_0120_CER	“All right...water from the well, \ncoming right up.”
SM_000040_0130_MOR	“A simple 'yes' will suffice, Cereza. \nOff you go.”
SM_000040_0140_NAR	Despite her strict exterior, Cereza \nhad grown attached to her teacher.
SM_000040_0150_NAR	Morgana had also been cast out\nof the village.\nShe understood Cereza's pain,\nand her stern treatment came \nfrom a place of love.
SM_000040_0160_NAR	Cereza often reminded herself\nthat these chores were all part \nof her training.
SM_000040_0170_NAR	Eager to please her master,\nshe hurried off towards the well.
SM_000040_0180_MOR	
SM_000050_0000_NAR	After laying eyes on the full bucket,\nMorgana gave a small nod of approval.
SM_000050_0010_MOR	“Good. Now collect the herbs \nfrom the garden.”
SM_000050_0020_NAR	At the thought of herbs,\nCereza could not help but make a face.
SM_000050_0040_NAR	This is one job she wished could be\nforever stricken from her regimen.
SM_000050_0050_MOR	“Do we have a problem?”
SM_000050_0060_CER	“No, ma'am!”
SM_000050_0070_NAR	Trying not to think about \nthe task awaiting her,\nCereza headed towards the herb garden.
SM_000055_0000_CER	“Yes, I did it!” 
SM_000055_0010_NAR	Cereza was pleasantly surprised.
SM_000055_0020_NAR	She usually managed to make a mess\nwith even this rudimentary magic.
SM_000055_0030_CER	“I can't wait to see the look \non Morgana's face!”
SM_000055_0040_NAR	Cereza hummed a happy tune \nwhile picking the herbs.\nAs she bent down she noticed a \npretty flower growing amongst the weeds.
SM_000055_0070_CER	“Those flowers would really bring\nout the colour in Morgana's eyes.”
SM_000060_0000_NAR	Cereza proudly gave the basket to Morgana.\nIt was full to bursting.
SM_000060_0010_CER	“How about that, Morgana?\nQuite the harvest, wouldn't you say?”
SM_000060_0020_CER	“I also picked these violets...\nThey're for you. \nI thought you might like them...”
SM_000060_0030_NAR	Atop the herbs lay a small wreath.\nMorgana glanced down at it.
SM_000060_0040_NAR	Her expression unchanged,\nshe spoke to Cereza in her usual tone.
SM_000060_0050_MOR	“Do not expect praise for\nthis sort of perfunctory performance.”\n
SM_000060_0070_MOR	“Oh, and Cereza,\nyour hair today seems to have lost its sheen.\nDo not tell me that in addition \nto your outdoor tasks,\nyou are also neglecting your hair?”
SM_000060_0080_CER	“No ma'am, it's next on my list!”\n
SM_000060_0100_MOR	“Hair is the most versatile tool\nof an Umbra Witch. It can be shaped\ninto our armour, weapons, and even used\nas a medium for summoning Infernal Demons.\nAs blood flows through veins,\nmagic flows through a witch's hair.\nCare for it as you would your most\nprecious tool, and defend it as you would\nyour very heart.”
SM_000060_0110_CER	“Understood. I'll make sure to finish up\nbefore training starts tonight.”
SM_000060_0120_MOR	“Good. Now, get back to your chores.\nThe shadows grow long;\nthe moon will soon rise.”
SM_000060_0130_NAR	With this Morgana turned\nand walked back towards the house.
SM_000060_0140_CER	“Yes ma'am...”
SM_000060_0150_NAR	At times Morgana's cold\ntreatment got Cereza down.
SM_000060_0160_NAR	But she knew that\nMorgana cared for her,\nand only wanted what was best for her.
SM_000060_0170_NAR	Making a quick recovery,\nCereza resolved to finish her\nremaining chores in record time.
SM_000060_0185_NAR	That night...
SM_000060_0090_MOR	“Remember Cereza...”
BK_0020_0000_NAR	With the household chores complete, \nit was time for Cereza's \ndaily training in the dark arts.
BK_0020_0010_NAR	Today she was finally going to get\na chance to attempt a spell she had\nbeen practising for weeks:\nsummoning an Infernal Demon!
BK_0020_0020_MOR	“For today's training \nI will give you a little help.”
BK_0020_0030_NAR	Before even learning what it did,\nCereza was captivated by \nthe intricate brace.
BK_0020_0050_MOR	“This is a tool for those who\nhave yet to master the flow of magic.”
BK_0020_0060_MOR	“Furthermore, we train under the\nfull moon of the bissextile night,\nwhen the dark energy we Umbra\nharness is at its zenith...\n\nAre you listening, young lady?”
BK_0020_0080_MOR	“You seem determined today. \nPerhaps I should let you nap \nmore often.”
BK_0020_0090_CER	“Yes ma'am.”
BK_0020_0100_NAR	Cereza's spirits were high.\nShe was determined to succeed.
BK_0020_0120_NAR	Step by step Cereza flawlessly\nperformed the summoning dance.\nUntil...
BK_0020_0140_NAR	This looked like trouble. Unless bound by hair,\nthere would be no way to control the demon.
BK_0020_0160_NAR	The demon turned to ash \nmere inches from Cereza.\nWithout a proper medium,\ndemons will soon die in our world.
BK_0020_0180_MOR	“We are finished for today.”
BK_0020_0190_CER	“L-let me try again.\nPlease!”
BK_0020_0200_NAR	Morgana turned and walked away, \nignoring her pupil's desperate plea.
BK_0020_0210_MOR	“What kind of witch fears\nher own summoned familiar?\nI was foolish to think you \nwere ready for this training.”
BK_0020_0220_NAR	Morgana told Cereza to put away\nthe magic brace before\nheading back to the house.
SM_000070_0000_NAR	Long after Morgana was gone,\nCereza sat moping in the garden.\nOut of habit, she shared her\ntroubles with Cheshire.
SM_000070_0010_CER	“Forget returning to the village\nand saving Mummy. At this rate\nI'll never even become a witch.”
SM_000070_0020_NAR	All of a sudden, the words from\nthe boy in her dream echoed in her ears.
SM_000070_0030_LUC	“Cereza...give you...\nthe power to save...mother...”
SM_000070_0040_CER	“Avalon Forest...”
SM_000070_0050_NAR	Cereza's eyes wandered back to the forest.\nMorgana's repeated warnings\nleft little room for ambiguity. And yet...
SM_000070_0060_CER	“Morgana is always 'dangerous' this\nand 'stay away' that...How could a dank\nold forest be that scary a place anyway?”
SM_000070_0070_NAR	Adults do often exaggerate to\nkeep kids in their place.
SM_000070_0080_NAR	This thought got Cereza's blood boiling.\nGrievances started bubbling up.
SM_000070_0090_CER	“Nothing I do is ever good enough for her.\nDid you see those herbs? Flawless!”
SM_000070_0110_NAR	As she blew off steam to Cheshire,\nshe noticed Morgana's brace\nshining in the moonlight.
SM_000070_0120_CER	“W-what are you saying, Cheshire?\nTake the brace and sneak into the forest?!\nMorgana would give us \na right smack on the bottom!”
SM_000070_0130_NAR	Although, with the moon shining brightly,\nit was the ideal chance for a little\nsurreptitious forest excursion. 
SM_000070_0140_CER	“I mean, if I just had another \nchance to get the hang of it,\nI could have gotten that demon\ntotally under wraps.”
SM_000070_0150_NAR	With a demon by her side,\neviscerating a faerie or two \nwould be child's play.
SM_000070_0160_CER	“That's it, I'm going to that forest!\nAnd when I come back \nwith that fantastic power, \nMorgana will take back everything\nshe said about me not being ready. \nLet's go Cheshire. Next stop, Avalon!”
SM_000070_0170_LUC	“Avalon Forest...\nThe white wolf...guide you...”
PH_0020_0000_NAR	And so, Cereza threw caution\n(and her teacher's warnings) to the wind,\nand set out towards Avalon Forest.
PH_0020_0010_NAR	Little did she know that\nwhat lay waiting in those dark woods\nwould change her fate forever.
LV_000005_0000_CER	Something's there...
LV_000005_0010_CER	This place...
LV_000010_0000_CER	Why would you say that...?
LV_000010_0010_CER	Leave me alone...!
LV_000015_0000_CER	Jeanne, wait! \nI can't run that fast.
LV_00015_0010_CER	Jeanne, wait!\nYou make everything \nlook so easy.
LV_000020_0000_CER	R, right!
LV_000025_0000_CER	Just a little longer...\nHold on, Mummy.
LV_000030_0000_CER	Mummy!
LV_000035_0000_CER	What?
LV_000040_0000_CER	Nngghhh... nghh....!
LV_000050_0000_CER	No...!
LV_000055_0000_MOR	Cereza. Cereza-!
LV_000055_0010_MOR	Where are you, Cereza?!
LV_000060_0000_MOR	Cereza. \nHave you finished your chores?
LV_000065_0000_CER	Mmph...mmph...
LV_000070_0000_CER	Mmmnnh!
LV_000075_0000_CER	Erg...\nI just had to fill it right to brim!
LV_000080_0000_NAR	Fetching a pail of water...\nIt may seem like a simple chore, 
LV_000080_0010_NAR	but it requires a fine sense of control,\nmaking it perfect for Umbran training.
LV_000085_0000_NAR	The herbs in Morgana's garden were not \nyour common basil or thyme. She grew \nInfernal plants with an absolutely foul stench.
LV_000085_0010_NAR	They typically burrowed to avoid sunlight, \nbut a little bit of magic made them pop right up.
LV_000090_0000_CER	Dinner time!\nOne helping of magic coming right up!
LV_000095_0000_CER	Hurry on out!
LV_000100_0000_CER	Good!
LV_000105_0000_CER	Just a bit more.
LV_000110_0000_CER	There we go!
LV_000115_0000_CER	That's enough, right?
LV_000120_0000_CER	Blegh...I wouldn't mind\nif it weren't for this smell...
LV_000125_0000_NAR	Cereza shivered at the thought of what lay ahead.\nBut curiosity got the better of her.
LV_000130_0000_CER	Let's go, Cheshire.
IN_0000_0040_WIC	“What do you think you're doing!?”
LV_001025_0000_NAR	The pungent scent tickled Cereza's nose.\nIt was rosemary, often used to ward off evil spirits.
LV_001025_0010_NAR	As soon as the scent reached Cheshire \nhe pulled away, face scrunched up in disgust.
LV_001025_0020_NAR	It looked like demons could not stand \nbeing anywhere near the flower.
LV_000900_0000_NAR	[FONT:10 ]I'm in no mood for pests. \nGet ready for a face-full of claw![FONT:N ]\nThe demon leapt toward the faeries.
LV_000905_0000_CER	A chest...\nDid the faeries make this?\nI wonder what's inside...
LV_000910_0000_CER	He-hey! Give me a break!\n
LV_000915_0000_CER	Wow...\nJeanne, you're amazing!
IN_0020_0000_WIA	Why don't you just leave!
IN_0020_0010_WIA	Nobody wants you!
IN_0020_0020_WIA	Serves her right!
IN_0020_0030_WIA	What a burden!
LV_000920_0000_CER	“Mummy...?”
LV_000925_0000_CER	“What is this...? Don't come any closer!”
LV_000930_0000_CER	No one told me they could do this!\nI've gotta catch it quick!
LV_000935_0000_CER	Almost time for today's training.\nI'd better hurry or I'm in for another lecture.
LV_000940_0000_CER	My magic feels more powerful than before...\nCould it be the brace?
LV_000945_0010_CER	That was not fun.
Text/sidestory
BK_9000_0000_JEA	“What...What could this be?!\nCereza...No!”
BK_9010_0000_NAR	We have heard the tale of an unlikely friendship\nbetween a young witch and a lost demon.\nBut there is a secret chapter hidden \nin its pages that remains untold.
BK_9010_0010_NAR	Those of you who have read that tale to its conclusion\nmay recall this part of the story.\nIt is here the secret chapter begins.
BK_9010_0020_NAR	This is a story of two young witches\nwho were joined by a powerful bond.\nFrom this time forth, it must forever remain a secret,\nnever to be repeated.
BK_9010_0030_CER	“Am I...back in the forest?”
BK_9010_0040_CER	“Cheshire?\nWhere are you, Cheshire!?”
BK_9010_0050_CER	
BK_9010_0060_CER	“Where am I?\nCheshire?\nCheshire, where are you?”
BK_9010_0070_CER	
BK_9010_0080_NAR	Trapped within a strange void,\nCereza had been petrified by \na mysterious force.
BK_9010_0090_NAR	And as for Cheshire, he was nowhere \nto be seen. Could this too have been \nthe work of the faeries?
BK_9010_0100_SIN	“My thanks...\nThe faeries' power resonated through \nyour memories to guide me here.”
BK_9010_0110_SIN	“I'm surprised that one so young was able to resist my power.\nBut I shall have you before long.”
BK_9020_0000_JEA	“Cereza!”
BK_9020_0010_JEA	“Oh no, I figured she could handle \nthat forest without my help.\n...But this power is unlike anything \nI've ever felt before.”
BK_9020_0020_JEA	“It goes against all Umbran teachings,\nbut I have no choice.”
BK_9020_0030_NAR	For years, this young girl had protected Cereza,\nalways being sure to watch over her from afar.\n\nHer name was Jeanne, \nand she too was an Umbra Witch \njust beginning her training.
BK_9020_0040_NAR	Unlike Cereza, Jeanne lived in the Umbra \nWitch village. Though forbidden, she often \nsnuck out to meet her rival; the two never \nmissed a chance to compare strength.
BK_9020_0050_JEA	“I swear, that girl likes to keep me busy.”
BK_9020_0060_NAR	Jeanne's technique split her soul from her \nbody. She flew towards Avalon Forest.
BK_9020_0070_NAR	Jeanne had been warned about \nthe risks of Soul Projection, \nbut that stayed her hand nary a moment.
BK_9020_0080_NAR	For she aspired to surpass Cereza and become \nthe strongest of all the Umbra Witches,\na goal that allowed no room for cowardice.
BK_9020_0090_JEA	“I'm sure of it now...\nSomething is afoot in this forest, \nand it's not just the faeries.”
BK_9020_0100_JEA	“Cereza, where are you...?”
BK_9020_0110_NAR	Jeanne had successfully arrived \nin Avalon. The forest air was tinged \nwith a vile presence.
SM_009010_0000_NAR	As Jeanne proceeded through the woods,\nshe noticed something peculiar.
SM_009010_0010_JEA	“Is that...Cereza's stuffed cat? \nShe must be in trouble, I knew it!”
SM_009010_0020_JEA	“As I thought...this is no faerie magic!”
SM_009010_0030_NAR	[FONT:9 ]Who are you?[FONT:N ]\nCheshire's voice alarmed Jeanne.
SM_009010_0040_JEA	“Who's there?! Show yourself!”
SM_009010_0050_NAR	[FONT:9 ]Don't play dumb.\nYou trapped me in here, didn't you?[FONT:N ]\nCheshire said as he struggled\nto break free.
SM_009010_0060_NAR	But it took all his strength just to \nkeep from being swallowed. \nHe could barely move an inch.
SM_009010_0070_JEA	“You're...a demon?\nWhat are you doing there?\nWhere's Cereza?”
SM_009010_0080_NAR	[FONT:9 ]Cereza...how do you know the girl?[FONT:N ]\nEyes narrowed, Cheshire studied \nJeanne with new interest.
SM_009010_0090_JEA	“I'm an Umbra Witch...\n...apprentice, Jeanne.\nI've come to save Cereza.”
SM_009010_0100_JEA	“What have you done with her?\nGet out here and explain yourself!”
SM_009010_0110_NAR	[FONT:9 ]Hmph. Like I know where that brat is.[FONT:N ]\nCheshire said, trying unsuccessfully to hide\nthe desperation in his voice.
SM_009010_0120_JEA	“Wait...a demon, here...\nDid Cereza summon you?”
SM_009010_0130_NAR	Jeanne knew Cereza well.\nSeeing the demon-possessed stuffed cat, \nshe instantly grasped the situation.
SM_009010_0140_NAR	She thought for a moment,\nthen had a truly devilish idea.
SM_009010_0150_JEA	“I have a proposition for you demon:\nI'll get you unstuck, but in return\nyou help me find Cereza.”
SM_009010_0160_NAR	[FONT:9 ]Find Cereza...?[FONT:N ]\nThe demon eyed Jeanne suspiciously.
SM_009010_0170_JEA	“That's the deal.\nIf you say you'll help me, I'll move you \nto a body in a less precarious position.\nI have just the thing.”
SM_009010_0180_NAR	Jeanne produced a stuffed animal \nof her own: a handsome red stuffed cat.
SM_009010_0190_NAR	Compared to Cheshire's tattered felt,\nits velvet fur had a rich sheen. \nNevertheless...
SM_009010_0200_NAR	[FONT:9 ]Like I'd trust a human - you're all the same!\nYou won't trick me![FONT:N ]\nCheshire barked at Jeanne.
SM_009010_0210_JEA	“Fine by me. \nBest of luck then.”
SM_009010_0220_NAR	Jeanne turned her back on \nthe prideful demon, and prepared \nto set off on her own.
SM_009010_0230_NAR	[FONT:9 ]W-wait![FONT:N ] Cheshire yelled, \nunable to conceal his distress.
SM_009010_0240_NAR	And with good reason. \nIn a moment he would be \nsucked into that void for good.
SM_009010_0250_NAR	[FONT:9 ]All right, let me into that blasted cat!\nBut if this is a trick, you're lunch![FONT:N ]\nThe demon reluctantly agreed to Jeanne's plan.
SM_009010_0260_JEA	“Very well demon. Now...into the vessel you go!”
SM_009010_0270_JEA	“To think this would come in handy here.\n...Demon. Speak your name.”
SM_009010_0280_NAR	[FONT:9 ]I don't have one![FONT:N ]\nThe demon showed his gratitude the only \nway he knew how: an angry roar.
SM_009010_0290_JEA	“I see.\nThen I shall call you Charles.”
SM_009010_0300_NAR	[FONT:9 ]Charles?![FONT:N ] Perhaps the demon had \ngrown more attached to the name \n'Cheshire' than he cared to admit.
SM_009010_0310_JEA	“What's the fuss?\nAny name will do, right?\nOff we go now, Charles.\nWe've no time to waste.”
SM_009010_0320_JEA	That was sooner than expected.\nI've held up my end of the bargain. \nNow earn your keep!
SM_009010_0330_NAR	Cheshire was not fond of his new name,\nbut now was not the time: \nany protest would have to wait.
SM_009010_0340_NAR	Thus began Jeanne and Chesh-\nI mean, Jeanne and Charles's search for Cereza.
BK_9040_0000_JEA	“Cereza...!? \nIt's faint, but I can sense her magic.\nAnd she's not alone...”
BK_9040_0010_NAR	Something put Jeanne's nerves on edge.\nThis presence belonged to no faerie.
BK_9040_0020_NAR	[FONT:9 ]Look! Over there![FONT:N ]\nCharles had spotted something.
BK_9040_0030_NAR	Jeanne followed Charles's gaze.\nShe could see a small figure \nfloating in the distance.
BK_9040_0040_NAR	It was Cereza. \nShe was unnaturally still,\nfrozen by some unknown power.
BK_9040_0050_NAR	 \nJeanne looked at Cereza's face. \nIt was as pale as ice.
BK_9040_0060_JEA	“Cereza!”
BK_9040_0070_JEA	
BK_9040_0080_NAR	So close! Whoever was behind this \nwas determined to keep the girls apart. \nCharles bared his fangs \nand began to growl.
BK_9040_0090_NAR	The source of Jeanne's unease \nappeared before them now.\nHe was suspended in the air like a fell spectre.
BK_9040_0100_NAR	Fixed by his gaze,\nneither dared to so much as breathe.
BK_9040_0110_JEA	“You're the one who was speaking \nto me before. Who are you?”
BK_9040_0120_SIN	“So we meet again, my brave friend.\nOr, perhaps introductions are in order.
BK_9040_0130_SIN	Yes...You may call me...\nhe who affirms all phenomena.”
BK_9040_0140_JEA	“My, that's quite a mouthful.\nYou're worse than no-name over there.\nNo matter.\nAnyone crossing the Umbra will pay.”
BK_9040_0150_SIN	“Arch-Eve Origin.
BK_9040_0160_SIN	To think that her continued defiance \nwould bring me to this place.”
BK_9040_0170_SIN	“A slight miscalculation, but she \nwill be mine soon nonetheless. \nAnd then, I will affirm my world!”
BK_9040_0180_NAR	As he spoke, the spectre's eyes grew crazed.\nThey smouldered with a dark energy.
BK_9040_0190_NAR	But Jeanne and Charles did not back down.
BK_9040_0200_JEA	“What absolute poppycock.\nI won't let you lay a finger \non my Umbran sister.”
BK_9040_0210_JEA	“Return Cereza,\nor prepare to feel the wrath of the Umbra!”
BK_9050_0000_JEA	“What's the matter?\nDon't tell me you're giving up already.”
BK_9050_0010_NAR	[FONT:9 ]He probably tastes horrible.\nI better swallow him in one gulp.[FONT:N ]\nThe demon was already licking his chops.
BK_9050_0020_NAR	But the spectre was unphased.\nAs he got to his feet, \na faint smile crossed his lips.
BK_9050_0030_SIN	“You still don't understand, \ndo you Jeanne? What will \nhappen if you oppose me...”
BK_9050_0040_JEA	“How...how do you know my name?!”
BK_9050_0050_SIN	“I will show you, Jeanne;\ngive you a glimpse at what will happen\nif you continue along your current path.”
BK_9050_0060_NAR	Jeanne and Charles found they were unable to move.\nThe spectre had them in his spell.
BK_9050_0070_NAR	A moment later, a torrent of horrible visions \nbegan to flood into Jeanne's mind.
BK_9050_0080_JEA	
BK_9050_0090_NAR	It was a vision of Jeanne as \na grown woman... dealt a fatal \nblow by an unknown assailant.
BK_9050_0100_NAR	[FONT:9 ]Stop these stupid tricks! I'll rip you apart![FONT:N ]\nCharles tried with all his might,\nbut he could not move.
BK_9050_0110_SIN	“Jeanne.\nI have shown you a vision of \nthings to come. If you do not \ndistance yourself from her,\nthat future will certainly find you.
BK_9050_0120_SIN	 \nBut this fate is not yet determined.\nLeave now and it may yet be avoided.”
BK_9050_0130_NAR	The spectre rose once again.\nSuspended mid-air, he looked down on \nthem with his piercing gaze.\nHe slowly turned to face Cereza.
BK_9050_0140_SIN	“...Arch-Eve Origin.\nYou cannot resist much longer.\nSoon you will give me \nthat which I desire.”
BK_9050_0150_SIN	“Then, finally, phenomenal affirmation will be realised!”
BK_9050_0160_SIN	
BK_9050_0170_JEA	“...I told you. You won't lay a finger on my Umbran sister!”
BK_9050_0180_NAR	Jeanne stood tall in defiance.
BK_9050_0190_SIN	“Perhaps I was too soft.\nWitness your cruel fate, once more.”
BK_9050_0200_SIN	“You too...?!”
BK_9050_0210_NAR	[FONT:9 ]That pipsqueak made a promise to me\nshe has yet to fulfil. You can't have her![FONT:N ]\nThe beast gave a fierce roar.
BK_9050_0220_SIN	“Jeanne, you have seen what awaits you.\nYet still, you would face me...?”
BK_9050_0230_JEA	“I won't run away.\nI am going to be the strongest witch of all!”
BK_9060_0000_JEA	“Charles!”
BK_9060_0010_SIN	“...Perhaps I was not clear?\nI will achieve Phenomenal Affirmation!\nThe two of you altering that is a statistical impossibility.”
BK_9060_0020_NAR	The spectre's right hand began to glow with an icy glimmer.
BK_9060_0030_JEA	“Stop!”
BK_9060_0040_SIN	“Yes...\nThat is what you humans say \nin the face of defeat.
BK_9060_0050_SIN	And when those pleas go unanswered...\nThat is when you witness true despair.”
BK_9060_0060_JEA	“No...No...let go of him!”
BK_9060_0070_NAR	Charles screamed out in agony.\nThe spectral flames were slowly eating \nthrough his body, tearing him apart.
BK_9060_0080_SIN	“After I'm finished with him, you're next.\nI tried to warn you not to get involved...\nIt's a pity you would not listen.”
BK_9060_0090_JEA	“Cereza, wake up!”
BK_9060_0100_JEA	“Cereza...Cereza!
BK_9060_0110_JEA	Open your eyes, you fool!”
BK_9060_0120_SIN	“Impossible.\nArch-Eve Origin is under my spell.\nShe will not wake again, ever.”
BK_9060_0130_JEA	“Cereza, did you forget our promise?\nWe swore to become stronger...together!
BK_9060_0140_JEA	Keep your promise.\nIf you've any pride as an Umbra Witch...\nNow's the time to prove it!”
BK_9060_0150_NAR	The room was flooded with \na light as bright as a sun.\nFor a moment, everything around them \nseemed to dissolve in the radiant glow.
BK_9060_0160_SIN	“What...what is happening?\nArch-Eve Origin...\nCould she have awakened?!”
BK_9060_0170_SIN	
BK_9070_0000_SIN	
BK_9070_0010_NAR	The spectre's blood-curdling \nscream seemed to\nshatter the air itself.
BK_9070_0020_SIN	“This...is unfathomable!
BK_9070_0030_SIN	Jeanne...\nyou have made your choice...\n...That fate is now immutable!”
BK_9070_0040_JEA	“I will not fear my fate.\nWhatever may come,\nI will stand and face it.”
BK_9070_0050_SIN	
BK_9070_0060_NAR	His power extinguished, \nthe spectre's body flickered, \nthen faded away.
BK_9070_0070_NAR	As if in response,\ncracks and fissures burst all around them,\nand the world began to crumble.
BK_9070_0080_JEA	“It's...all falling apart.\nWas this all just his illusion?
BK_9070_0090_JEA	Cereza?!”
SM_009020_0100_NAR	The colour had begun \nto return to Cereza's cheeks.
SM_009020_0110_NAR	She was not yet awake,\nbut from the faint smile on her face,\nshe appeared to be having a pleasant dream.
SM_009020_0120_JEA	“I think she'll be all right.\nThey will be able to return to the forest,\nand...it looks like my time is almost up.”
SM_009020_0130_NAR	Jeanne's body had grown faint.\nHer technique had reached its limit; her \ntravelling soul yearned to return to her body.
SM_009020_0140_JEA	“Well Charles, which will it be?”
SM_009020_0150_NAR	[FONT:9 ]Which? What do you mean, which?[FONT:N ]\nCharles returned with a puzzled look.
SM_009020_0160_JEA	“I'm asking, \nwill you go back to that tattered doll,\nor shall I send you home to Inferno?”
SM_009020_0170_NAR	Charles blinked incredulously.\nHome...to Inferno?\nThis was something unexpected.\nDid Jeanne have such a power?
SM_009020_0180_NAR	For a moment, Charles simply \nstared at Jeanne, saying nothing.\nFinally, he spoke.
SM_009020_0190_NAR	[FONT:9 ]You think I'd trust you with that?\nJust keep it simple. \nPut me back where you found me.[FONT:N ]
SM_009020_0200_JEA	“I see.\nHave it your way.”
SM_009020_0210_JEA	“But come on, you must like \nthat body. Better than the lump \nof scraps Cereza drags around.”
SM_009020_0220_NAR	[FONT:9 ]Hmph, I hate them both the same.[FONT:N ]\nCharles grumbled in his usual \nirritated manner.
SM_009020_0230_NAR	[FONT:9 ]Besides, you're too rough for my taste.\nAt least the pipsqueak gives me a break \nonce in a while.[FONT:N ]
SM_009020_0240_JEA	“Heh, that so.”
SM_009020_0250_NAR	Seeing through his act, \nJeanne smiled at the flustered demon.\nShe used her Umbran Arts \nto grant his wish, and returned \nhim to his former body.
SM_009020_0260_CER	“Cheshire...there you are.\nI'm gone for a minute and \nyou get yourself lost again.”
SM_009020_0270_NAR	With a peaceful expression on her face,\nshe gave Cheshire a big squeeze.
SM_009020_0280_NAR	Cheshire sighed and furrowed his brow.\nBut somewhere deep down, he was relieved.
SM_009020_0290_JEA	“Farewell, Charles...no, Cheshire.”
SM_009020_0300_JEA	“And don't you dare tell Cereza \nwhat happened here. I mean it.”
SM_009020_0310_NAR	[FONT:9 ]I don't take orders from humans.[FONT:N ]
SM_009020_0320_NAR	[FONT:9 ]But, you saved me back there.\nI suppose I can make an exception this once.[FONT:N ]\nCheshire added softly.
SM_009020_0330_JEA	“If I didn't know better,\nI'd swear I was talking to a human.\nTake care of my friend, furball.”
BK_9080_0340_JEA	“Whatever lies ahead...I'll be ready!\nI'm going to be the strongest witch of all!”
BK_9080_0350_NAR	Thus concludes the adventure of Jeanne and Charles.
BK_9080_0360_NAR	We have seen how Cereza and Cheshire's journey went from here,\nbut what of Jeanne? What happened to her after learning of her fate?
BK_9080_0370_NAR	It may not be possible to change one's destiny.\nHowever, Jeanne's indomitable spirit and steadfast resolve\nwill surely guide her down a true path.
BK_9080_0380_NAR	Let us wish her success in her journey,\nand put this chapter away in a safe place.
BK_9080_0390_NAR	Forevermore, this story will remain our little secret...
LV_009000_0000_JEA	So this is the infamous faerie forest...\nBut there's something else here...I'm sure of it.
LV_009000_1000_JEA	The elder would really give me an earful if she knew I was here – whatever, I'm used to her lectures.
LV_009000_2000_JEA	Cereza, where are you?\nThat girl, always getting herself into trouble...
LV_009005_0000_JEA	What...is that?
LV_009010_0000_JEA	Elemental control? Impressive.\nFor a demon Cereza summoned, you're not half bad.
LV_009015_0000_NAR	[FONT:10 ]You know that little crybaby?[FONT:N ]
LV_009015_0010_NAR	Charles eyed Jeanne suspiciously as he spoke.
LV_009015_0020_JEA	Crybaby? Oh, you mean Cereza.
LV_009015_0030_JEA	She may blubber from time to time,\nbut look past the tears and you'll \nfind a truly spectacular power.
LV_009015_0040_JEA	Cereza and I have a duty to become stronger. \nWe must protect the legacy of the Umbra.
LV_009020_0000_JEA	That said...\nWell, I'm not surprised she summoned \na demon into a stuffed cat.
LV_009020_0010_JEA	And I dare say you seem to like it.
LV_009020_0020_NAR	[FONT:10 ]Like it?! I'm counting down the seconds \ntill she gets me back to Inferno![FONT:N ]
LV_009020_0030_NAR	Jeanne thought that Charles's\nfelt cheeks looked more red than usual.
LV_009025_0000_JEA	Cereza...She's close by, I can feel it!\nBut where...?
LV_009025_0010_NAR	Charles heard Jeanne but said nothing.
LV_009025_0020_NAR	Deep down worry weighed heavy on his heart.\nHe let out a sigh.
LV_009030_0000_JEA	What are these cracks...?\nFaerie tricks?
LV_009035_0000_JEA	What is this place?\nThe faerie stench is overwhelming...
LV_009035_0010_NAR	[FONT:10 ]Yeah, this place is always crawling with 'em.\nPerfect for a quick snack.[FONT:N ]
LV_009035_0020_NAR	The demon had learned a few things \non his journey, so he took this \nopportunity to show off.
LV_009040_0000_JEA	Wait...the cracks here...\nI can feel Cereza from the other side!
LV_009040_0010_NAR	[FONT:10 ]What?![FONT:N ]\nThe demon's eyes grew wide.
LV_009040_0020_NAR	What lay waiting on the other side?\nHad they finally found Cereza...?
LV_009045_0000_SIN	My brave friend...Leave now, I implore you.
LV_009045_0010_JEA	Charles, was that you just now?
LV_009050_0000_SIN	Go any farther and you will regret it...
LV_009050_0010_JEA	Who's there?
LV_009055_0000_SIN	I'll take no joy in watching you die...\nOnce is enough.
LV_009055_0010_JEA	You're hiding Cereza, aren't you?\nWhere is she?!
LV_009055_0020_NAR	Jeanne's voice echoed through the still forest.
LV_009055_0030_NAR	Whatever lay ahead would change her fate forever...
LV_009055_0040_NAR	Jeanne could not shake this feeling.\nAn inexplicable fear began to swell inside her.
CE_009800_0000_SIN	Resistance is futile.
CE_009800_1000_SIN	Now is the time for all to be affirmed!
CE_009800_2000_SIN	Now I've got you!
CE_009800_3000_SIN	Meaningless.
CE_009800_4000_SIN	Arch-Eve Origin will be mine!
CE_009805_0000_SIN	Jeanne, leave now. It is not too late.
CE_009805_1000_SIN	Are you prepared to accept your fate, Jeanne?
CE_009805_2000_SIN	You know what awaits, yet still you struggle?
CE_009810_0000_SIN	Very well...
CE_009810_0010_SIN	Have a taste of the fear that \nresides within Arch-Eve Origin.
CE_009810_0020_NAR	The spectre opened a scroll and \ncalled forth a faerie from thin air.
CE_009810_0030_NAR	Using the magic of the faerie realm,\nthis technique gave shape \nto the pain inside Cereza's heart.
CE_009815_0000_SIN	Aren't you dying to see what comes next?
CE_009820_0000_SIN	Arch-Eve Origin, show us more of your pain!
CE_009825_0000_SIN	I'm being struck by an oversized toy? 
CE_009825_1000_SIN	Incredible...you managed to cram a demon in there?
CE_009825_2000_SIN	What a pitiful attempt at a summon!
CE_009825_3000_SIN	Do not get in my way!
CE_009825_4000_SIN	You...stay away from me!
CE_009825_5000_SIN	You pathetic demon...You think you can best me?!
CE_009830_0000_JEA	Using Cereza's pain...what a cowardly trick!
CE_009835_0000_JEA	Stop playing with her memories, you monster!
CE_009840_0000_JEA	Your tricks won't work any more. Come on!

TUT_TUTORIAL_TEXT_w160	The distortion created by faeries\nis full of illusions. Use your magic \nwith [BTN:L2 ] to dispel the illusions \nand see through their deceptions.
TUT_TUTORIAL_TEXT_w165	Inside the distortion, you will need \nto use your magic to dispel the \nillusion which shrouds the faeries with \n[BTN:L2 ], thus opening them up to attack.
