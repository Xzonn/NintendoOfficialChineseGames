Hello there! Glad to meet you!\c\nWelcome to the world of Pokémon!\c\nMy name is Oak.\c\nPeople affectionately refer to me as\nthe Pokémon Professor.
[~ 1]
This world is inhabited far and wide by creatures\ncalled Pokémon.

Hey! You have Pokémon, right?\nCome on!\r\nLet’s battle ’em!
No!\nCaterpie can’t hack it!
Shh! You’ll scare the bugs away.\nAnother time, OK?
Yo! You can’t punk out on battle if you’re a\nreal Pokémon Trainer!
Huh?\nI’ve got no other Pokémon to battle with!
This totally stinks!\nI’m gonna catch some stronger Pokémon!
Hey, wait up!\nWhat’s the hurry? Why the rush?
I give!\nYou’re good at this!
Sometimes, there’s something on the ground\neven if you can’t see it.\c\nIf you’ve got a Pokémon with you, it may help\nyou find things like that!
Do you want to know the trick for throwing\na Poké Ball well?
Your battle was right on target!
Throw a Poké Ball to hit the center!\nYou know! The center of those two rings, right?
Hey, do you have a big Pikachu?
Oh no. Really?
I came here to catch a big Pikachu!\c\nYou heard me right. Look closely at the Pokémon\nyou encounter, and you’ll see what I mean!

Whoa!\nYou surprised me!\r\n...Oh, you’re just a kid?
Wow!\nSurprised again!
Kids like you shouldn’t be wandering around\nhere in the dark.
Did you come to explore the cave, too?
Losing stinks!\nIt’s so uncool.
I came all the way down here to show the girls\nhow tough I am!
Wow! It’s way bigger in here than I thought!
Oh! I lost!
How do you get out of here?\nIt’s so big, I may get lost.
What!\nDon’t sneak up on me!
My Pokémon won’t do!
I have to find stronger Pokémon.\nWhere might they be?
What?\nI’m waiting for my friends to find me here.
I lost?
I came because I heard there are some very rare\nFossils here.
There are suspicious characters lurking around\nin the caves.\r\nAnd you are...?
You got me!
But I really saw suspicious characters!\nI’m sure they’re from Team Rocket!
You need to go through this cave to get to\nCerulean City.
I lost...
Zubat are pretty tough! But if you can catch one,\nyou’ll be able to count on it.
[~ 42]
OK!\nI’ll share!
[~ 44]

[~ 47]
[~ 48]
[~ 49]
We, Team Rocket, are the Pokémon bandits!\nWe strike fear into others with our strength!
I blew it!
Oh man!\nMy associates won’t stand for this!
We’re pulling a big job here!\nGet lost, kid!
So you are good...
If you find a Fossil, give it to me and scram!
Little kids shouldn’t be messing around\nwith grown-ups!
Boy, that really makes me steam!
Seems that Pokémon lived here long before\npeople ever came.
Hey, matey!\c\nLet’s do a little jig!
Impressive!\nYou took the wind right out of my sails!
How many kinds of Pokémon do you think there\nare in this big world?
Ahoy there!\nDo you not get seasick on ships?
I was just careless!
My pa told me there’re 100 kinds of Pokémon.\nBut I think there are more.
I love Pokémon!\nDo you?
Wow!\nYou’re great!
Listen, listen!\nLet me be your friend, OK?\c\nThen we can trade Pokémon and do stuff.
I collected these Pokémon from all around\nthe world!
Oh no!\nI went around the world for these!
You hurt my poor Pokémon!\c\nI demand you heal them at a Pokémon Center!
You insolent pup!\nHow dare you barge in!
Humph! You rude child!\nYou have no sense of courtesy!
I wish to be left alone!\nGet out!
[~ 74]
[~ 75]
[~ 76]
Competing against the young keeps\nme youthful.
Good match!\nAh, I feel young again!
Fifteen years ago, I would have won!
Check out what I fished up!
I’m all out!
Party?\c\nThe cruise ship’s party should be over by now.
Which do you find to be more worthy: a strong\nPokémon or a rare one?
I must salute you!
Personally, I prefer Pokémon that are both strong\nand rare!

[~ 91]
Hello, stranger!\c\nI can’t tell if you’re from the seas or mountains,\nbut stop and chat.\c\nAll my Pokémon are from the sea.
Awww!\nI let that one get away!
I was thinking I might be able to hook you as\na fishing buddy, too!
Even sailors have Pokémon!
OK, you’re not bad.
We caught all our Pokémon while we were out\nat sea.
I like feisty kids like you!
Argh!\nLost it!
You’re all right, kid! You’re gonna grow up into\nan amazing adult!
You know what they say about sailors.\nWe’re all itching for a fight after ages at sea!
Right!\nGood battle, mate!
Hahaha!\nWant to be a sailor, mate?
[~ 104]
[~ 105]
[~ 106]
I wonder if you are good enough for me...
Apparently you are good enough for me...
I never wanted to lose to anybody, especially to\na younger kid...
I can see you’re good.\nLet me see exactly how good!
I was confident I’d win that one, too...
Tsk.\nI concede—you’re better than me!
If you can get through here, you can go meet\nthe Elite Four.
No!\nUnbelievable!
I’m pretty sure I can still beat you when it comes\nto knowledge about Pokémon!
This here is Victory Road.\nIt’s the final test for Trainers!
Achoo!
This place is full of tricky spots. If you get stuck,\ntry moving some stone blocks around.
Ah, so you wish to challenge the Elite Four?
You got me!
A boy named [VAR TRNAME(0001)] passed by this\nway, too, a little while ago.
Come on!\nI’ll whip you!
I got whipped!
You earned the right to be on Victory Road...
Is Victory Road too tough?
Well done!
Many Trainers give up their challenge here and\ngo home.
I heard rumors of a child prodigy.
The rumors were true!
So, it was you who beat Giovanni of\nTeam Rocket?
Trainers live to seek stronger opponents.
Oh!\nSo strong!
True strength comes from taking on tough\nbattles, you know.
I’ll show you just how good you are...\c\nJust kidding!\nTime you learned there’s always someone better!
Arghhh! This is the worst!
I guess it really is true...\nThere’s always someone better...
Only the chosen can pass here!
I don’t believe it!
All the Trainers here have their sights set on\nthe Pokémon League.\c\nDon’t let your guard down.
[~ 140]
[~ 141]
[~ 142]
[~ 143]
[~ 144]
[~ 145]
[~ 146]
[~ 147]
Who are you?\nHow did you get here?
Oww! We got beat bad!
Blast it... You’re dissing Team Rocket, aren’t you.
You snuck into Team Rocket’s operation?\nWhat nerve!
Boom!
You’re not going to get away with this, brat!
Intruder alert!
I can’t do it!
You’re looking for a Cubone? Hmph!\nI don’t know what you’re talking about.
What’d you hope to achieve by coming here?
This won’t do!
OK, I’ll talk...\nIf you wanna find the boss, take the elevator.
[~ 160]
Why...?
[~ 162]
I heard that you can see ghosts with\nthe Silph Scope.
I surrender!
The Team Rocket Hideout has four\nunderground floors.\c\nThink you can reach the boss?
Stop meddling in Team Rocket’s affairs, or else!
Oof!\nTaken down!
Looking for a Cubone, eh?\c\nI just saw one of our Grunts come by with one!\c\nUm... It’s gotta be around here somewhere.
Look who finally showed up, huh?\c\nWe got word from upstairs that you were coming!
What?\nI lost? No!
Go wherever you want, then!\c\nBut the elevator won’t budge without a Lift Key!
[~ 172]
[~ 173]
[~ 174]
[~ 175]
[~ 176]
[~ 177]
[~ 178]
No!
[~ 180]
H-help me!\nI’m a Silph employee!
How’d you know I was really from Team Rocket?!
To be totally accurate, I work for both Silph\nand Team Rocket. It’s hard to make ends meet!
It’s off-limits here!\nGo home!
You’re good.
Can you find your way through the maze here?\nIt’s not easy, I tell you!
No kids are allowed in here!
You’re tough for a kid!
Those bright blue tiles are teleport panels.\c\nThat’s how you get around in high-tech buildings\nlike this one.
Hey, kid!\nWhat are you wandering here for?
I goofed!
Silph Co. is gonna work with Team Rocket,\nwhether they like it or not!
If you get in our way, then you’ll...really be in\nour way!
I give up!
Fine, I guess you earned a hint!\nYou can open locked doors with a Card Key!
I support Team Rocket more than I support\nSilph Co.!
You really got me!
Hmph...\c\nTeam Rocket said that if I helped them, they’d\nlet me study Pokémon to my heart’s content.
Team Rocket has taken control of Silph Co.!
Arrrgh!
Fwahahaha!\nOur boss has been after this place for ages!
My Pokémon are my loyal servants!
Oh man!\nWhat useless servants!
The doors in this building are all electronically\nlocked. Without a Card Key, they won’t open!
Intruder spotted!
Who are you?!
This is not good...\nI better tell the boss!
I heard a kid was wandering around!
Shucks...
It’s not smart to pick a fight with Team Rocket!
We study Poké Ball technology on this floor!
Oh man!\nBlast it!
We worked on the ultimate Poké Ball—one to\ncatch even Legendary Pokémon without fail.
Whaaat?\nThere shouldn’t be any children here!
Oh goodness!
You’re only on 5F.\nThis building goes all the way up to 11F.\r\nYou’ve got a long way to go still, kid.
Show Team Rocket a little respect!
*cough cough*\nIt’s only ’cause I’m coming down with a cold!
*cough* Which reminds me.\c\nKoffing evolves into Weezing!
I am one of the four Rocket Sisters!
What?!
No matter!\nMy sisters will avenge me!
That rotten president!\c\nServes him right for transferring a star employee\nlike me off to the boondocks!\c\nThat’s why Team Rocket came after us—I’m sure\nof it!
Shoot!
Argh! I’ll be sent back to the middle of\nnowhere if I keep battling like this...
You dare betray Team Rocket?
You traitor!
You’ll never be on our side! If you stand for\njustice, you betray us bad guys!
Uh-oh!\nI found a little troublemaker!
Lights out!
You won’t find anything by just scurrying around!
Heheh!\c\nYou mistook me for a Silph worker?
I’m done for!
You may just be a kid, but...you’re pretty good!
I am one of the four Rocket Sisters!
Sorry, Sis! I lost!
Doesn’t matter.\nMy sisters will repay the favor!\c\nAnd if that thought scares you, go home already.
[~ 238]
[~ 239]
[~ 240]
This is as far as you’ll go!
Not enough grit!
If you don’t turn back...\nI’ll call for backup!
You’re causing us problems!
Huh?\nI lost?
So what do you think of the maze that is\nthe Silph building, huh?
I am one of the four Rocket Sisters!
Sis! No!\nDon’t give me a time-out!
My sisters will take care of you!\nYou don’t stand a chance.
Your Pokémon seem to adore you, kid!
Gaaah!
If only I had started as a Trainer at your age...
Your Pokémon have weak points!\nI can nail them!
You hammered me!
Exploiting weak spots does work.\nThink about type matchups.
I am one of the four Rocket Sisters!\nAnd I’m the oldest.
I’m the oldest, yet you beat me!
Argh...\nYou embarrassed me...\c\nMy sisters will avenge me!
Welcome to 10F!\nSo good of you to join me!
I’m stunned!
Nice try, but the boardroom is up one more floor.
Enough of your silly games!
No continues left!
Are you satisfied with beating me?\nThen go on home!
[~ 265]
[~ 266]
[~ 267]
Halt! State your purpose for being here!
Gaah!\nDemolished!
How exactly do you plan on beating us?
Who are you?\nThere shouldn’t be anyone here.
Ouch!
A key? I don’t know what you’re talking about.
[~ 274]
[~ 275]
[~ 276]
I can’t get out!\nThis old place is one big puzzle.
Oh no!\nMy bag of loot!
Pressing a secret switch should open and close\na door on the same floor.
This place is, like, huge!
Ayah!
I wonder where my partner went.
My mentor once lived here.
Whew!\nStrong!
It’s troubling when you can’t get where you want\nto go...\r\nTry climbing down that long ladder.
Uh-oh...\nWhere am I now?
Awoo!
You can find stuff lying around.\nThe residents must’ve left it.
This place is ideal for a lab.\nLook at all this space.
What was that for?
I like it here.\nI can get more research done if I live here...
This tunnel goes a long way, kid!
Doh!\nYou win!
In long tunnels like these, you won’t lose your\nway as long as you follow the darker patches\r\non the ground.\c\nThey’re darker because other people have\nwalked that way, creating a path.
Hmm...\nMaybe I’m lost in here.
Ease up!\nWhat am I doing?\r\nWhich way is out?
That sleeping Pokémon on Route 12 forced me\nto take this detour.
Outsiders like you need to show me\nsome respect!
I give!
You have potential!\nAre you interested in becoming a Hiker?
Pokémon fight!\nReady, go!
Game over!
Oh well, I’ll get a Zubat as I go!
Eek!\c\nDon’t get so close just because it’s dark!
It was too dark to see...
There are some Pokémon in tunnels, too.\nI saw a Machop earlier.
I came this far looking for wild Pokémon.
I’m out of Pokémon!
You looked cute and harmless.\nWas I ever wrong!
You have [VAR NUMBRNCH(00FD,0002)]a Pokémon!\nLet’s start!
You play hard!
Whew!\nI’m all sweaty now.
Do you know how you can avoid getting lost in\nthe mountains?\c\nYou can bend twigs as trail markers.
You’re stronger than I thought!
You won’t get lost in battle.
Hahaha!\nCan you beat my power?
Oops!\nOutmuscled!
I go for power because I hate thinking.
You have a Pokédex?\nI want one, too.
Shoot!\nI am so jealous!
When you finish your Pokédex, can I have it?
Um... Do you know about Pokémon cosplay?
Well, that’s that.
Cosplay is creating a costume, like a Clefairy\ncostume, and dressing up for fun.\c\nFYI, I am cosplaying as a Black Belt.
My Pokémon techniques will leave you crying!
I give!\nYou’ve got more technique than me.
In the mountains, you’ll often find\nRock-type Pokémon.
Even on a mountain like this, an Ace Trainer\nlike me exists!
Ugh.\nMy pride as an Ace Trainer...
Wherever we battle, Ace Trainers are strong.
[~ 331]
[~ 332]
[~ 333]
Hit me with your best shot!
Fired away!
I’ll raise my Pokémon to beat yours, kid.
I draw pictures of Pokémon when I’m at home.
Whew...\nI’m tired...
I’m an artist, not a fighter.\nI’ll go home to draw.
Urrg... Awaa...\nHuhu... Graa...
Hwa!\nI’m saved!
I heard that ghosts can be identified with\nthe Silph Scope.
Kekeke...\nKwaaah!
Hmm?\nWhat am I doing?
Sorry!\nI was possessed!
Be gone, malevolent spirit!\nAgh! Kwaaah!
Whew!\nThe spirit left!
The others above...\nThey must be possessed, too.
Ghost! No!\nKwaaah!
Where is the ghost?
I must have been dreaming...
I see...a bone and...crying!\nKwaaah!
What!
We can’t determine the identity of the ghost...
Huhuhu...\nBeat me not!
Huh?\nWho? What?
May the departed Pokémon rest in peace...
Give...me...your...all...
*gasp*
I was under possession.
Join...us...
What a nightmare!
I was possessed.\nMy skills still have a long way to go...
Zombies!
Huh?
I regained my senses.
Urgah...\nUrff...
Whoo!
I fell to evil spirits, despite my training\nin the mountains... Frustrating...
Destruction! Despair!
Uuung...
I feel anemic and weak...
Urff...\nKwaah!
Something fell out!
My hair didn’t fall out!\nIt was a malevolent spirit!
Ke...ke...ke...\nke...ke...ke!
Keee!
What’s going on here?

Hey!\nI saw you in Viridian Forest!
You beat me! Argh!
There are other kinds of Pokémon than the ones\nyou find in forests.
Hi! I like shorts!\nThey’re comfy and easy to wear!\c\nWow! You’re wearing shorts, too!
I don’t believe it!
Shorts are the cutting edge of current fashion!
Excuse me!\nYou looked at me, didn’t you?
You’re mean!
You shouldn’t be staring if you don’t want\nto battle!
Are you a Trainer?\nLet’s get to it right away!
If I’d had new Pokémon, I would’ve won!
You’re using your Pokémon Box, right?\c\nWhen you aren’t battling, you can switch the\nPokémon in your party with those in your Box\r\nmost any time!
[~ 705]
[~ 706]
[~ 707]
Hey! My shorts are cool, right?\nYou can stare at them!
Lost!\nLost! Lost!
I always wear shorts, even in winter.\nThat’s my policy.
I’ll battle you with the Pokémon I just caught.
Done like dinner!
Trained Pokémon are stronger than\nthe wild ones.
Eek!\nDid you push me?
That’s it?
Mt. Moon is just ahead. Lots of Pokémon appear\nthere, so be sure to stock up on Poké Balls back\r\nat the Pewter City Poké Mart!
[~ 717]
[~ 718]
[~ 719]
Who’s there?\nQuit listening in on us!
I just can’t win!
*whisper whisper*
Excuse me!\nThis is a private conversation!
Ugh!\nI hate losing.
*whisper whisper*
[~ 726]
[~ 727]
[~ 728]
Hahaha.\nI’ll battle you like a gentleman.
Argh!\nSuper annoying and frustrating!
Sorry, I lost my composure.\nYou’re strong...
Huh?\nYou want to talk to me?
This stinks...\nI couldn’t beat your challenge...
I should bring more Pokémon with me.\nI’d feel safer that way.
Me?\nWell, OK. I’ll play!
Things just didn’t work out.
I want to get stronger.\nWhat’s your secret?
I’ve never seen you around.\nAre you good?
You’re too good!
Is my Pokémon weak?\nOr am I just bad?\r\nWhich do you think?
You look good at Pokémon, but how is your\nchemistry grade?
Ow!\nMeltdown!
I am better at school than this!
All right!\nLet’s play a game!
Drat!\nCame up short!
Things didn’t work today.
You should be informed.\nYou need strategy to win at this!
It’s not logical!
Did I miscalculate...?\nDid I use a wrong move?\r\nHmmm...
[~ 750]
[~ 751]
[~ 752]
School is fun, but so are Pokémon.
You made it clear to me that I should stick with school.
I was planning on getting some fresh air for\na change, but we’re stuck here because of\r\nthe gates at Saffron City.
Meowth is so cute! Meow, meow, meow!
Meeeeyow!
I think Pidgey and Rattata are cute, too!\nI can’t make up my mind!
We’re showing off our Pokémon! Do you want\nto try?
Look what you did to my poor, cute Pokémon!
Saffron City’s gatekeeper won’t let us through.\nI know he’s doing his job, but I think he’s mean.
I’m a rambling, gaming dude!
Missed the big chance!
Whether it’s a game or a Pokémon battle—\nonce you start, you just can’t stop!
What’s a cute, round, and fluffy Pokémon?
Stop!\c\nDon’t be so mean to my Clefairy!
I read that Clefairy evolves when it’s exposed to\na Moon Stone.\c\nI read that in a Pokémon Journal.\nI wonder if it’s true...

You have [VAR NUMBRNCH(00FD,0002)]a Pokémon with you!\nYou’re my easy target!
You’re strong.
The tunnel coming up is pitch black inside.\nYou’ll need Light Up to get through there.
Who are you? That’s a nice Pokémon you’re\nwalking with.
Out like a light!
I’m so frustrated, I can’t even cry.
I’m taking the Rock Tunnel to go to\nLavender Town...
Can’t measure up...
Are you off to the Rock Tunnel, too?
Don’t you dare patronize me!
No!\nYou’re too much.
You’re obviously talented.\nGood luck to you!
Bwahaha!\nGreat! I was bored, eh!
Keep it coming, eh!\c\nOh wait.\nI’m out of Pokémon!
You sure had guts, standing up to\na Hiker like me there, eh?
Hahaha!\nAren’t you a little toughie!
What’s that?
Hahaha!\nKids should be tough!
[~ 800]
[~ 801]
[~ 802]
Hahahaha!\nBring it on!
Hahahaha!\nYou beat me fair!
Hahahaha!\nUs hearty Hikers always laugh even when\r\nwe lose!
Go, my super bug Pokémon!
My bug Pokémon...
If you don’t like bug Pokémon, you bug me!
Wow, you came all the way here?\nMaybe you’re a Poké Maniac, too?\r\nWant to see my collection?
Humph.\nI’m not angry!
I have more rare Pokémon at home!
I’ve been out at a Pokémon Gym a few times...\nbut I always lose.
Ohh!\nAfter all my training!
I noticed some Poké Maniacs prowling around.\c\nCan you imagine? Them?\nUp here in the mountains?
We Hikers are naturals at climbing mountains!
Phew...\nI’m worn out from walking through that tunnel.
*huff huff*\nWe Hikers aren’t prepared for cross-country!
Hi, kid!\nWant to see my Pokémon?
Oh no!\nMy precious Pokémon!
I don’t like you.\nI don’t like anyone better than me!
Aaaaaahhh...\nThis mountain air is delicious!
Aaaawww...\nI lost!
I feel bloated on mountain air!
I’m feeling a bit faint.\nI haven’t hiked in some time.
I’m too tired.\nI wasn’t up for it.
The Pokémon here in the mountains are\nso chunky...\c\nI wish there were pink Pokémon with a\nfloral pattern!
Win, lose, or draw!
Tsk!\nDidn’t go my way!
Pokémon is life!\nAnd to live is to play games!
[~ 830]
[~ 831]
[~ 832]
Let’s go, but don’t cheat!
Huh?\nThat’s not right!
I did my best.\nI have no regrets.
Hello!\nDo you use electricity safely at home?
You’re great. You beat me!
Spread the word to save energy!
[~ 839]
[~ 840]
[~ 841]
Fwahaha!\nI have never lost!
My first loss!
I try to think victory depends on the luck of\nthe day! Otherwise, I get depressed.
I have never won before...
I saw this coming...
I try to think victory depends on the luck of\nthe day... Otherwise, I get depressed.
I’m the strongest among my friends!
Arghhh!\nMy Pokémon need to be stronger!
There’s a fat Pokémon that comes down from\nthe mountains.\c\nI bet it’d be strong if you can catch it.
Hey!\nDo you always turn off lights?
Whoa!\nKids nowadays are so strong!
Well, better get back to work.
I raised my Pokémon carefully.\nThey should be ready by now!
Bye-bye!\nThank you, and good-bye!
Tch...\nI better go find stronger ones!
Yeah!\nI got a bite here!
Tch!\nJust a small fry...
Hang on!\nMy line’s snagged!
Be patient.\nFishing is a waiting game.
That one got away!
Even without a fishing rod, there’s still a way\nto catch Pokémon in the water.
I’m searching for a Moon Stone.\nHave you found one?
Oww!
I could have made my Pokémon evolve with a\nMoon Stone.\r\nI would have won then, I bet.
Electricity is my specialty, so I don’t know a thing\nabout Pokémon of the sea.
Unplugged!
Water conducts electricity, so you should zap\nPokémon from the sea.
The fishing fool versus Pokémon kid!
A touch too much to handle!
I guess you get to be good at what you like.\c\nWell, you beat me at Pokémon, but you can’t\ntop me at fishing.
I love fishing—don’t get me wrong.\nBut it’d be best if I also had more work.
It’s not easy...
It’s all right.\nLosing doesn’t bug me.
What’s biting?\c\nYou never know what you could catch!
Lost it!
What—Magikarp?\c\nI catch them all the time, sure.\nBut boy are they wimpy.

I’m told I’m good for a kid.
Ohh!\nI lost!
I want to become a good Trainer.\nI’ll train hard—just watch.
Wow!\nYour Badges are too cool!
Not enough!
You got those Badges from Gym Leaders.\nI know!
My cute Pokémon wish to make\nyour acquaintance.
Good going!\nYou totally won!
You have to make Pokémon battle to toughen\nthem up.
I gave my Pokémon a Quick Candy!
Oh, too bad!\nI just messed up!
If you give a Candy to your Pokémon, it can\nincrease your Pokémon’s stats, such as Speed.
I’m not going to lose.\nNot when the wind’s blowing my way!
The wind turned!
I’m beat.\nI guess I’ll go home.
Sure, I’ll play with you, sweetie.
You’re strong!
I wonder which are stronger, male or\nfemale Pokémon...
Do you want to battle some\nPokémon with me?
It’s over already?
I don’t know anything about Pokémon, actually.\nI picked the ones I use for their looks!
What’re you lookin’ at?
Oh man!\nStripped gears!
Get lost!
I always go with bird Pokémon.\nI’ve dedicated myself to them.
Out of power!
I wish I could fly like Pidgey and Pidgeotto...
You need to use TMs to teach good moves to\nyour Pokémon if you want to make them strong.
Not good enough quite yet.
Your Pokémon can use Secret Techniques?\nThat’s amazing!\c\nUnlike with moves, it will never forget them!
[~ 919]
[~ 920]
[~ 921]
You can buy TMs at the Celadon Department\nStore, too. Have you used TMs?
Aww, bummer!
Try teaching Pokémon a move that’s the same\ntype as it.\c\nThat apparently boosts the power of the move.
[~ 925]
[~ 926]
[~ 927]
Have you heard the legend of\nthe winged mirages?
Why?\nWhy’d I lose?
Well, the winged mirages are the legendary\nbird Pokémon.\c\nThere are three of them: Articuno, Zapdos,\nand Moltres.
I’m not into it, but OK.\nLet’s go!
I knew it!
Winning, losing... It’s insignificant under this\nhuge sky.
C’mon...c’mon.\nLet’s go... Let’s go... Let’s go!
Argh!\nLost! Get lost!
What... What... What?\nWhat do you want still?
I need to burn some time.\nShut up and battle.
What?\nYou?!
Raising Pokémon is a drag, man.
We come gather out here because of\nthe wide-open spaces.
Wipeout!
It’s cool you made your Pokémon so strong.\nMight is right! And you know it!
Pokémon battle?\nCool! Rumble!
Blown away!
You know who’d win, you and me one-on-one!

I’ll battle you with my favorite Pokémon that I\ntraded with my friends!
Not good enough!
You can’t change the nickname of any Pokémon\nyou get in a trade, even if you don’t like it.\c\nOnly the original Trainer can get\nthe nickname changed.
You look gentle, so I think I can beat you.\nI’ll give it a go!
No... Wrong!
I’m afraid of Bikers. They look so ugly and mean!
When I whistle, I can summon bird Pokémon.
Ow!\nThat’s tragic!
Maybe I’m not cut out for battles.\nI’m not the right type, I guess...
[~ 963]
[~ 964]
[~ 965]
Oh, you’re a little cutie!\nSo like a darling Pokémon!
I was caught off guard.
I forgive you.\nI can take it.\r\nI’m a big girl now.
I raise Pokémon for protection because I\nlive alone.
Pokémon aren’t about winning or losing for me.
I love having my Pokémon greet me when I\nget home. It’s so reassuring.
Hey, kid! C’mon!\nI just got these off some loser!
I don’t get it.
Life’s too short.\nIt’s cool to live as an outlaw.\r\nTeam Rocket rules!
Fork over all your cash when you lose to me, kid!
That can’t be true!
I was just joking about the money.\nDon’t take me all serious.
What’s cool and happening?\nTrading Pokémon!
I said trade, not battle!
’Cause Pokémon you get by trade grow faster!
Want to play with my Pokémon?
I was too impatient!
I’ll go train with weaker people.

Knockout!

[~ 998]

A long time ago, we used to ride bikes all up and\ndown this route...\r\nTch... So lame!
[~ 1004]
[~ 1005]
[~ 1006]
Whoa! You have [VAR NUMBRNCH(00FD,0002)]a great Pokémon!\nLet me see!

I leveled up my Pokémon, but it won’t evolve.\nWhy?
Why, you!
Maybe some Pokémon need certain stones\nto evolve.
I need a little exercise!
Whew!\nGood workout!
I’m sure I lost weight there!
Be a rebel!
Aaaargh!
Be ready to fight for your beliefs!
[~ 1036]
[~ 1037]
[~ 1038]
Please, would you have a battle with\nmy babies?
Even if they lost, my babies are still cute...
Thank you for battling with my babies.
Where is a good-looking guy who is with\na cute Pokémon?
Oops. Did I just say that aloud?
It makes it easier to talk to people if they have\nPokémon with them.
Are you a bad kid or a good kid?
No, you’re a great kid!
Pokémon Road used to be the Cycling Road,\nwhich wasn’t very safe. But it got much safer\r\nonce it became Pokémon Road.
Let me see your Pokémon!\nPlease!
I’m happy now.
I’m so happy to be able to see different\nPokémon of different people.
Do you want to battle my Pokémon?
Aahhh!
I’m looking for Pokémon friends!

I always check every grassy area like this for\nnew Pokémon.
Tch!
I wish I knew how to ride a Pokémon.
Kurukkoo!\nHow do you like my birdcall?
I should have stayed quiet.
The ocean’s close by, so I come on the weekends\nto enjoy the sea breeze with my Pidgeot!
This is my turf!\nGet out of here!
Bah!
This is my fave area for catching Pokémon.
I have to exercise and warm up before going out\nfor a swim.
All warmed up!
Thanks, kid!\nI’m ready for a swim.
Wait! Slow down!\nYou’ll have a heart attack!
Ooh!\nThat’s chilly!
Watch out for Tentacool.\nThey sting so painfully.
[~ 1081]
[~ 1082]
[~ 1083]
What’s beyond the horizon?
No land in sight!
I see a couple of islands over yonder!
I tried diving for Pokémon from the sea,\nbut it was a no-go.
Help!
I heard there’s a move in another region that lets\nyou dive underneath the water.
[~ 1090]
[~ 1091]
[~ 1092]
Oh, I just love what you’re riding! You’ll give it\nto me if I win, right?
Oh! I lost!
It’s still a long way to the Seafoam Islands...\nI want to go back to Fuchsia City...
Swimming’s great!\nSunburns aren’t!
Shocker!
My boyfriend wanted to swim to\nthe Seafoam Islands.
Ahoy there!\nThese waters are treacherous!
Ooh!\nDangerous!
M-my legs! They cramped up!\nUrgh!
I swam here with my friends...\nI’m tired...
I’m exhausted...
If I were to ride a Pokémon on the sea, I’d like\nit to be a Lapras. Lapras is so big, I bet it would\r\nkeep me dry on water.

The Seafoam Islands are a quiet getaway.\nI’m vacationing here.
Quit it!
There’s a huge cavern underneath this island.
I love floating here among the waves.\n...I’m a fish Pokémon.
Yowch!
Want to float with me?
Are you on vacation, too?
No mercy at all!
Seafoam used to be a single island in\nthe distant past.
Check out my buff physique!
Wimpy!
I should’ve been buffing up my\nPokémon, not me!
Wow, you’re riding on the water!\n...Could it be you can’t swim?
Ouch!\nTorpedoed!
Riding on the water like you do instead of\nswimming sure looks fun!
I rode my bird Pokémon here.
Oh no!\nNow what am I to do?
My bird Pokémon are exhausted.\nThey can’t fly me back!
My boyfriend gave me big pearls.
Oh no!\nMy pearls were in that Pokémon!
Will my pearls grow bigger\ninside Cloyster?
I swam here from Cinnabar Island.\nIt wasn’t easy, I tell you.
I’m so disappointed!
Pokémon have taken over an abandoned\nmansion on Cinnabar Island.\r\nThey call it the Pokémon Mansion now.
Cinnabar Island, to the west, has a lab for\nPokémon. My daddy works there.
Wait!\nYou’re supposed to wait!
Cinnabar Island is volcanic. I heard it rose out\nof the sea when a volcano erupted.
You want to know if the fish are biting?
Oh man!
I can’t catch anything good.\nNot one good Pokémon to be had!
I got a big haul!\nWanna go for it?
Heheh...\nMagikarp just don’t make the grade, do they.
I seem to only catch Magikarp!
The sea cleanses my body and soul!
Ahhh!
The sea is great and all, but I like\nthe mountains, too.
I caught my Pokémon at sea.
Diver!\nDown!
Where’d you catch your Pokémon?
Right now, I’m in a triathlon meet.
*pant pant pant*
I’m beat! But, I still have the bike race and\nmarathon left!
Ahh!\nFeel the sun and the wind!
Yow!\nI lost!
I’m sunburnt to a crisp!
Hey, don’t disturb the water!
Sorry! I thought you were disturbing the water.
I can’t fish like a Fisherman.\nCould this place actually be a giant pool\r\nor something?
Keep me company till I get a hit.
That burned some time.
Oh wait...\nI got a bite! Yeah!
What’s wrong with me swimming?
Cheap shot!
I look like what?\nA studded inner tube? Get lost!

I saw your feat from the grass!
I thought not!
I hid because the people on the bridge\nfrightened me.
OK! I’m number five!\nI’ll stomp you!
Whoa!\nToo much!
I did my best. I have no regrets!
I’m number four!\nGetting tired?
I lost, too!
I did my best, so I’ve no regrets!
Here’s number three!\nI won’t be easy!
Ow!\nStomped flat!
I did my best. I have no regrets!
I’m second!\nNow it’s serious!
How could I lose?
I did my best, so I’ve got no regrets!
People call this the Nugget Bridge!\c\nBeat us five Trainers, and win a fabulous prize!\nThink you got what it takes?
Woo!\nGood stuff!
I did my best. I have no regrets!
Local Trainers come here to practice.
You’re decent.
All Pokémon have weaknesses.\nEven the strongest ones.\c\nThat’s why it’s best to raise Pokémon of\ndifferent types.
Dad took me to a great party being held on\nthe S.S. Anne at Vermilion Port.\r\nIt was fun!
I’m not mad!
On the S.S. Anne, I saw Trainers from around\nthe world.
I’m a Camper.\nMy girlfriend is a Picnicker.
Aww, man...
Oh well.\nMy girlfriend will cheer me up.
I’m a Picnicker.\nMy boyfriend is a Camper.
My conditioning isn’t the best...
I wish my boyfriend were as strong as you.
I had this feeling...\nI knew I had to battle you!
I knew I’d lose, too!
If your Pokémon gets confused, switch it out.\nThat’s a good tactic.
My friend has many cute Pokémon.\nI’m so jealous!
I’m not jealous at all!
You came from Mt. Moon?\nMay I have a Clefairy?
I just got down from Mt. Moon, but I’ve still got\ngas in the tank!
You worked hard!
Drat!\nA Zubat bit me back in that cave.
I’m off to see that Pokémon fanatic guy at\nthe cape!
You done got me—and real good, too!
The Pokémon fanatic sure lives up to his name.\nSeems he knows about many rare Pokémon.
You’re going to see Bill?\nFirst, we battle!
You’re something.
The trail below is a shortcut to Cerulean City.

*pant pant*\nThat was a truly intense fight.
[~ 1483]
[~ 1484]
[~ 1485]
[~ 1486]
[~ 1487]
Heh!\nYou must be running out of steam by now!
I ran out of gas!
You’ll need power to keep up with our\nGym Leader.
[~ 1491]
[~ 1492]
[~ 1493]
Pokémon and I, we make wonderful\nmusic together!
You are in perfect harmony!
Do you know the identity of our Gym Leader?
[~ 1497]
[~ 1498]
[~ 1499]
A truly strong Trainer wins with style!
I lost my grip!
The Gym Leader will scold me for losing\nthis way...
I’m the Karate King!\nYour fate rests with me!
Ayah!
The Pokémon League?\nYou? Don’t get cocky!
Your Pokémon will cower at the crack of\nmy whip!
Yowch!\nWhiplash!
Wait!\nI only lost because I underestimated you!
The Viridian City Gym was closed for a long\ntime. But now, our Gym Leader is back!
I was beaten?
If you beat the Viridian City Gym Leader, you’ll\nbe able to proceed to the Pokémon League.
[~ 1512]
It seems I underestimated you.
[~ 1514]
[~ 1515]
[~ 1516]
[~ 1517]
[~ 1518]
Stop right there, kid!\c\nYou’re ten thousand light-years from\nfacing Brock!
Oops!\c\nLight-years isn’t time...\nIt measures distance!
You’re pretty hot...but not as hot as Brock!
This is the Pewter City Gym!\c\nTrainers here are a bit different from those\nyou’ve faced so far.
You’re quite different from the challengers I’ve faced!
Was it your first Gym battle?\nYou don’t look it, but you have a lot of guts.
[~ 1525]
[~ 1526]
[~ 1527]
[~ 1528]
[~ 1529]
Wow!\nYou’re too much!
[~ 1531]
[~ 1532]
[~ 1533]
[~ 1534]
[~ 1535]
[~ 1536]
Appearing in a glamourous flash!\nMy Pokémon will totally stomp you!
Blub blub...
I used up all my energy with my fantastic dive.
Hm? Me?\nI’m a beautiful girl who glides on the water!
I’m soaked!
My tears are making the pool water even saltier!
Did you see that dive just now? Don’t you think\nit’s deserving of a gold medal?
Your Pokémon totally deserve[VAR NUMBRNCH(00FD,0001)]s a gold medal!
This Gym’s pool uses water from the ocean.
[~ 1546]
[~ 1547]
[~ 1548]
[~ 1549]
[~ 1550]
[~ 1551]
Now that’s a shocker!\c\nYou’re the real deal, kid!
When I was in the army, Lt. Surge was my\nstrict CO. He was a hard taskmaster.
Stop!\nYou’re very good!
Are you having trouble reaching Lt. Surge?\c\nWhy don’t you check a trash can next to\nthe blue trash can?
I’m a lightweight, but I’m good with electricity!\c\nThat’s why I joined this Gym.
Fried!
OK, I’ll talk!\c\nI heard there isn’t a switch in any trash cans next\nto the red trash can!
This is no place for kids!\nNot even if you’re good at Pokémon!
Wow!\nSurprised me!
Let me give you a hint for the double barriers.\c\nAfter you push the first switch, you need to push\nthe second switch right after.\c\nThe two switches are adjacent to each other.
[~ 1562]
Blast!
[~ 1564]
[~ 1565]
Oh!\nI concede defeat.\r\nYou are remarkably strong.
[~ 1567]
[~ 1568]
[~ 1569]
[~ 1570]
[~ 1571]
Ahhhh.\nYou’re the one who I saw earlier!\c\nI’ll show you my cute Pokémon!
You’re too rough!
Nyahhh!\nI hope Erika wipes you out!
Oh, welcome.\nI was getting bored.
Give me a break.
Grass-type Pokémon are tough against\nWater-type Pokémon.\c\nThey also have an edge on Rock- and\nGround-type Pokémon.
...Weren’t you peeking in here earlier?
I don’t want to see myself lose!
Oh, you were looking at Erika...\nYou weren’t looking at me...
Look, look!\nSee my Pokémon!\c\nI like the Grass type.\nI like how they’re easy to raise.
No!
We only use Grass-type Pokémon at our Gym.\c\nWhy? We also use them for making\nflower arrangements!
Oh, hey!\c\nWe don’t like Bug- or Fire-type Pokémon in here!
Oh!\nYou!
Our Gym Leader, Erika, might be quiet, but she’s\nfamous around here.
What’s your hobby...?\n...Yes! Let’s battle Pokémon!
Oh!\nSplendid!
I have a blind date coming up.\c\nI have to learn to be graceful, even if I’m\nasked to have a Pokémon battle.
Welcome to the Celadon City Gym!\c\nYou’d better not underestimate the nice\nladies here.
Oh!\nBeaten!
I didn’t bring my best Pokémon today.\nWait until next time!
[~ 1593]
Hmph!\nYou have proven your worth!
[~ 1595]
[~ 1596]
[~ 1597]
[~ 1598]
[~ 1599]
Strength isn’t the only key for Pokémon.\nDo you understand this?\c\nPokémon battles are about strategy!\c\nI’ll show you how strategy can beat\nbrute strength.
What?\nExtraordinary!
So, you mix brawn with brains?\nGood strategy!\c\nThat’s remarkable for a child Trainer.
I was a magician once upon a time.\c\nBut I dreamed of becoming a ninja, so I joined\nthis Gym.
I’m done for!
Even though I’ve lost, I will keep training\naccording to the teachings of Koga,\r\nmy ninja master.
Let’s see you beat my special techniques!
You had me fooled!
I like poison and sleep effects, as they linger\nafter battle!
Stop right there!\c\nWhat do you think about the famed invisible\nwalls of the Fuchsia City Gym?
Whoa!\nYou’ve got it!
You impressed me!\nHere’s a hint!\c\nLook very closely for gaps in the invisible walls!
I also study the way of the ninja with\nMaster Koga!\c\nNinja have a long history of using creatures!
Awoo!
I still have much to learn.
Master Koga descended from a family of ninja.\nA tradition that’s lasted for hundreds of years!\c\nWhat did you descend from?
You’re more skilled than I’d thought!
Where there is light, there is shadow!\c\nLight and shadow!\nWhich do you choose?
[~ 1618]
I have burned down to nothing!\nNot even ashes remain!
[~ 1620]
[~ 1621]
[~ 1622]
[~ 1623]
[~ 1624]
[~ 1625]
Combustion occurs when the oxygen in the air—\n*mumble mumble...grumble grumble*
[~ 1627]
[~ 1628]
I surrender!
[~ 1630]
[~ 1631]
[~ 1632]
[~ 1633]
[~ 1634]
[~ 1635]
[~ 1636]
[~ 1637]
I heard when Blaine suffered an accident and got lost\nin the mountains, a fiery bird Pokémon appeared and\r\nrescued him by lighting up a dark path.
[~ 1639]
[~ 1640]
Yowza!\nToo hot!
[~ 1642]
[~ 1643]
[~ 1644]
[~ 1645]
[~ 1646]
Hwa!\nArgh! Beaten!
[~ 1648]
[~ 1649]
Hyargh!\nYou! Are you a challenger?
I give up!
You wait till you see our master!\nI’m a small fry compared to him!
I hear you’re good!\nI won’t hold back!
Judge!\nOne point!
Our master is a pro fighter.\nBe prepared to lose!
Hiyah!\nI have no fear for anything tough!\c\nI shatter boulders for training every day!
Yow!\nStubbed fingers!
The only thing that frightens us is psychic power!\c\n...Oh, and things that fly around.\c\n...And fairies. But that’s it!
Hwaah!\c\nYou’re trespassing in our Fighting Dojo!
Oof!\nI give up!
The prime fighters across the land train here.
[~ 1662]
This loss shocks me!\nBut a loss is a loss...\c\nI admit I didn’t work hard enough to win.
[~ 1664]
[~ 1665]
[~ 1666]
[~ 1667]
[~ 1668]
Sabrina is younger than me...\nbut she has earned my respect!
Regrettably, I have lost.
In a battle of equals, the one with the stronger\nwill wins.\c\nIf you wish to beat Sabrina, focus and will\nyourself to victory.
Are you scared of psychics that use\nunseen power?
I never foresaw this!
What are Psychic types afraid of?\nWell, there are a few things, I guess...\c\nGhost types and Bug types.\nOh...and Dark types, too.
You...must be a lost Trainer!
Lost and yet so strong...
You’re lost but still trying to reach\nthe Gym Leader, right?\c\nTry aiming for higher platforms.
[~ 1678]
[~ 1679]
[~ 1680]
You and I—our Pokémon shall battle!
I lost after all!
I knew that this was going to take place.\nYes! This ability is called precognition!
Sabrina is young, but she’s also our highly\nskilled Gym Leader.\c\nI won’t let you reach her easily!
Ow!\nDown and out!
There used to be two Gyms in Saffron City.\c\nThe Fighting Dojo next door lost its Gym\nstatus, though.\c\nWe simply creamed them when we decided to\nhave just one Gym.
The Saffron City Pokémon Gym is famous for\ntraining psychics.\c\nYou want to see Sabrina, don’t you? I can tell!
Arrrgh!
That’s right! The ability to read people’s minds\nis called telepathy!
What?!\nDid I lose?
What?!\nDid I lose?
Whoa, seriously?
Whoa, seriously?
I can’t believe it!
A twerp beat us?
Phew...\nOK, I feel a bit calmer now...
Phew...\nOK, I feel a bit calmer now...
Wh-whoa!\nI can’t believe it!
Wh-whoa!\nI can’t believe it!
Maybe your Pokémon are doing a little TOO well...
Maybe your Pokémon are doing a little TOO well...
Such a dreadful twerp!
But I was so confident this time!
What a blunder!
What do you want?
You’ll regret this!
[~ 1707]
Exactly what I’d expect from a Pallet Town Trainer!
Gaaah... Again?!
Wha—?!
[~ 1711]
[~ 1712]
As always...
Argh!\nI hate kids!
I’ve raised my Pokémon up this much...\nand still I can’t beat you, huh?
I’ve raised my Pokémon up this much...\nand still I can’t beat you, huh?
OK! I admit it!\c\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)], you’re the strongest Trainer in the world!
OK! I admit it!\c\n[VAR TRNAME(0000)], you’re the strongest Trainer in the world!
With my current skills, I was not up to the task after all.
Come on! What’s with that...?
I’m shocked at your strength!
I’m shocked at your strength!
How did it end up like this?
It’s not fair that you always win!
Argh!\nYou are good!
What?!\nThis can’t be!
Argh!\nI lost again?!
...Things shouldn’t be this way!
Why?\nHow could I lose?
Oh my!\nYou’re something special, child!
That’s it!\c\nI hate to admit it, but you are a first-class\nPokémon Trainer!
I knew you were strong, but this...
Hmph!\nHow annoying!
Absolutely shocking!
Oh!\nIt appears it is my loss...\r\n... ... ...
I won’t encounter a Trainer like you for around\nanother three years.
...If I am not strong enough to defeat you now,\nthere is but one thing to do. I must hone my skills.
Hah!\nI’m all fired up!
Aw man, what was I doing?
[~ 1740]
[~ 1741]
Argh! How?!
I have regrets!
Not bad!
How could I be pushed to such a point?
I knew it!\nBattling with you is the most fun, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!
I knew it!\nBattling with you is the most fun, [VAR TRNAME(0000)]!
You are good!
You won’t have any trouble going through\nMt. Moon!
Am I the one who was coached?!
You’re strong!
Way to go, youngster!
*tremble tremble*\nI tremble at your strength!
It was a great session!
I’m totally defeated!
Fascinating!
You’re strong!\nYou’re great!
Now I’ve trained you, too!
Seriously strong. So sick!
Well done!
Both you and I did a great job!
Wow!\nI’m surprised.
Overwhelming!
That move you used at that point in the battle...\nI never saw it coming!
Is this the power of the top Trainer?
When it comes down to it, you are still\nthe strongest...\r\nHaha, what am I saying...
Trainers’ eyes have met!\nI’ll battle you with my favorite Pokémon!
You’re really strong!
I’m sure there are lots of other Trainers on routes\nor in the forest that will want to battle you!
Oh, you have a partner Pokémon!\nLet me get a better look!
Before I knew it, I lost!
Maybe I should pick up another Weedle...
Hey, do you know if Bulbasaur appear in\nthis forest?
Could you listen to what I have to say, please?
I heard from a friend that they saw Bulbasaur\naround here.\c\nIt wasn’t registered to their Pokédex, though.\nI wonder if it was true.
What if the boss hears about this?!

I’m all about swim trunks! You could say they’re\nmy identity.
Puah!
Is that Pokémon you’re on wearing swim trunks?
Have a battle with me in this hidden place!
I lost...but no one was watching us, right?
Recently I was a coach, but I realized that being\nan Ace Trainer was best!
Your partner sure is cute! Let’s have a battle!
I’ve got to stop being fooled by cuteness...
All right, time to form a plan to distract other\nTrainers with cuteness.
I can catch a lot of Pokémon around here, so\nbuzz off!
You didn’t buzz off.
When you’re trying to catch a Pokémon, using\na second Berry will remove the effect of the first\r\nBerry you used!
How many Gym Badges do you have?
Uh-oh...\nYou were stronger than I thought.
There’s a Gym over in Celadon City! Do you\nplan on going?
You’re going to help me get stronger!
Can this be real?
I couldn’t beat Blaine, so I’ve been training here.
