ajito_fairy_040_jentle_07	As the former director of the academy, I believe\nI am best positioned to answer that question.[VAR 0114(003C)]
ajito_fairy_040_fairyboss_26	Mr. Harrington...[VAR 0114(0020)]
ajito_fairy_040_jentle_08	About 18 months ago, the members of Team Star\nconfronted the students who used to bully them,\r\nand an altercation broke out between the groups.[VAR 0114(003C)]

ajito_fairy_040_jentle_12	Just as I was puzzling over how best to deal with\nTeam Star in the aftermath of the incident, a\r\ncertain student came to see me.[VAR 0114(003C)]

ajito_fairy_040_nelke_07	A year and a half of studying abroad...?[VAR 0114(001E)]

ajito_fairy_040_jentle_19	Around that time, however, the former deputy\ndirector took it upon himself to erase all traces\r\nof the incident from the academy’s servers.\c\nIt appears his intent was to shield himself from\nany blame.[VAR 0114(003C)]
ajito_fairy_040_nelke_08	So he tried to cover up the whole thing?\nThat’s terrible![VAR 0114(001E)]
ajito_fairy_040_jentle_20	After we discovered what he had done, I dealt\nwith him appropriately, of course.[VAR 0114(003C)]

a_sch_entrance01_book_01_02	Yet behind the mural, what should we find but a\npair of Pokémon statues—one bearing a sword,\nthe other a shield! These statues, older than any\nartifact we’d yet discovered, called into question\neverything we knew about the legendary hero.

a_sch_entrance01_book_10_01	This month, we’re taking the scenic route over\nto Artazon to see Surrendering Sunflora by\nBrassius, the Verdant Virtuoso. This humble\ncolumnist wonders if ever a work has so aptly\ncaptured ennui and languor as this installation.
a_sch_entrance01_book_10_02	The sculptures are every bit as surreal as the title,\nprompting great minds to debate just what has\nsent these Sunflora into a state of surrender. But\nthough the meaning may elude us, the reader is\nurged to visit Artazon and see for themselves.

a_sch_entrance01_12_title	Status Conditions and Catching Pokémon
a_sch_entrance01_book_12_01	Dealing damage to a wild Pokémon makes it\neasier to catch in a Poké Ball, and inflicting\nstatus conditions on the Pokémon can make it\neasier still.
a_sch_entrance01_book_12_02	Certain status conditions will provide even better\nodds of a successful catch than others. Putting a\nPokémon to sleep or freezing it, for example,\nmay yield better results than inflicting poison,\nparalysis, or a burn.

a_sch_entrance01_13_title	Types and Moves I
a_sch_entrance01_book_13_01	You may be familiar with Pokémon that are\nGrass, Fire, or Water type. There are eighteen\nsuch types in all, and every Pokémon species has\nat least one type—some have two.

a_sch_entrance01_book_14_00	There’s a book entitled “Types and Moves II.”\nDo you want to read it?
a_sch_entrance01_14_title	Types and Moves II
a_sch_entrance01_book_14_01	When Pokémon Terastallize, their type becomes\ntheir [VAR FF00(0006)]Tera Type[VAR FF00(0000)]. That means moves of their Tera\nType will have their power increased. Moves of\nthe Pokémon’s original type will keep their usual\npower increase as well.
a_sch_entrance01_book_14_02	For example, if a Pikachu—which is innately\nElectric type—has Steel as its Tera Type, then\nupon Terastallizing it would receive boosts in\npower for both the Steel-type move Iron Tail\nand the Electric-type move Thunderbolt.
a_sch_entrance01_book_15_00	There’s a book entitled “Pokémon Natures.”\nDo you want to read it?
a_sch_entrance01_15_title	Pokémon Natures
a_sch_entrance01_book_15_01	Individual Pokémon have different Natures, much\nas people do. You may be able to get an idea of\nyour Pokémon’s Natures if you watch how they\nbehave on picnics—whether they run around a\nlot or nap a lot, for example.
a_sch_entrance01_book_15_02	Pokémon’s Natures influence their stats to a\ndegree. For example, Pokémon with Adamant\nNatures tend to have their Attack stat grow\nstronger than it would otherwise, while their\nSp. Atk stat may suffer.
a_sch_entrance01_book_16_00	There’s a book entitled “Fine Foods from Far\nAway.” Do you want to read it?
a_sch_entrance01_16_title	Fine Foods from Far Away
a_sch_entrance01_book_16_01	Have you chanced upon Pewter Crunchies, the\nfabled signature dish of the Kanto region’s\nPewter City? These snacks’ rugged, browned\nappearance makes them almost rock-like at\nfirst glance.
a_sch_entrance01_book_16_02	Indeed, Pewter Crunchies were inspired by the\nRock-type Pokémon for which the Pewter Gym is\nrenowned. Unfortunately, their forbiddingly\ntough appearance and surprisingly thin flavor\nhave kept them from attaining true popularity.
a_sch_entrance01_book_17_00	There’s a book entitled “Charcadet’s\nAdventures.” Do you want to read it?
a_sch_entrance01_17_title	Charcadet’s Adventures
a_sch_entrance01_book_17_01	Charcadet, the Fire Child Pokémon, may have\nbeen little, but did that stop it from being a\nmighty hero? Not one bit! When a mean Gengar\ncame along to play tricks and scare people,\nCharcadet stood tall! “Raaah! Hi-YAH!” it cried!
a_sch_entrance01_book_17_02	But soon, brave little Charcadet got bound up\ntight in Gengar’s looong tongue! How could the\nFire Child Pokémon get out of this mess?\nJust as things started to grow hazy before\nCharcadet’s eyes, the sound of a voice came...
a_sch_entrance01_book_17_03	“Two paths lie before you, young Charcadet,”\nit said. “Choose between these two sets of armor\nand assume a new form so you can defeat\nGengar!” And sure enough, two sets of armor\nappeared before Charcadet... (To be continued)

a_sch_entrance01_18_title	Of People and Pokémon
a_sch_entrance01_book_18_01	Far in the past, humankind and Pokémon lived\nin mutual fear of one another. But some humans\nwho loved and appreciated Pokémon made an\neffort to bridge this divide, and gradually, the\ntwo sides grew closer and found harmony.
a_sch_entrance01_book_19_00	There’s a book entitled “Student Registry.”\nDo you want to read it?
a_sch_entrance01_book_19_01	This thick book holds a thorough record of the\nacademy’s students and when they attended!
a_sch_entrance01_book_19_02	Wait, what’s this? Some of the recent pages have\nparts torn out, so you can’t read them!
a_sch_entrance01_ocalture_01_01	There’s a magazine entitled “Occulture.” It’s the\nSeptember issue. Do you want to read it?

a_sch_entrance01_ocalture_01_03a	In one arid corner of Paldea, there have been\nreports of a mysterious life-form. It’s said to\nresemble a Donphan at first glance, albeit one\nwith gigantic tusks, tough scales, and an\naggressive disposition.
a_sch_entrance01_ocalture_01_04a	Leading theories hold that this being is nothing\nless than a living relic of the dinosaur era, but\nno one can say for sure. Apparently, it’s called\nGreat Tusk after the name of a strange being that\nwas written about in the mysterious Scarlet Book.
a_sch_entrance01_ocalture_01_02b	Enigmas of Paldea, File #09\nIron Treads: An Alien Weapon?!
a_sch_entrance01_ocalture_01_03b	In one arid corner of Paldea, there have been\nreports of a mysterious life-form. It’s said to\nresemble a Donphan at first glance, albeit one\nthat can abruptly assume a spherical shape and\nlaunch into a swift rolling attack.
a_sch_entrance01_ocalture_01_04b	Rumors say this being is some kind of weapon\nusing technology not of this world, but no one\ncan say for sure. Apparently, it’s called Iron\nTreads after the name of a strange being that was\nwritten about in the mysterious Violet Book.
a_sch_entrance01_ocalture_02_01	There’s a magazine entitled “Occulture.” It’s the\nOctober issue. Do you want to read it?
a_sch_entrance01_ocalture_02_02a	Enigmas of Paldea, File #10\nScream Tail: A Billion-Year-Old Jigglypuff?!
a_sch_entrance01_ocalture_02_03a	Somewhere in a Paldean forest, it’s said, lurks\nScream Tail—a being with Jigglypuff’s own\nendearing puffball appearance but also a\nferocious aggression that leads it to attack\nanyone who comes near.
a_sch_entrance01_ocalture_02_04a	Its primitive appearance and savage nature have\nprompted rumors that it could be a Jigglypuff\nfrom one billion years ago. It’s named after a\ncreature in the Scarlet Book that is described as\nhaving a distinctive tail and scream.
a_sch_entrance01_ocalture_02_02b	Enigmas of Paldea, File #10\nIron Bundle: An Ancient Civilization’s Robot?!
a_sch_entrance01_ocalture_02_03b	The mysterious Violet Book makes reference to a\nbeing called Iron Bundle, which was said to look\nlike Delibird and to possess a spherical apparatus\nfrom which it would fire huge blasts of ice to\npropel itself through snowy lands.
a_sch_entrance01_ocalture_02_04b	Plenty of theories about it have been floated. A\nleading one suggests it is the product of a long-\ngone civilization—a notion supported by ancient\nwritings that describe the design and usage of\nmachines resembling Iron Bundle.
a_sch_entrance01_ocalture_03_01	There’s a magazine entitled “Occulture.” It’s the\nAugust issue. Do you want to read it?
a_sch_entrance01_ocalture_03_02a	Enigmas of Paldea, File #08\nSlither Wing: A Prehistoric Volcarona, Revived?!
a_sch_entrance01_ocalture_03_03a	There have been precious few sightings reported\nof the ultra-mysterious Slither Wing, a being\nwhose name is taken from that of a similar-\nseeming creature described in the ever-puzzling\nScarlet Book.
a_sch_entrance01_ocalture_03_04a	Slither Wing shares traits with Volcarona, so some\ntheorize that it may have been revived from\nfossils from a prehistoric era that we have\ndiscussed in these pages. However, no Volcarona\nfossils of that era are known to have been found.
a_sch_entrance01_ocalture_03_02b	Enigmas of Paldea, File #08\nIron Moth: A UFO Sent to Spy on Humankind?!
a_sch_entrance01_ocalture_03_03b	The name Iron Moth was borrowed from that of a\nflying object described in the era-defining Violet\nBook. It was said to resemble Volcarona and\nwould descend from the skies, following people\naround and occasionally even attacking them.
a_sch_entrance01_ocalture_03_04b	Some point to Iron Moth’s aggression as a sign\nthat it is, in fact, a UFO of sorts being controlled\nby alien life. Perhaps something out there is using\nIron Moth to observe us, waiting for the moment\nto mount an invasion...
a_sch_entrance01_ocalture_04_01	There’s a magazine entitled “Occulture.” It’s the\nJuly issue. Do you want to read it?
a_sch_entrance01_ocalture_04_02a	Enigmas of Paldea, File #07\nSandy Shocks: A Magneton with a 10-Thousand-\nYear Lifespan?!
a_sch_entrance01_ocalture_04_03a	Some scientists claim that this mysterious being is\na Magneton that has lived for 10 thousand years.\nIt has been sighted numerous times in Paldea’s\nmore arid regions, but there are no reports of it\never having been caught.
a_sch_entrance01_ocalture_04_04a	It’s said that Sandy Shocks is an aggressive sort\nand that some people who’ve seen it have been\nattacked as well. It takes its name from a beast\nwith a matching description in the era-defining\nScarlet Book.
a_sch_entrance01_ocalture_04_02b	Enigmas of Paldea, File #07\nIron Jugulis: Pokémon or Machine?!
a_sch_entrance01_ocalture_04_03b	This flying life-form bearing a resemblance to\nHydreigon has been seen in a certain corner of\nPaldea. It was reported to have razed an entire\nbuilding with a high-energy blast, then flown off\nas if to find its next objective.
a_sch_entrance01_ocalture_04_04b	Iron Jugulis is theorized to be a sort of machine-\nHydreigon hybrid, as it combines the former’s\nruthlessness with the latter’s ferocity. It takes\nits name from a similarly described entity in\nthe Violet Book.
a_sch_entrance01_ocalture_05_01	There’s a magazine entitled “Occulture.” It’s the\nJune issue. Do you want to read it?

a_sch_entrance01_ocalture_05_03a	This bizarre creature is said to combine traits of\ndinosaurs with those of the Pokémon Amoonguss.\nIt’s named after a fierce mushroom creature of\nmatching description that appears in the\nrenowned Scarlet Book.
a_sch_entrance01_ocalture_05_04a	Brute Bonnet certainly resembles Amoonguss,\nthough with its own unique twists: its gigantic\nstature and seemingly low intelligence combine\nto make it a savage, powerful fighter.
a_sch_entrance01_ocalture_05_02b	Enigmas of Paldea, File #06\nIron Thorns: A Tyranitar of the Distant Future?!
a_sch_entrance01_ocalture_05_03b	A strange being called Iron Thorns has been\nsighted in a certain cave in Paldea. This being\nbears a strong resemblance to Tyranitar, but it\napparently displays great coolheadedness and\nprefers to avoid unnecessary fights.
a_sch_entrance01_ocalture_05_04b	It appears to be highly intelligent and clad in\nmetallic armor, causing some to speculate that it\nmay be a Tyranitar as it would appear a billion\nyears from now. Its name comes from a similarly\ndescribed entity that appears in the Violet Book.
a_sch_entrance01_ocalture_06_01	There’s a magazine entitled “Occulture.” It’s the\nMay issue. Do you want to read it?
a_sch_entrance01_ocalture_06_02a	Enigmas of Paldea, File #05\nFlutter Mane: A Ghostly Pterosaur?!
a_sch_entrance01_ocalture_06_03a	Flutter Mane—a name taken from a strange\ncreature with a matching description appearing in\nthe Scarlet Book—is said to float around the sky\nat night with its long hair writhing about it.
a_sch_entrance01_ocalture_06_04a	Eyewitness accounts describe it as resembling a\ngiant Misdreavus at first glance, albeit a highly\nfierce and aggressive one. Some believe that it’s\na ghost of a pterosaur from a long-gone era.
a_sch_entrance01_ocalture_06_02b	Enigmas of Paldea, File #05\nIron Hands: Secretly a Cyborg?!
a_sch_entrance01_ocalture_06_03b	This being’s name comes from the one given to\nan iron-handed entity in the mysterious Violet\nBook. It is said to have fists that move\nindependent of its body and to be capable of\nthrowing large, fast-moving vehicles.
a_sch_entrance01_ocalture_06_04b	A leading theory holds that Iron Hands was once\nan athlete who became mortally wounded but\nwas kept alive by being made into a cyborg.\nWhy it so strongly resembles Hariyama, however,\nremains unanswered.
a_sch_entrance01_ocalture_07_01	There’s a magazine entitled “Occulture.” It’s the\nApril issue. Do you want to read it?
a_sch_entrance01_ocalture_07_02a	Enigmas of Paldea, File #04\nRoaring Moon: A Primeval Salamence?!
a_sch_entrance01_ocalture_07_03a	This elusive creature is called Roaring Moon after\na similarly described being in the Scarlet Book. It\nlooks similar to Salamence when they undergo a\ncertain phenomenon elsewhere in the world, but\nit’s unclear if there is any connection.
a_sch_entrance01_ocalture_07_04a	This creature scatters feathers as it flies around at\nhigh speeds seeking prey. It’s thought to be more\nsavage than Salamence, and if you should\nencounter one, it’s imperative that you avoid\nactual contact.
a_sch_entrance01_ocalture_07_02b	Enigmas of Paldea, File #04\nIron Valiant: An Experiment Gone Wrong?!
a_sch_entrance01_ocalture_07_03b	This oddity’s name is borrowed from that of an\nobject described in the Violet Book. One theory\nholds that it is in fact a robot—the product of a\nmad scientist’s efforts to create the most\npowerful psychic Pokémon of all.
a_sch_entrance01_ocalture_07_04b	According to its few eyewitnesses, Iron Valiant\nappears similar to both Gardevoir and Gallade.\nIt’s also said to be cruel enough to take its\nbrilliantly shining blade and cut down anyone\nconfronting it without hesitation.
a_xxx_g01_01	The rack is full of magazines about Pokémon!

a_w23_i11_01	We’ve determined that this energy crystallization\nis linked to the being we call ▉▉▉▉▉▉.\c\nThe interlocking hexagonal plates that comprise\n▉▉▉▉▉▉’s shell must somehow cause this\r\nphenomenon—which I’ve dubbed “Terastallizing.”
a_w23_i11_02	Thanks to my prototype Tera Orb, I secured\ncorporate funding for my research and made\r\na laboratory in the lighthouse near Cabo Poco.\c\nSomeday, though, I’ll return to the crater and\nresume my study of these crystals.
a_w23_i12_01	At last I can resume work on the Tera Project!\c\nI’ll move my research to the Zero Lab this month.\nMy team will be smaller, but no matter.\c\nThe strong influence of the crystals makes our\nexperiments much more unstable.

c01_school_03	This is the famous, torturously long staircase of\nthe academy! Not an easy climb, is it?
c01_school_05	Mesagoza is like a full table—it’s got the school,\nit’s got culture, it’s got everything!
c01_school_09	There are lots of different people and Pokémon\nat the school—and you’re part of the variety!
c01_school_16	Those Team Star kids are a little scary, don’t\nyou think?
c01_school_17	I hear that Team Star races around every night,\nriding on weird cars of some kind.
c01_northwest_06	You get to choose which classes you want to take\nat the academy, right? Schools are so different\r\nfrom when I was a student...
c01_northwest_10	Hello? Yes, the students here are just the best.\nA huge help to everyone, really!
c01_northwest_16	They don’t call it the biggest city in Paldea for\nnothing! I’ve gotten myself completely lost!
c01_northwest_17	The green arrow in your map app points north!\nTo lock your map’s orientation so that north’s\r\nalways at the top, press the Right Stick!
c01_northwest_27	The Pokémon League’s through that tunnel, right?\c\nThat’s where you get tested to see if you can\nbecome a Champion!
c01_northwest_28	I just had my interview at the Pokémon League!\nThe interviewer was real scary, though...
c01_northwest_32	Outside the city, you’ll run into tons of Pokémon\nthat you’ve never seen before!
c01_northwest_40	You know Tulip the supermodel, right? Well,\napparently she’s a childhood friend of one of\r\nthe teachers at the academy!
c01_park_01	There are tons of hills and cliffs up ahead. Be\ncareful not to get lost, OK?\c\nOnce you get through, you’ll reach Artazon, the\ntown of nature and art!
c01_park_07	A famous professor unraveled the secrets of the\nTerastal phenomenon.
c01_park_08	I hear the professor’s doing some amazing\nresearch at the Great Crater of Paldea...
c01_park_10	Each night’s sleep brings you one day closer to\nschool! So make sure to get lots of sleep!
c01_park_11	I wanna go to the big school too!
c01_park_16	Time passes, weather changes...\c\nI hear wild Pokémon behave differently too,\ndepending on the weather and time of day.
c01_park_20	This pond is huge!\c\nI wanna float around in it just like a Magikarp!
c01_park_25	I feel like school teachers always get weird\nnicknames from their students.\c\nI keep hearing kids mentioning names like\n“Old Hass” and “Brovatore.”
c01_park_29	Some Pokémon can’t learn certain moves!
c01_park_38	I wanted to get a Tera Orb of my very own but\nmy grades weren’t quite good enough...
c01_park_39	You have to be a good student to get a Tera Orb.\nThey’re too powerful to be given out willy-nilly.
c01_center_south_01	This is Mesagoza, the biggest city in Paldea!
c01_center_south_15	Sagu’s home ec is a really useful class to take!
c01_center_south_16	Ms. Rai’s history classes are so much fun!
c01_center_south_31	Now, which sandwich shop should we eat\nat today?
c01_center_south_32	Shops in the same chain still have slightly\ndifferent menus depending on their location!
c01_center_south_44	The Pokémon you see around town are usually\nsomebody’s partner. It’s best you don’t try to\r\ncatch them!
c01_center_south_93	My Pokémon’s really sensitive to sounds!
c01_center_south_94	Pokémon of the same species can still have\ndifferent strengths, natures, and even Abilities.
c01_center_south_100	Rain in Paldea isn’t that cold and it stops really\nquickly, so nobody here uses an umbrella.
c01_center_north_33	My son told me he’d joined some group called\nTeam Star. I have no idea what kind of sports\r\nteam that is, but I’m sure it’s very fun!
c01_center_north_40	Look at this battle court right here in the\ncentral plaza!\c\nIt takes a lot of courage to battle here, since\nthere’s always going to be quite an audience!
c01_center_north_41	I heard that other regions only have one\nChampion!\c\nIt’s really cool that Paldea has so many\nChampion-ranked Trainers, don’t you think?
c01_center_north_54	I’m not a huge fan of shopping online... Nothing\nbeats being able to see the product firsthand.
c01_center_north_82	Did you know? You can have up to six Pokémon\non your team!
c01_center_north_83	Any Pokémon beyond the six on your team get\nsent to your Boxes, right?
c01_center_north_91	If I gather up the materials dropped by Pokémon\nand trade them in for LP, I can buy what I want...\r\neven if I don’t have any money!
c01_center_north_94	Mesagooozaaa, the city of leeeaaarning! ♪\nI studied at the school, my passion buuurning! ♪
c01_stairs_03	The entrance hall of the school is full of books,\nand you’re free to read as many as you’d like.\r\nIt’s a great place for any bookworm!
c01_stairs_08	I’m a graduate of the academy, you know!\nI wonder if they still do that Treasure Hunt thing.
c01_stairs_22	The academy doesn’t have any age restrictions—\neven my grandma could enroll! Maybe this is a\r\ngood chance to redo my own studies!
c01_square_01	The west gate is this way! Head out from there if\nyou want to go to Cortondo!
c01_square_02	The west gate is down the other path—the one\npast the canned goods store!
c01_square_03	This way’s a dead end! All you’ll find down there\nis the Go-for-Broke Grill!
c01_square_14	I better get ready for the Treasure Hunt.\nNow where was Delibird Presents...?
c01_square_15	There are a few Delibird Presents in this city.\nYou’ll run into one if you just head south.
c01_square_16	It’s such a relief when there’s a Pokémon Center\nnearby. I like the music they play, too.
c01_square_17	You can use a Flying Taxi to get back to any\nPokémon Center you’ve been to before!
c01_southeast_04	So what’s the difference between a town and a\ncity anyway? Is it the size...?
c01_southeast_05	There are three big cities here in Paldea! One of\nthem is where we are now—Mesagoza!
c01_southeast_08	I heard there were unusual sandwiches being sold\naround here, but...where?
c01_southeast_17	Sandwiches are so good! I wanna have one\nevery day!
c01_southeast_18	Hee hee! Do you want to try making sandwiches\ntogether sometime?
c01_southeast_27	The north side of the city is mostly residential.\c\nSeems they don’t let you live in the student dorm\nif you’re from Mesagoza. Makes sense, really.
c01_southeast_40	It makes me so happy just to see someone\nwalking around with their Pokémon.
c01_southeast_43	I love sandwiches! But this store’s sandwiches are\na particular favorite!
c01_southeast_45	If you get a smartphone case at Delibird Presents,\nyou can change how your Rotom Phone looks!\r\nSo many choices... Which one should I go for?
c01_southwest_06	Once I catch my own Pokémon, I’m gonna\nbecome a Champion-ranked Trainer!
c01_southwest_12	Are star-shaped shades popular at the school?\nI saw a group of students all wearing them.
c01_southwest_19	Each town’s battle court has a different color\nand look to it, you know?
c01_southwest_23	That nice lady at the Pokémon Center always\ngives me little tips when my Pokémon get healed.\r\nIs it just me? D’you think she likes me?!
c01_southwest_29	I’m having my Pachirisu hold an item I bought at\nDelibird Presents!\c\nPokémon can get all sorts of perks from the item\nthey hold, you know?
c01_southwest_31	Good things can happen from time to time if you\nlet your Pokémon hold a Quick Claw!\c\nThey have ’em for sale there at the red shop!
c01_southwest_36	You can reach Cortondo if you head out the west\ngate and just keep going. They have their harvest\r\nfestival around this time of year.
c01_southwest_53	Bronzong is so soothing...\c\nIt lets me get inside it from time to time. It’s the\nmost calming, peaceful experience...
c01_southwest_60	Well, I’m completely lost. Time to boot up the\nold map app.
c01_southwest_61	Some meals here will fill you with Egg Power!\c\nThat’ll make it easier for you to find Pokémon\nEggs when you’re out on a picnic!
c01_northeast_04	You can exchange materials dropped by\nPokémon for LP at the TM Machine!
c01_northeast_08	Machines these days are so talkative! Even the\nTM Machine’s real chatty, don’t you think?
c01_northeast_09	Pachirisu’s Ability is Run Away! It’s real good at\ngetting away from wild Pokémon!
c01_northeast_23	Huh. Vending machines these days let you buy a\ndrink with LP too, eh?
c01_northeast_24	The staircase in front of the school is famous for\nbeing torturously long. I certainly don’t envy the\r\nstudents who have to climb it regularly!
c01_northeast_37	If you come across a sleeping wild Pokémon,\nthat’s a great chance to get the drop on it!
c01_northeast_38	Whenever I see sleeping Pokémon, I can’t stop\nsnapping photos of them!
c01_northeast_47	What was the new director’s name...Mr. Clavell?\nHe became director about a year and a half ago.
c01_northeast_54	Do you know Nemona, the student council\npresident? She’s such a sweet young lady.\r\nShe always says hi when she passes by!
c01_northeast_71	If you come across a beautiful view, don’t forget\nto snap a picture with the camera app.
c01_other_01_01	Are you also the type that likes to chill out on\nrooftops? Well, make sure you don’t fall off.
c01_center_north_99	You can buy academy-approved bags in various\ncolors at this shop!\c\nNow, which color should I choose...?
c01_center_north_100	I need to get my hair styled at Salon Renacer.\nCould you kill some time around here?
c01_center_north_101	Side part, romantic tuck...\c\nThey have some hair styles that almost sound like\nPokémon moves!
c01_center_north_102	Maybe I’ll buy some glasses at the Spec Shack\nand get a new, bespectacled look!
c01_center_north_103	I want to wear a stylish hat! But I also want\npeople to notice my hair!\c\n...Guess I’ll make up my mind inside the shop.
c01_center_north_104	If you get cold feet easily, you need some nice,\nthick socks—and this shop has a great selection!
c01_square_28	They’ve got fruit, vegetables, and even rice!\c\nSure Cans is where to go if you want to buy a ton\nof food and make heaps of sandwiches!
c02.dat
c02_bottom_02	Good thing we had our Cyclizar to get us across\nthe Asado Desert!
c02_bottom_03	Let’s give both our Cyclizar a nice wash to clean\noff all that sand.
c02_bottom_08	I love my Marill just the way she is, so whenever\nshe starts to evolve, I do a lucky chant to stop it.\c\n“B Button! Put the brakes on this Evolution!”\nIt works every time!
c02_bottom_16	Cascarrafa’s battle court is sunk right into\nthe river!
c02_bottom_18	If you want to head to the upper tiers, just wait\nin front of the elevator here for a moment.
c02_bottom_19	The river gets pretty deep up ahead! ’Course, if\nyou can move across the water, you’re all set!
c02_bottom_20	Porto Marinada is across this desert! Make sure\nyou’re prepared for the trip if you plan to go.
c02_bottom_31	I...I saw a tiny little Pokémon holding a coin!\nWhen I got close, it dropped the coin and ran!\r\nWhat even WAS that thing?
c02_bottom_40	Maybe I should buy something for my Pokémon\nbefore heading home...
c02_bottom_41	Why don’t Pokémon like to eat the same things\nI like to eat? I don’t get it.
c02_bottom_53	The walls look just like cascades of water! I bet\nthey could help train Pokémon to use Waterfall!
c02_bottom_54	Coming from Zapapico, I’m amazed to see how\nmuch water there is around here!\c\nIt’s a precious resource where I’m from.
c02_bottom_60	Marill really love the water! They’re Water-type\nPokémon after all!
c02_bottom_70	Whenever I can’t decide what to eat, I always\nfind myself coming to Jade Palace Garden.
c02_center_01	This spot is for Cyclizar to rest and recharge.\c\nIt’s the least we can do to thank them for carrying\nus around.
c02_center_02	They call Cascarrafa the City of Water! I’m sure\nyou can see why!
c02_center_14	The restaurants here are supposed to be really\ngood! I hear it’s because most of ’em use fresh\r\ningredients brought in from Porto Marinada!
c02_center_29	I want to travel all over the place and take lots of\nphotos while I’m still young.\c\nWhen I’m a little old grandma, I’ll look through\nthem all and remember the good ol’ days.
c02_center_45	Seems like the Kofu Lounge is the most renowned\neatery in Cascarrafa!
c02_center_46	I want to go to the sandwich restaurant on the\nupper level!
c02_center_50	I’m clueless when it comes to map reading...\nWhich way is north again?
c02_center_51	North is shown by the green arc in your map app.\nWhy not try locking it so north always points up?
c02_center_68	Cascarrafa was built on the side of these cliffs!\nThat’s why the city has multiple tiers.
c02_center_98	Hoo boy, what a shopping spree! Where should\nwe head to next?
c02_center_99	Let’s hit the market in Porto Marinada and shop\ntill we drop!
c02_center_111	Oh, Cascarrafa, city of waterrr... ♪\nCarafes are vessels for water, etceteraaa! ♪
c02_center_118	I heard that before they installed elevators here,\nyou had to ride Cyclizar up and down these cliffs\r\nto reach the different tiers! Sounds rough!
c02_center_127	It seems only especially talented people are\nallowed to have one of those Tera Orbs that let\r\nyou Terastallize Pokémon.
c02_center_128	They say that Pokémon can only Terastallize in\nPaldea. Now why on earth might that be?
c02_center_143	Regular folk like us aren’t allowed to set foot\ninside the Great Crater of Paldea...\c\nI wonder what kind of Pokémon are down there?
c02_center_151	Stop on by the Kofu Lounge! The renowned\nrestaurant of Gym Leader Kofu is right here!
c02_center_165	People love coming to Cascarrafa to take photos.\nIt’s such a beautiful city!
c02_center_169	You’re going to school next year, too, right?\nYou think we’ll make lotsa friends?
c02_center_170	I can’t wait to live in the school dorms! I won’t\nget told off for eating candy before bed!
c02_top_01	Tourists started flocking here after we added lots\nof blue around the city.\c\nThe idea apparently came from Kofu himself\na few years ago.
c02_top_07	Every kind of sandwich, any way you want!\nCome on over to Every Wich Way!
c02_top_22	Cascarrafa’s Gym Test is a real doozy!
c02_top_23	Kofu is the face of Cascarrafa! He’s usually a\nmild, easygoing guy, but he shows off his cool\r\nside when he’s doing his Gym Leader thing!
c02_top_31	I’d love to do a big bicycle trip sometime, but\nPaldea has too many mountains and valleys.
c02_top_32	I heard they ride Pokémon other than Cyclizar\nin other regions. Wonder if that’s true?
c02_top_36	I’ve worked my tail off this month... That means\nI can treat myself to a designer handbag, right?
c02_top_38	I fancied trying out a new style, so I changed up\nmy hair! Don’t you think it suits me?
c02_top_39	Errr... Did you get your bangs trimmed?

c03_south_01	How are you liking Levincia? Business and tech\nare what we pride ourselves on!
c03_south_13	The city’s main street is just north of here!\c\nNothing says “Wow, I’m in Levincia!” like being\nslapdab in the middle of all those neon signs.
c03_south_37	Since we wear socks day in, day out, they just\ngotta be comfy as can be!
c03_south_38	I don’t care if a bag can’t fit much inside, as long\nas it’s stylish!
c03_south_39	So this is Iono’s Gym... I’ve seen it in her videos\nso many times—I can’t believe I’m actually here!
c03_south_43	Did you see the latest episode of Iono Zone?\nThat collab with Tulip was great!
c03_south_44	Iono’s super cute, isn’t she? She’s the most\npopular streamer around, hands down!
c03_south_56	Having greenery around the city is good for our\nwell-being. Sure helps me feel less stressed.
c03_south_57	Life in Levincia is exhilarating. There’s always\nsomething going on!
c03_south_85	Right! Ultra Balls—you got it!\c\nYup, they outperform Great Balls on all counts,\nso I’ll go ahead and put in an order for 300!
c03_south_86	When I grow up, I wanna be an inflooenser too!
c03_south_87	You can make a living doing all sorts of things\nthese days!
c03_south_127	I went to make a sandwich, but I’d run clean out\nof picks! Would you believe it? I go through ’em\r\nso fast, I’d better buy ’em in bulk from now on.
c03_south_147	I could go for the Treasure Eatery in Medali, but\nCascarrafa’s Kofu Lounge also sounds good.\r\nShould we call a Flying Taxi?
c03_south_148	I’m headed out to catch Pokémon later, so I want\nto eat something that’ll give me Catching Power!
c03_center_06	I’m gonna wait till that Pokémon’s flying riiight\nover the ocean, and theeen...SNAP!
c03_center_30	There’s boats ’n’ stuff down there! I wish I could\nsail to the bottom of the sea!
c03_center_39	Levincia feels nice and safe thanks to all the\nsecurity cameras about the place!\c\nI hear the footage they capture is used for the\nGym Test.
c03_center_51	Pottery classes in Alfornada—I’m telling you,\nthat should be our next big project!
c03_center_65	Livestreamed Pokémon battles can be fun to\nwatch, but I want to see them in person, too!
c03_center_69	Ryme’s new track just dropped! I gotta check it\nout ASAP!
c03_center_70	Everything in Tulip’s limited-edition line of\nmakeup is so lovely! I’m spoiled for choice!
c03_center_73	These skyscrapers are crazy tall! My neck hurts\njust trying to take ’em all in!
c03_center_74	Apparently, all five of these buildings are owned\nby a real estate firm called Paldea Realty.
c03_center_78	This city’s electricity is generated by a species of\nPokémon called Tadbulb! What hard workers!
c03_center_79	M-my idol! He’s on the neon signs!!! He pops up\non one screen, then the next...then ANOTHER!\r\nOooh, Brassius...I’m your biggest fan!!!
c03_center_90	You can use a TM Machine to create any TM that\nyou’ve ever gotten before!
c03_center_99	If you had a Pokémon you could ride over water,\nyou could leap into the ocean without a care!
c03_center_100	Levincia started out as a port town that shipped\nore from the mines to various other places.\c\nIt’s hard to believe that humble port went on to\nbecome the high-flying business hub it is today!
c03_center_110	Where did the name Levincia come from? Is it\nfrom that old word “levin”? Or “leviathan”?\c\nOr maybe, ’cause the city has all these soaring\nbuildings in its Million Volt Skyline, could it be\r\nfrom “leaven”? Like, you know, rising bread?
c03_north_21	You remember that famous professor? Haven’t\nseen h[VAR 1107(00FF,0202)]erim on TV or in the papers for a while...
c03_north_22	I heard [VAR 1107(00FF,0001)]she has some sort of lab at the base of\nthe lighthouse over by Cabo Poco.
c03_north_28	Changing up your look also changes up your\nwhole mood!\c\nYour day can go all sorts of ways depending on\nthe clothes you wear.
c03_north_40	OK, we got Potions, sandwich ingredients,\nPoké Balls... Hope we didn’t forget anything!
c03_north_41	We can always take a Flying Taxi back to the\nPoké Mart if we need to.
c03_north_42	[~]
c03_north_71	Iono started out as a streamer quite a few years\nago now... Just how old is she, anyway?
c03_north_75	My Luxio’s fur has a nice sheen to it, huh?\nI always give it a wash first thing after a battle.
c03_north_79	One day, when I’m all grown up and rich, I’ll say\nto the shop man “I’ll take the lot!”
c03_north_86	*munch munch*\c\nI heard the Levincia Gym livestreams the Gym\nTests of all its challengers!
c03_north_87	*gulp gulp*\c\nI watched the Gym’s livestream of a Trainer\nnamed Nemona. Her Pokémon were awesome!
c03_north_95	I heard the academy has mountains of books!\c\nWhen I start studying there, I’m gonna read every\nsingle issue of Occulture!
c03_north_103	If you climb the lighthouse up ahead, you’ll get\na great view over the whole city of Levincia!
c03_north_106	I like photos of scenic places as much as anyone,\nbut the most memorable photos for me are\r\nalways ones of people or Pokémon.

champ_0260_chairman_05	You see, I have a trait that some might say is\ninappropriate for the League Chairwoman...[VAR 0114(0011)]
champ_0260_chairman_06	I am utterly incapable of holding back when it\ncomes to Pokémon battles.[VAR 0114(0011)]
champ_0260_chairman_07	Maybe that’s why nobody’s passed this test\nrecently. It’s a bit of a problem, to be honest.[VAR 0114(0011)]
champ_0260_chairman_08	But you... You might manage something\nwonderful, like Champion Nemona did.[VAR 0114(0011)]
champ_0260_chairman_09	So, are you ready for your final test?[VAR 0114(0011)]
champ_0260_chairman_10	I want to see the true measure of your talent![VAR 0114(0011)]

champ_0270_rival_15	Hmm... Now that you mention it, that’s a\ngood point.[VAR 0114(0004)]
champ_0270_rival_16	In that case, can we use one of the Pokémon\nLeague battle courts?[VAR 0114(0004)]

champ_0270_rival_answer_a03	Anyplace else come to mind?[VAR 0114(0004)]
champ_0270_chairman_answer_c01	The Treasure Eatery? Is it significant to the two of\nyou somehow?[VAR 0114(0011)]
champ_0270_chairman_answer_c02	Ah, are you thinking of it ’cause it’s got the\nMedali Gym’s battle court?\c\nI guess it does bring back memories...of Larry...[VAR 0114(0004)]

champ_0270_chairman_06	The respect you two share is palpable. Even a bit\nenviable, to be honest.[VAR 0114(0011)]
champ_0270_chairman_07	I am known as La Primera—but even when facing\nme in the final test of her Champion Assessment,\r\nChampion Nemona didn’t reveal her full might.[VAR 0114(0011)]

class_a_01_ecology_01	Hello, hello. My name’s Jacq, and I’ll be your\nPokémon biology teacher.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_01_ecology_02	In my class, we’ll all learn about the various\nquirks of our beloved Pokémon together![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_01_ecology_03	I hope you all come to love Pokémon even more\nfrom the things you learn here.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_01_ecology_04	In today’s class, I’ll teach you a great way to\nget to know Pokémon in more depth.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_01_ecology_05	If you’d like to become better friends with your\nPokémon...[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_01_ecology_06	you can let them come out of their Poké Ball\nand walk along with you! Sounds great, huh?[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_01_ecology_07	You can use the [VAR FF00(0006)]ZR Button[VAR FF00(0000)] to throw a Poké Ball\nand let out the Pokémon inside.\c\nNothing cuter than watching your Pokémon run\naround underfoot, if you ask me.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_01_ecology_08	Once you let your Pokémon out, try speaking to\nthem—they’re sure to respond in some way.\r\nIt’s a great way to get to know them better![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_01_ecology_09	However! Letting your Pokémon out of its ball\nisn’t such a great idea in some locations.\c\nCan anyone tell me where it is that you shouldn’t\nhave your Pokémon walk along with you?[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_01_select_01	Near the water
class_a_01_select_02	Inside buildings
class_a_01_select_03	In tall grass
class_a_01_ecology_answer_01	It’s certainly true that some Pokémon aren’t fond\nof water, but we do have floating platforms they\r\ncan use, so being near water isn’t an issue.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_01_ecology_answer_02	[VAR BD06(0000)]That’s right! Great job, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nI see\r\nyou\r\ndid\r\nyour\r\nhomework.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_01_ecology_answer_03	Pokémon love tall grass! I can’t see them having\nany problem walking with you there.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_01_ecology_10	The correct answer is that we should not walk\nwith our Pokémon indoors. How about that![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_01_ecology_11	Some Pokémon might damage walls, desks, and\nother things walking around inside buildings, so\r\nit’s not allowed regardless of the species.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_01_ecology_12	Therefore, please only let your Pokémon out of\ntheir Poké Balls while outdoors. OK, everyone?\c\nI think I see them out and about in classrooms\nfrom time to time, but still...[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_01_ecology_13	Anyway, you may become even closer friends\nwith your Pokémon pals by walking together![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_01_ecology_14	Oh! I almost forgot—keep in mind that you can\nonly walk together with your lead Pokémon.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_01_ecology_15	Remember—use the [VAR FF00(0006)]ZR Button[VAR FF00(0000)] to throw a ball\nand let out the Pokémon inside.\c\nYou’ll also want to remember that throwing a\nball at a wild Pokémon will start a battle![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_01_ecology_16	It looks like that’s all the time we have for today.\nSee you all next class![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_02.dat
class_a_02_ecology_01_old_00	Hello, hello. I hope everyone’s ready to learn\nsome new things today![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_02_ecology_02_old_00	Did you all try using the ZR Button to let your\nPokémon out as I taught you in our last class?[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_02_ecology_03	Walking along with your Pokémon lets you see\nhow unique and cute they all are.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_02_ecology_04	I’d also highly recommend picnics for when you\nwant to spend some quality time together with\r\nthe Pokémon in your party.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_02_ecology_05	You can get them all around the table to make\nsandwiches and play—it’s really a lot of fun![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_02_ecology_06	If you want to learn more about making food,\nMr. Saguaro’s class is the best place to go![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_02_ecology_07	Now, sometimes, while you’re enjoying a picnic\nwith your Pokémon...[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_02_ecology_08	you may find something very, VERY important in\nthe basket next to your table![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_02_ecology_09	This very important something is what Pokémon\nare born from. Let’s all say it together![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_02_select_01	Boxes!
class_a_02_select_02	Poké Balls!
class_a_02_select_03	Eggs!
class_a_02_ecology_answer_01	[VAR BD06(0000)]Huh? Um...[VAR 0100(0000)], it looks\nlike\r\nyou’re\r\nthe\r\nonly\r\none\r\nwho\r\nsaid Boxes.\c\nWe sometimes send Pokémon to Boxes for\nsafekeeping, but they’re not born from them![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_02_ecology_answer_02	[VAR BD06(0000)]Huh? Um...[VAR 0100(0000)], it looks\nlike\r\nyou’re\r\nthe\r\nonly\r\none\r\nwho\r\nsaid\r\nPoké Balls!\c\nI don’t believe there have been any Pokémon\ndiscovered yet that are born from Poké Balls![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_02_ecology_answer_03	Phew! You all got it right![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_02_ecology_10	The very important something I’m talking about\nis...a Pokémon Egg![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_02_ecology_11	It’s not clear where these Eggs come from, but\nthey’re probably placed in the basket rather\r\nstealthily by the Pokémon at the picnic.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_02_ecology_12	Walking around with an Egg will help warm it,\nwhich allows it to hatch.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_02_ecology_13	Eggs won’t warm up by sitting in Boxes, though.\nYou need to have them in your party![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_02_ecology_14	And here’s one more super important thing I’d\nlike you to remember about Eggs.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_02_ecology_15	Pokémon entrust us with their Eggs because they\nbelieve in us![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_02_ecology_16	So, I sure would be happy to see you all being\nresponsible parents for your little Pokémon Eggs![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_02_ecology_17	Whoops. My most important point came right as\nthe bell rang. Well, see you all next time, I guess![VAR 0114(002A)]

class_a_03_ecology_01	Hello, hello. I hope everyone’s ready to learn\nsome new things today![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_03_ecology_02	I seem to remember teaching you all about the\nimportance of Eggs in our last class together.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_03_ecology_03	Ah, on that note, is everyone using their\nPokédex?[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_03_ecology_04	It registers Pokémon born from Eggs as well as\nthose encountered via other methods, so don’t\r\nyou worry about that![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_03_ecology_05	And, uh, hehe...just so you know, I’m the one who\ndeveloped the Pokédex app![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_03_ecology_06	It was waaay before I started teaching here at the\nacademy, though.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_03_ecology_07	Back then, I was a researcher.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_03_ecology_08	In fact, Director Clavell wasn’t working in\neducation at the time, either!\c\nHe was researching alongside me at the\nsame facility.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_03_ecology_09	We got to research Pokémon together day in,\nday out... Those sure were fun times.\c\nI got yelled at all the time, though. Heh.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_03_ecology_10	Wait a second, how did I get onto this?\nPretty sure I was talking about the Pokédex...[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_03_ecology_11	Uh... Anyway! Today, I’d like to teach you about\ncatching Pokémon.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_03_ecology_12	As you all know, a great way to catch a Pokémon\nmore easily is to first lower its HP.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_03_ecology_13	But there’s another way to up your chances of a\nsuccessful catch. Can you guess what it is?[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_03_select_01	Give the Pokémon a Berry
class_a_03_select_02	Inflict the Pokémon with a status condition
class_a_03_select_03	Prove you’re stronger than the Pokémon
class_a_03_ecology_answer_01	Huh? Hmmm... Maybe that’s a bit of advice from\nanother region?\c\nThe common understanding here in Paldea may\nbe a little different.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_03_ecology_answer_02	[VAR BD06(0000)]Wow! That’s right, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nGreat job![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_03_ecology_answer_03	That’s a rough-and-tumble way to look at things,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]...\c\nI guess it’s true that sending out a strong\nPokémon can turn a battle in your favor, though.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_03_ecology_14	The correct technique for making Pokémon easier\nto catch is to inflict them with a status condition.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_03_ecology_15	Sleep is an especially effective status condition.\nIt makes Pokémon drastically easier to catch![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_03_ecology_16	If you have a Pokémon that can use moves that\nput opponents to sleep, like Sleep Powder or\r\nHypnosis, filling up your Pokédex will be a cinch![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_03_ecology_17	There are other ways to improve your catch rate\nas well, like using Poké Balls specifically designed\r\nto be effective against certain Pokémon.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_03_ecology_18	Eating food that gives you Catching Power works,\ntoo—or sneaking up on Pokémon from behind to\r\ncatch them by surprise when you start a battle![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_03_ecology_19	If you’re having trouble, you may want to make\nthe rounds to the Gyms to get Gym Badges.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_03_ecology_20	Earning Gym Badges will make it easier to catch\nPokémon of higher and higher levels![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_03_ecology_21	Please do come show me your Pokédexes once\nthey start to fill up![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_03_ecology_22	Another day, another enjoyable class. Oh yeah,\ndon’t forget—our next class will be a test![VAR 0114(002A)]

class_a_04_ecology_01	Hello, hello, everyone. Today is our\nmidterm exam.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_04_ecology_02	It sure feels good to fill in all those empty spaces\non the answer sheet, doesn’t it?[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_04_ecology_03	Take your time, and contemplate each\nquestion carefully.[VAR 0114(002A)]

class_a_04_question_06	—This question won’t affect your grade!—\n\nHow do you like the Pokédex? Is it easy to use?\nI’d be happy to hear your honest opinions!
class_a_04_ansewer_06a	It’s easy to use!
class_a_04_ansewer_06b	It’s all right
class_a_04_ansewer_06c	I don’t use it that much...
class_a_04_ecology_04	All right, everyone! Time’s up! I hope you all\nenjoyed tackling those questions![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_04_ecology_05	That last question was just something that I’m\npersonally curious to know.\c\nDon’t tell the director about it, OK?[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_04_ecology_06	I’ll grade these right away. I hope you’re all\nlooking forward to seeing how you did![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_05.dat
class_a_05_ecology_01	Hello, hello. I hope everyone’s ready to learn\nsome new things today![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_05_ecology_02	You all did really great on the midterm exam![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_05_ecology_03	Thanks for answering my little question at the\nend, too.\c\nI’ll be sure to keep your responses in mind.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_05_ecology_04	All right! We’re now heading into the last half\nof our classes together.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_05_ecology_05	It’s time for our knowledge to evolve and grow—\njust like our Pokémon![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_05_ecology_06	Evolution...yep. Haha! Evolution![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_05_ecology_07	Today we’re going to learn about the fascinating\nphenomenon of Pokémon Evolution![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_05_ecology_08	As your Pokémon battle and level up, they learn\nmoves and get stronger.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_05_ecology_09	And for some Pokémon, once they’ve leveled up\nenough...[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_05_ecology_10	their appearance changes, and their stats\nincrease—sometimes by a lot![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_05_ecology_11	That’s Pokémon Evolution![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_05_ecology_12	Pokémon become very strong when they evolve,\nmaking them trusty partners in battle.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_05_ecology_13	But! Some people prefer to keep their Pokémon\nin their adorable pre-evolved states.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_05_ecology_14	To do this, you just need to remember a certain\nbutton when your Pokémon begins to evolve.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_05_ecology_15	Say it with me if you already know! To cancel\nEvolution, press the...[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_05_select_01	A Button!
class_a_05_select_02	B Button!
class_a_05_select_03	C Button!
class_a_05_ecology_answer_01	[VAR BD06(0000)]Huh? Um...[VAR 0100(0000)], you may\nbe\r\nthinking\r\nof\r\nsomething else.\c\nThe A Button has more of a decisive feel to it.\nKinda like “A-OK!” don’t you think?[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_05_ecology_answer_02	That’s right, everyone! “B” for “best answer!”[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_05_ecology_answer_03	[VAR BD06(0000)]Huh? Um...[VAR 0100(0000)], you may\nbe\r\nthinking\r\nof\r\nsomething else.\c\nThe C Button... That has a bit of a nostalgic feel\nto it, don’t you think?[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_05_ecology_16	The button you want when you need to stop a\nPokémon from evolving is the B Button![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_05_ecology_17	If you press this button soon after a Pokémon\nbegins to evolve, you can stop it from changing.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_05_ecology_18	You can also let the Pokémon hold an item known\nas an Everstone to keep it from evolving.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_05_ecology_19	And keep in mind that the requirements for\nEvolution differ from Pokémon to Pokémon.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_05_ecology_20	Some may evolve by having a certain item, such\nas a Fire Stone or Thunder Stone, used on them.\c\nOthers may have to learn a specific move or\ndefeat a specific Pokémon in battle to evolve.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_05_ecology_21	The way Primeape evolves into Annihilape is\nespecially strange.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_05_ecology_22	You see, there’s a certain move that—[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_05_ecology_23	Whoops. Sorry, looks like we’re out of time![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_05_ecology_24	I guess we’ll have to end the class there today.\nThank you all for your attention![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_06.dat
class_a_06_ecology_01	Hello, hello. I hope everyone’s ready to learn\nsome new things today![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_06_ecology_02	But before we get going, do you all remember\nthe final question from our midterm exam?[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_06_ecology_03	Well, Director Clavell found out about it\nsomehow, and I got yelled at. Whoops.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_06_ecology_04	Apparently he could tell I was hiding something\njust by looking at me.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_06_ecology_05	He must’ve noticed all the color flush right out of\nmy face! Haha![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_06_ecology_06	Speaking of color, today I’d like to teach you\nall about colors as they pertain to Pokémon![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_06_ecology_07	Some Pokémon have slightly different coloration\nor patterning on their bodies based on their\r\ngender or individual differences.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_06_ecology_08	In very rare cases, a Pokémon may have wildly\ndifferent coloration compared to others of the\r\nsame species.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_06_ecology_09	We call these specimens [VAR FF00(0006)]Shiny [VAR FF00(0000)]Pokémon.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_06_ecology_10	It is quite rare to cross paths with one.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_06_ecology_11	Does anyone here know what the likelihood of\nfinding a Shiny Pokémon is?[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_06_select_01	1 in 40
class_a_06_select_02	1 in 400
class_a_06_select_03	1 in 4,000
class_a_06_ecology_answer_01	It would be nice if they were that common! We\nwould be able to do far more research on them.\r\nBut they’re actually quite a bit more rare.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_06_ecology_answer_02	That’s not a bad guess. But they’re actually\neven rarer than 1 in 400![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_06_ecology_answer_03	Wow! That’s right! You may have the makings of a\nPokémon Professor, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_06_ecology_12	Shiny Pokémon appear at a rate of 1 in 4,000.\nIsn’t that amazing?[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_06_ecology_13	The probability of encountering one in the wild is\nthe same as hatching one from an Egg, too![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_06_ecology_14	Eggs from a pair of Pokémon raised around\ndiffering languages are a special case.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_06_ecology_15	There is a higher than average chance that\na Shiny Pokémon will hatch from these Eggs.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_06_ecology_16	But we haven’t been able to figure out why that is\njust yet.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_06_ecology_17	I’ve also heard rumors of a charm that increases\nyour likelihood of finding Shiny Pokémon when\r\nyou have it in your Bag—can you believe that?![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_06_ecology_18	This claim can’t be scientifically verified, but it\nsure would be fun if it were true.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_06_ecology_19	Whoops...there’s the bell.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_06_ecology_20	That’s all for today. Thank you for your attention![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_07.dat
class_a_07_ecology_01	Hello, hello. I hope everyone’s ready to learn\nsome new things today![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_07_ecology_02	Next time we meet, we’ll have our final exam.\nThat means today is our last actual class.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_07_ecology_03	And the topic for this last class will be...Pokémon\n[VAR FF00(0006)]forms[VAR FF00(0000)]! You can just think of forms as the shapes\r\nor appearances that Pokémon have.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_07_ecology_04	There’s also a phenomenon called a [VAR FF00(0006)]form[VAR FF00(0000)]\n[VAR FF00(0006)]change[VAR FF00(0000)], where a Pokémon’s appearance\r\nchanges under certain conditions.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_07_ecology_05	Cyclizar, for example, which we regularly ride on\nas transportation here in Paldea, has three forms.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_07_ecology_06	First is its basic form, where it walks on four\nlegs. Second is its battle form, where it stands\r\non its hind legs to engage in battle.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_07_ecology_07	Finally, there’s its ride form, where it inflates its\nthroat sac and its tail so we can ride on its back.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_07_ecology_08	Though we can use something you’re all carrying\nwith you now as an even better example![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_07_ecology_09	Yup, I’m talking about your phones! Some\nsmartphones are inhabited by a certain Pokémon.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_07_ecology_10	Does anyone know the Pokémon I’m referring to?[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_07_select_01	Rotom
class_a_07_select_02	Pikachu
class_a_07_select_03	Heracross
class_a_07_ecology_answer_01	You’re a regular expert on Pokémon AND\ntechnology, aren’t you, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_07_ecology_answer_02	It sure would be adorable if it were Pikachu in\nour phones—and it would probably make us want\r\nto walk around more, too!\c\nBut too bad, that’s not the right answer![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_07_ecology_answer_03	[VAR BD06(0000)]Haha! I see where you’re coming from,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nHeracross can learn a move called Smart Strike!\nSmartphone, Smart Strike... Well, unfortunately,\r\nthere’s no connection![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_07_ecology_11	The Pokémon inside your smartphone is Rotom,\nand it does all sorts of things to help you out.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_07_ecology_12	A Rotom inside a Rotom Phone is special, so it\ndoesn’t try to enter other electronics.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_07_ecology_13	An ordinary Rotom, however, can change form by\nentering washing machines, microwave ovens,\r\nand other electronic appliances.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_07_ecology_14	Rotom is a bit of an exception, though. Many\nPokémon that change form do so simply by\r\nholding an item or by having one used on them.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_07_ecology_15	Oricorio, for example, has four different forms it\ncan change between when given certain nectars.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_07_ecology_16	Pokémon may even change type or learn\ndifferent moves when they change form.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_07_ecology_17	Form changes are different from Evolution in that\nthe Pokémon can return to its original form.\c\nAnd unlike Shiny Pokémon, which can’t change\ntheir special coloration, the same individual\r\nPokémon can go back and forth between\r\nits forms.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_07_ecology_18	There’s a lot to dig into with this form change\nphenomenon, as you can see![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_07_ecology_19	We can all learn something from Pokémon\nhere, don’t you think? Bit of a stretch, but...[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_07_ecology_20	I’d be happy to see you all enjoy your time at\nthe academy to the fullest...and change form\r\ninto a new version of yourselves![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_07_ecology_21	Or something like that, anyway![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_07_ecology_22	Oh! I almost forgot![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_07_ecology_23	Regional forms, which vary based on what region\na Pokémon came from, don’t change like other\r\nforms. They’re an innate—[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_07_ecology_24	Whoops. Heh...there’s the bell.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_07_ecology_25	I guess I was scatterbrained Mr. Jacq right up to\nthe very end, huh?\c\nI had a great time teaching all of you. I hope\nyou’ll do your best on the final exam![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_08.dat
class_a_08_ecology_01	Hello hello, everyone. Today is our final exam.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_08_ecology_02	It will cover everything I’ve taught you so far! But\nI’m sure you all will do just fine.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_08_ecology_03	Take your time, and contemplate each question\ncarefully.[VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_08_question_01	1. How many of the following four methods\n    make it easier to catch a Pokémon?\n\n    ・Inflicting paralysis   ・Using a Poké Toy\n    ・Feeding it a Berry   ・Surprising it from behind
class_a_08_ansewer_01a	One
class_a_08_ansewer_01b	Two
class_a_08_ansewer_01c	Three
class_a_08_ansewer_01d	Four
class_a_08_question_02	2. True or false? You can get new Pokémon\n    only by catching them yourself or trading\n    with other Trainers.
class_a_08_ansewer_02a	True
class_a_08_ansewer_02b	False
class_a_08_question_03	3. If a Pokémon is holding an Everstone, will\n    using an item that induces Evolution, such as\n    a Fire Stone, cause it to evolve?\n\nA) Yes, it will\nB) No, it won’t
class_a_08_ansewer_03a	A) Yes, it will
class_a_08_ansewer_03b	B) No, it won’t
class_a_08_question_04	4. What is the probability of running into a\n    Shiny Pokémon?\n\nA) 1 in 2,000\nB) 1 in 4,000\nC) 1 in 6,000
class_a_08_ansewer_04a	A) 1 in 2,000
class_a_08_ansewer_04b	B) 1 in 4,000
class_a_08_ansewer_04c	C) 1 in 6,000
class_a_08_question_05	5. True or false? The Pokémon known as Oricorio\n    has three forms.
class_a_08_ansewer_05a	True
class_a_08_ansewer_05b	False
class_a_08_question_06	—This question won’t affect your grade!—\n\nDo you have anything you would like to say\nabout my class? I’m still getting used to this\nteaching thing, but I sure had fun as your teacher!
class_a_08_ansewer_06a	It was fun!
class_a_08_ansewer_06b	Thank you for being our teacher!
class_a_08_ansewer_06c	Keep teaching! You can do it!
class_a_08_ecology_04	OK! Time’s up whether you like it or not! I hope\neveryone enjoyed tackling those questions![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_08_ecology_05	Hehe... I snuck in a little bonus question there\nright at the end again. Shhh, our little secret—\r\ndon’t tell the director![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_a_08_ecology_06	I’ll grade these right away. I hope you’re all\nlooking forward to seeing how you did![VAR 0114(002A)]
class_b_01.dat
class_b_01_math_01	Hello, everyone. Nice to meet you. My name’s\nTyme, and I will be your math teacher.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_01_math_02	Sorry to put you all on the spot at the start of\nclass, but let me ask you a quick question—\r\nDo you enjoy numbers, arithmetic, and the like?[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_01_popup_01	Yeah!
class_b_01_popup_02	Sort of.
class_b_01_popup_03	Errr...
class_b_01_math_03	Oh, my. Hahaha. Thank you for your honest\nresponses.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_01_math_04	Some of you may like numbers, and some may\nnot. I think that makes a wonderful mix.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_01_math_05	But no matter your opinion on math, I hope you\nfind yourselves enjoying our lessons together!\c\nI’ll do my best to find a good way to match up\nyour interests with all types of math lessons![VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_01_math_06	Speaking of which, are you all caught up on your\nstudies of Pokémon type matchups?[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_01_math_07	For example, Grass is strong against Water, and\nWater is strong against Fire, correct?[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_01_math_08	[VAR BD06(0000)][VAR 0100(0000)], you seem to\nbe\r\ngood\r\nwith\r\nPokémon,\r\nso\r\nlet\r\nme\r\nask\r\nyou this...[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_01_math_09	Bearing in mind that Water is strong against Fire...\nIf the move Water Gun hits a Fire-type Pokémon,\r\nwhat becomes of the move’s damage?[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_01_select_01	It’s cut in half
class_b_01_select_02	It doesn’t change
class_b_01_select_03	It’s doubled
class_b_01_math_answer_01	Oh, my. A little reverse thinking, I see! But I’d\nprobably be in rough shape afterward if I got hit\r\nby something I was weak to. Wouldn’t you be?[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_01_math_answer_02	A real hardy individual, I see! But I’d probably\nbe in rough shape afterward if I got hit by\r\nsomething I was weak to. Wouldn’t you be?[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_01_math_answer_03	That’s right! I knew I could count on you for this\nquestion, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_01_math_10	Using moves of a type that your opponent is\nweak to is a supereffective tactic!\c\nIt multiplies the damage of those moves by two![VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_01_math_11	On the other hand, using moves of a type that\nyour opponent is resistant to isn’t very effective.\r\nIt divides the damage of your moves by two.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_01_math_12	Haha! I don’t mean to encroach on Ms. Dendra’s\nbattle studies territory, of course, but I thought\r\nit best to use a lively topic as an example.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_01_math_13	That can make math fun even for those of you\nwho don’t much like the subject, don’t you think?[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_01_math_14	Oh, my. Is that the bell? I suppose that’s all for\nnow. What a shame...[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_01_math_15	I’m looking forward to seeing you all in the next\nclass. I hope you’re looking forward to it, too![VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_02.dat
class_b_02_math_01	Hello, everyone. Let’s have a fun class today.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_02_math_02	Tell me, do you all enjoy shopping?[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_02_math_03	Buying tasty bread or choosing new clothes—\neven just window shopping is so much fun![VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_02_math_04	In today’s class, I’d like to use shopping—one of\nmy own favorite hobbies, mind you—to teach\r\nyou all about math![VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_02_math_05	I’m sure everyone here has visited a Poké Mart at\nleast once. They sell all sorts of Pokémon items![VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_02_math_06	Poké Balls are one of the many useful items you\ncan find there. They cost 200 each.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_02_math_07	Now then, I’d like you all to do some thinking\nwith me here![VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_02_math_08	One Poké Ball is 200. If you had 2,000 and\nbought as many Poké Balls as you could afford,\r\nhow many would you receive?[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_02_select_01	Nine
class_b_02_select_02	Ten
class_b_02_select_03	Eleven
class_b_02_math_answer_01	[VAR BD06(0000)]Oh, my. That guess falls a little short,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_02_math_answer_02	[VAR BD06(0000)]Oh dear. I’m sorry, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nI suppose\r\nthis\r\nwas\r\na bit\r\nof a\r\ntrick question.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_02_math_answer_03	[VAR BD06(0000)]That’s correct! Well done,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_02_math_09	With 2,000, you can afford to purchase a\nmaximum of 10 Poké Balls...[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_02_math_10	However! If you purchase 10 or more of any one\ntype of Poké Ball...[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_02_math_11	You will also receive one Premier Ball—a special\nwhite ball—as a bonus![VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_02_math_12	So the correct answer is, in fact, 11![VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_02_math_13	It sure is nice to get a little bonus like that on a\nshopping trip, isn’t it?[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_02_math_14	Oh, my. Is that the bell? I suppose that’s all for\nnow. What a shame...[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_02_math_15	I’m looking forward to seeing you all in the next\nclass. I hope you’re looking forward to it, too![VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_03.dat
class_b_03_math_01	Hello, everyone. Let’s have a fun class today.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_03_math_02	Tell me, do you all enjoy fortune telling,\nhoroscopes, and the like?[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_03_math_03	I think it feels great to read your horoscope and\nsee that it says good luck is coming your way.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_03_math_04	So today, I’d like to teach you all math while\nfocusing on the topic of luck![VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_03_math_05	Perhaps you have seen the following phrase\ncrop up during Pokémon battles before...\c\n“A critical hit!”[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_03_math_06	When a Pokémon’s attack lands as a critical hit,\nthe damage it deals is increased by half.\c\nIn other words, it does one-and-a-half times as\nmuch damage as it normally would![VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_03_math_07	It is truly luck that determines whether your\nPokémon lands a critical hit—or has one landed\r\non it. This can cause a great upset in battle.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_03_math_08	Does anyone know what percent chance a\nPokémon has of landing a critical hit?[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_03_select_01	About 1 percent (1 in 100 hits)
class_b_03_select_02	About 4 percent (4 in 100 hits)
class_b_03_select_03	About 12 percent (12 in 100 hits)
class_b_03_math_answer_01	Oh, my. Critical hits land a little more often than\nthat, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_03_math_answer_02	[VAR BD06(0000)]That is correct! Well done,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_03_math_answer_03	Oh, my. That might cause a bit TOO critical of a\nsituation, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_03_math_09	The chance of landing a critical hit is said to be\n1 in 24...which figures to roughly 4.17 percent.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_03_math_10	The odds are more favorable for certain moves,\nthough—why, moves such as Stone Edge and\r\nShadow Claw have about a 12 percent chance![VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_03_math_11	You can also use a move called Focus Energy or\nan item known as a Dire Hit.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_03_math_12	Both raise the critical-hit ratio by two stages—\nthat’s a 50 percent chance to land a critical hit![VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_03_math_13	It feels great to land a critical hit, but perhaps\nnot so great to be struck by one![VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_03_math_14	There is a surprising amount of mathematical\nprobability hidden in Pokémon battles, you know.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_03_math_15	If you’re able to do the calculations that’ll swing\nluck in your favor, it may open the door for more\r\nstrategic choices for you during battle.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_03_math_16	Oh, my. Is that the bell? I suppose that’s all for\nnow. What a shame...[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_03_math_17	Next class will be our fun midterm exam! I hope\nyou’ll all be looking forward to it.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_04.dat
class_b_04_math_01	All right, everyone. It’s time to begin our\nmidterm exam.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_04_math_02	I’m sure the fun experiences you all had in my\nclass will serve you well as you answer![VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_04_question_01	1. How much damage does Water Gun do when\n    it hits a Fire-type Pokémon?\n\nA) Half damage\nB) Normal damage\nC) Double damage
class_b_04_ansewer_01a	A) Half damage

class_b_04_question_04	4. What percent chance does a Pokémon usually\n    have to land a critical hit?\n\nA) About 1 percent\nB) About 4 percent\nC) About 12 percent
class_b_04_ansewer_04a	A) About 1 percent
class_b_04_ansewer_04b	B) About 4 percent

class_b_04_ansewer_05b	B) One-and-a-half times as much

class_b_04_math_03	All right, everyone. Time is up! Put your hands\non your laps, now.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_04_math_04	You were all concentrating so hard. I can’t wait to\nsee how you did.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_04_math_05	Do go and ask for your scores at the front desk\nand then take a nice break.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_05.dat
class_b_05_math_01	Hello, everyone. Well done on the midterm exam.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_05_math_02	Some of you earned perfect scores, and others\nseemed to have a bit of trouble, but I can tell\r\nthat you all tried your best.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_05_math_03	I am quite pleased to say that every last one of\nyou passed.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_05_math_04	I can only assume that this means you have all\ncome to love numbers![VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_05_math_05	Stay sharp, and try your best for the rest of my\nclasses, too![VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_05_math_06	Speaking of staying “sharp,” do you know how\nthat word applies to Pokémon battles?\r\nThat’s right—it has to do with stat boosts![VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_05_math_07	A Pokémon’s stats can rise and fall throughout\nthe course of battle, correct?[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_05_math_08	For example, if a Pokémon uses the move\nWork Up, its Attack and Sp. Atk stats will rise by\r\none stage each.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_05_math_09	And, as you may know, each time a Pokémon’s\nAttack or Sp. Atk rises one stage, moves affected\r\nby that stat will deal 50 percent more damage.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_05_math_10	If that same Pokémon from our previous example\nwere to use Work Up again, both its Attack and\r\nSp. Atk will have risen by two stages total.\c\nThis results in a 100 percent increase to damage\ndealt, making its moves twice as strong![VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_05_math_11	Swords Dance, on the other hand, boosts Attack\nby two stages at once, allowing the Pokémon to\r\ndeal double damage after just a single use![VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_05_math_12	Using Swords Dance twice would boost the\nPokémon’s Attack stat by four stages. How much\r\nmore damage, then, would this Pokémon deal?[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_05_select_01	Double damage
class_b_05_select_02	Triple damage
class_b_05_select_03	Quadruple damage
class_b_05_math_answer_01	Ah, yes. This question is a tricky one, isn’t it?\c\nDamage would be doubled if it’d used Work Up\ntwice, but we’re talking about Swords Dance.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_05_math_answer_02	Wow, that’s great! You answered this difficult\nquestion with ease, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_05_math_answer_03	Ah, yes. This question is a tricky one, isn’t it?\c\nJust because it boosts the Pokémon’s stat by four\nstages doesn’t mean damage is quadrupled.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_05_math_13	Each stage that a Pokémon’s Attack or Sp. Atk\nstat is raised increases its damage by 50 percent.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_05_math_14	So, being raised four stages would result in a four\ntimes 50 percent—or 200 percent—increase.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_05_math_15	The base damage of a move is 100 percent, so\nadding 200 percent to that gives us 300 percent.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_05_math_16	In other words, the next move the Pokémon uses\nwill deal triple damage.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_05_math_17	Type matchups, critical-hit damage, and other\nfactors all play into these calculations as well,\r\nso even a small boost must be taken seriously.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_05_math_18	By the way, if a stat simply “rose,” that means it\nhas gone up by one stage.\c\nIf it “rose sharply,” that’s two stages.\c\nAnd if it “rose drastically,” that’s three stages.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_05_math_19	Just so you know, the X Attack and X Sp. Atk\nitems, which can only be used in battle, can be\r\nused to sharply boost those respective stats.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_05_math_20	Oh, my. Is that the bell? I suppose that’s all for\nnow. What a shame...[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_05_math_21	Today’s lesson was a little difficult, so be sure to\nreview what you learned in order to stay “sharp”!\r\nI’ll see you all again next class.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_06.dat
class_b_06_math_01	Hello, everyone. Let’s have a fun class today.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_06_math_02	Did you make sure to review last class’s material\nin order to stay “sharp”?[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_06_math_03	I know it was a little difficult with all that talk of\nmultiplication and percentages and the like.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_06_math_04	But today, we’ll be talking about percentages\nagain to learn about probability.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_06_math_05	That may sound like we’re going to have another\ndifficult class, but did you know that all of you\r\nalready deal with probability on a regular basis?[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_06_math_06	Pokémon moves generally have a property called\naccuracy, which determines the probability that\r\nthey will hit.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_06_math_07	The accuracy of Tackle is 100—or 100 percent.\nSo if you were to use Tackle 100 times, you\r\ncould expect it to hit all 100 times![VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_06_math_08	The move Hypnosis, which puts opponents to\nsleep, has an accuracy of 60—or 60 percent.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_06_math_09	That means you could expect it to hit 60 times\nin 100 uses. To put that another way—out of 100\r\nuses, you could expect it to miss 40 times![VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_06_math_10	Many of the truly powerful moves often tend to\nhave lower accuracy.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_06_math_11	So when you’re deciding whether to go slow and\nsteady with moves that are sure to hit, or hard\r\nand fast with stronger but less accurate moves...[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_06_math_12	you’re already studying probability![VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_06_math_13	Let me see here... Perhaps Surf and Hydro Pump\nwould be good examples for this discussion?[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_06_math_14	Surf has a power of 90. Its accuracy is 100,\nmeaning you can expect it to hit every time.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_06_math_15	Hydro Pump’s accuracy is only 80—but when it\nhits, its power is 110![VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_06_math_16	So, between Surf and Hydro Pump, which move\nwould you want to use yourselves?[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_06_select_01	I’d use Surf
class_b_06_select_02	I’d use Hydro Pump
class_b_06_select_03	It depends on the situation
class_b_06_math_answer_01	Oh my. I see it’s “slow and steady wins the race”\nfor you, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_06_math_answer_02	Oh my. I see you like the risky, adventurous side\nof things, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_06_math_answer_03	Oh my. I see you’re always considering various\npossibilities, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_06_math_17	I may have made it sound like there was a correct\nanswer here, but there’s not!\c\nYou’re free to use any moves you wish![VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_06_math_18	Factors like PP or number of targets hit may make\nsome moves more suited to certain situations.\c\nHowever, trading accuracy for power or vice\nversa is purely a matter of preference![VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_06_math_19	This Surf-versus-Hydro Pump debate has been\nongoing for quite some time.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_06_math_20	Personally, I’m more invested in debating the\nRock-type moves Rock Slide and Stone Edge.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_06_math_21	Let me tell you, I could get really worked up\ntalking about those moves, but—\c\nOh, my. There’s the bell. What a shame.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_06_math_22	Next class will be the last of our time together,\nso show up 100 percent ready to go![VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_07.dat
class_b_07_math_01	Hello, everyone. I hope we can have fun once\nagain today for our last class together.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_07_math_02	Last time we learned about probability, using\nmove accuracy as an example.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_07_math_03	Probability is quite an interesting subject. Did\nyou know that, in a class with 40 students, there\r\nis a 90 percent chance that two of them will have\r\nthe same birthday?[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_07_math_04	This is true even despite the fact that there are\nover 300 days each year. Isn’t that remarkable?[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_07_math_05	But let’s move on to today’s topic before we\nget swept along with probability again.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_07_math_06	I’ve been teaching you all how to calculate\ndamage in this class using examples like type\r\nmatchups, critical hits, stat boosts, and the like.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_07_math_07	All of these variables are multiplied together to\ncalculate damage dealt to an opponent.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_07_math_08	However, did you know that there is an even\nsimpler way to increase the damage of your\r\nPokémon’s moves?[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_07_math_09	All you have to do is have your Pokémon use\na move it shares a type with![VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_07_math_10	If a Rock-type Pokémon uses the Rock-type move\nStone Edge, the move’s base power of 100 is\r\nmultiplied by 1.5 to become 150.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_07_math_11	Ground and Rock may seem like similar types,\nbut if a Ground-type Pokémon uses Stone Edge,\r\nthe move’s power will remain 100.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_07_math_12	Supereffective moves and critical hits also add\nmultipliers on to this little numerical increase,\r\nso it most certainly must not be taken lightly.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_07_math_13	Let me ask you a question to see if you\nunderstand what I’m talking about here.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_07_math_14	Say you have a move with a power of 100. If a\nPokémon that shares a type with this move\r\nuses it and hits an opponent that is weak to\r\nthat type, what happens to that move’s power?[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_07_select_01	Its power becomes 150
class_b_07_select_02	Its power becomes 200
class_b_07_select_03	Its power becomes 300
class_b_07_math_answer_01	Close! But a power of 150 would only take into\naccount the multiplier of 1.5 resulting from the\r\nPokémon sharing a type with the move.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_07_math_answer_02	Close! But a power of 200 would only take into\naccount the doubling effect of using a move\r\nthat is super effective against an opponent.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_07_math_answer_03	You did that calculation all in your head? Well\ndone, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_07_math_15	First, using a move that shares a type with its user\nmultiplies the move’s base power of 100 by 1.5,\r\nmaking the power 150![VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_07_math_16	The fact that the opponent is weak to the move’s\ntype then doubles that power from 150 to 300![VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_07_math_17	The original power of the move ends up being\ntripled! Isn’t that amazing?[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_07_math_18	What’s more, if a Pokémon Terastallizes and its\nTera Type matches one of its original types, then\r\nthe bonus it gets for using a move of that same\r\ntype increases from 1.5 to 2![VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_07_math_19	Of course, being able to use a lot of moves with\ndifferent types is great as well. That’s one way\r\nyou can surprise your opponent.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_07_math_20	In the end, your own innate characteristics are\nwhat will really let you shine the most.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_07_math_21	Bear in mind that this is true for both humans and\nPokémon.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_07_math_22	It sure would make me happy if you could take\nthose words to heart![VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_07_math_23	But I suppose I should really have shared this\nbasic advice right from our first lesson.\c\nMy apologies...[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_07_math_24	And just like that, class is over. The last of our\ntime together flew by in the blink of an eye.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_07_math_25	It was so much fun to be able to teach all you\neager students about numbers.[VAR 0114(0025)]
class_b_07_math_26	Next class will be our fun final exam! Be sure to\nreview the material well in preparation.[VAR 0114(0025)]

class_c_02_history_03	About two thousand years ago, this region came\nunder the rule of the Paldean Empire.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_02_history_04	Historical accounts describe the Paldean emperor\nas being quite the dictator.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_02_history_05	This emperor also zealously believed the legend\nof the treasure that rests deep within Area Zero.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_02_history_06	I must mention that the civilizations of our\nancestors were not as developed as ours is today.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_02_history_07	People back then were far more likely to believe\nin mysterious legends, magic, and beings beyond\r\nhuman comprehension.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_02_history_08	In an attempt to gain the power to stand against\nPaldea’s neighboring countries, the emperor\r\nsent people in droves to join the hunt for the\r\nfabled treasure of Area Zero.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_02_history_09	Aha. Perfect timing to make eye contact, young\n[VAR 0100(0000)]. Answer me this...[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_02_history_10	Approximately how many years ago was it that\nthe Paldean Empire began to rule this region?[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_02_select_01	About one thousand years ago

class_c_02_history_11	The answer is about two thousand years ago.\nThat is when the Great Era of Exploration began.[VAR 0114(0027)]

class_c_04_history_04	That last question was a freebie. Even the least\ncapable of you surely padded your score there.\r\nI sincerely hope you did, anyway.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_04_history_05	So ends our midterm examination. You may ask\nfor your scores at the school’s front desk.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_05.dat
class_c_05_history_01	Greetings, my little students. Whatever you did\nyesterday, it is now a part of history.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_05_history_02	I was hoping to continue unraveling the marvels\nthat history has presented to us today.\c\nHowever, I imagine your ability to concentrate\nhas been spectacularly derailed by my midterm.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_05_history_03	I suppose changing things up for fun and variety\nmay be a good idea every now and then.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_05_history_04	So allow me to tell you an old fairy tale that has\nbeen passed down in Paldea for generations.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_05_history_05	Once upon a time, there was a king who very\nmuch enjoyed collecting treasure.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_05_history_06	He was particularly fond of treasures from\nother countries.\c\nOne day, a merchant from the East heard rumors\nof this king and came to meet him.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_05_history_07	The merchant laid out four treasures in front of\nthe treasure-loving king.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_05_history_08	The four treasures were as follows: a vessel, a\nsword, a set of tablets, and a set of beads.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_05_history_09	Seeing such rarities before him, the king leaped\nfor joy.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_05_history_10	He showered the merchant with gold coins and\nclaimed all four of the treasures for himself.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_05_history_11	Aha. Perfect timing to make eye contact, young\n[VAR 0100(0000)]. Answer me this...[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_05_history_12	I said that one of the treasures was a “set of\ntablets.” What do you think these tablets were?[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_05_select_01	Wooden planks for writing on
class_c_05_select_02	Handheld electronic devices
class_c_05_select_03	Medicine that you chew
class_c_05_history_answer_01	Correct! Your daily pursuit of knowledge serves\nyou well.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_05_history_answer_02	Incorrect! Is that some kind of joke? Were you\nexpecting me to laugh at your assumption that\r\nelectronic tablets existed in the distant past?[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_05_history_answer_03	Incorrect! Is that some kind of joke? Were you\nexpecting me to laugh at the notion that\r\nchewable tablets would be considered treasure?[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_05_history_13	These particular tablets were wooden and used\nas a writing medium in the East in ancient times.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_05_history_14	As you may know, they fell out of popular use\nas paper become more universally available.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_05_history_15	For the king to consider these paper substitutes\ntreasures, they must have been of superb quality.\c\nThat, or perhaps they had some amazingly\nprofound teachings written on them.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_05_history_16	So, the king obtained these four treasures, and\non that very night...[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_05_history_17	it is said that a terrible disaster rained down upon\nhis castle, reducing it to rubble by dawn.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_05_history_18	Oho, is that the time already? I wasn’t done with\nmy story, but alas. So ends today’s lesson.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_05_history_19	If you are interested in how the story ends,\nyou may come see me outside class hours.[VAR 0114(0027)]

class_c_06_history_01	Greetings, my little students. Whatever you did\nyesterday, it is now a part of history.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_06_history_02	Today, we will continue to unravel the marvels\nthat history has presented to us.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_06_history_03	I trust that you all remember our lesson before\nthe midterm exam concerning the Great Crater\r\nof Paldea and its interior—Area Zero.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_06_history_04	This mysterious crater captured the imaginations\nof many—including the former Paldean emperor.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_06_history_05	Two hundred years ago, a group of explorers\nclaimed to have finally reached its depths.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_06_history_06	The name of the team that achieved this great\nfeat was the Area Zero Expedition.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_06_history_07	The team is said to have been made up of\nPaldea’s best and brightest.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_06_history_08	Skilled battlers, brilliant researchers—talented\nindividuals of all kinds.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_06_history_09	Among the list of team members was the name\nof a man who was an author and brilliant natural\r\nhistorian: [VAR FF00(0006)]Heath[VAR FF00(0000)].[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_06_history_10	After returning from the expedition to Area Zero,\nhe used his literary talent to record the events of\r\nthe expedition and publish them.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_06_history_11	Aha. Perfect timing to make eye contact, young\n[VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_06_history_12	Let’s see if you were paying attention.\c\nWhat was the name of the team that first made it\nto the deepest reaches of the Great Crater?[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_06_select_01	The Area Zero Adventurers
class_c_06_select_02	The Area Zero Expedition
class_c_06_select_03	The Area Zero Survey Corps
class_c_06_history_answer_01	Incorrect! I see that even your little head has\nbecome full of dreams of adventure.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_06_history_answer_02	Correct! To pick up on and remember a term I\nsimply slipped into the flow of the lecture...\r\nYou really are quite the clever one.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_06_history_answer_03	Incorrect! Though I will admit that an expedition\nand a survey corps may take part in very\r\nsimilar activities![VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_06_history_13	The correct name for this team was the Area\nZero Expedition![VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_06_history_14	The record of their activities written by the\nexpedition member Heath can be found in\r\nbookstores and the like even today.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_06_history_15a	This record is now known as the[VAR FF00(0006)] Scarlet Book[VAR FF00(0000)].[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_06_history_15b	This record is now known as the[VAR FF00(0006)] Violet Book[VAR FF00(0000)].[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_06_history_16	At the time, the entire region of Paldea was\nabsolutely buzzing about Area Zero.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_06_history_17a	The Scarlet Book was so popular that practically\neveryone had a copy.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_06_history_17b	The Violet Book was so popular that practically\neveryone had a copy.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_06_history_18	However, the book itself was full of fantastical\ndescriptions and illustrations of things that could\r\nnever be thought of as real.\c\nThe masses began to call Heath a liar.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_06_history_19	Even the truth of the expedition making it to the\nbottom of the crater was called into question.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_06_history_20a	The Scarlet Book was condemned to the shelves\nof used bookstores as just another book of wild\r\nparanormal stories.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_06_history_20b	The Violet Book was condemned to the shelves\nof used bookstores as just another book of wild\r\nparanormal stories.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_06_history_21	There’s a copy on one of the bookshelves on the\nground floor of the entrance hall.\c\nFeel free to have a read if you’re interested.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_06_history_22	Oho, is that the time already? I must’ve gotten\nswept up in filling your minds with knowledge.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_06_history_23	This ends today’s lesson. We will unravel more of\nhistory’s enigmas together next time.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_07.dat
class_c_07_history_01	Greetings, my little students. Whatever you did\nyesterday, it is now a part of history.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_07_history_02	Today is our last class, so I would like to unravel\nthe marvels that history has presented to us\r\none last time.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_07_history_03	In our last class, I taught you about the Area Zero\nExpedition of two hundred years ago, correct?[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_07_history_04	Alas, two hundred years is not that long ago.\nNot that long ago at all.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_07_history_05	How unfortunate that our history lessons must\nmarch so inexorably toward the future.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_07_history_06	Would it not be more of an adventure to march\ntoward the past instead?\c\nTo start from our present and study history\nin reverse?![VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_07_select_a	I think it would!
class_c_07_select_b	That might be hard to follow...
class_c_07_history_07a	[VAR BD06(0000)]So you agree with me, do you,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]?\c\nHowever, I’m afraid I risk incurring the wrath of\nour dear director if I stray from the curriculum.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_07_history_07b	Indeed. It may be difficult to understand the\nflow of events—how one thing leads to another—\r\nif we were to trace history in reverse.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_07_history_08	*sigh* I suppose I have no choice but to let the\nflow of time carry us toward the future.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_07_history_09	In this last class of ours, I shall fill your minds with\nthe history of the Terastal phenomenon.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_07_history_10	The technology behind Tera Orbs has its origins\nin Area Zero.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_07_history_11	Even after the Area Zero Expedition supposedly\nreached the crater’s deepest depths, others\r\ncontinued to explore that area...[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_07_history_12	And, around 140 years ago, Pokémon cloaked\nin a mysterious light were discovered there.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_07_history_13	As you may have already guessed, these were, in\nfact, Terastallized Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_07_history_14	However, when those who discovered these\nPokémon brought them out of Area Zero, the\r\nlight faded, and the Terastal phenomenon\r\nremained a mystery for quite some time.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_07_history_15	However, 10 years ago—ugh, that might as well\nbe present day—a certain someone you have\r\ndefinitely heard of unraveled this mystery.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_07_history_16	Aha. Perfect timing to make eye contact, young\n[VAR 0100(0000)]. Answer me this...[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_07_history_17	What is the name of the famous professor who\nunraveled the Terastal phenomenon mystery?[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_07_select_01	Professor Heath
class_c_07_select_02a	Professor Sada
class_c_07_select_02b	Professor Turo
class_c_07_select_03	Professor Clavell
class_c_07_history_answer_01	Incorrect! Heath is the one who wrote the record\nof the Area Zero Expedition’s activities. You must\r\nbe remembering our last class together.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_07_history_answer_02	Correct! To think that you—a new transfer to our\nacademy—could correctly answer this question...\r\nYou must be very diligent in your studies.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_07_history_answer_03	Incorrect! Or, no...perhaps you are correct, in a\nroundabout sort of way...[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_07_history_18a	Approximately 10 years ago, a professor\nnamed Sada unraveled the mystery of the\r\nTerastal phenomenon.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_07_history_18b	Approximately 10 years ago, a professor\nnamed Turo unraveled the mystery of the\r\nTerastal phenomenon.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_07_history_19a	She discovered that the shining crystals down in\nArea Zero—or rather, the energy they emit—is\r\nwhat causes Pokémon to Terastallize.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_07_history_19b	He discovered that the shining crystals down in\nArea Zero—or rather, the energy they emit—is\r\nwhat causes Pokémon to Terastallize.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_07_history_20	This led the professor to invent Tera Orb\ntechnology and to develop a practical use for it.\c\nThis technology was then shared with both the\nPokémon League and our academy.[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_07_history_21	Rumor has it that Director Clavell was one of the\nresearchers on the professor’s team...[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_07_history_22	Alas. This story is much less exciting now that\nsomeone we all know appears in it.\c\nModern history truly is dull, isn’t it?[VAR 0114(0027)]
class_c_07_history_23	Thus ends my history classes. Our next session\nwill be our final exam.\c\nBring the wonders of history to the forefront of\nyour minds in preparation.[VAR 0114(0027)]

class_e_01_battle_05	We’ll start with the basics so that no Trainer gets\nleft in the dust! Even if you’re new to this stuff,\r\nhave no fear![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_01_battle_06	Leave it to me and my muscles, and you’ll be\npros in no time.\c\nLet’s set our fighting spirits ablaze—together![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_01_battle_07	Pokémon have all kinds of attack moves at their\ndisposal, and each move has certain qualities\r\nthat you’ll want to remember![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_01_battle_08	I’m talking about the power, type, and [VAR FF00(0006)]category[VAR FF00(0000)]\nof these moves![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_01_battle_09	Higher power means more damage—especially if\nyour opponent is weak to that move’s type![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_01_battle_10	Heads up, new kid! Question coming your way!\c\nThere are two categories that attack moves can\nfall under. Know what they are?[VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_01_select_01	Moves of light and moves of darkness
class_e_01_select_02	Physical moves and special moves
class_e_01_select_03	Moves you love and moves you hate
class_e_01_battle_answer_01	That’s not only wrong—it’s totally out there!\c\nAre you OK, new kid?! Or are you just at that\nage where you’re really into fantasy stuff?[VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_01_battle_answer_02	Awesome! You’re just as sharp as I expected, new\nkid! Looks like you have a handle on the basics![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_01_battle_answer_03	That’s not only wrong—it’s kinda sad!\c\nAre you OK, new kid?! Or are you just at that\nage where you’re really into bittersweet stuff?[VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_01_battle_11	Anyway, attack moves are split into two\ncategories—[VAR FF00(0006)]physical[VAR FF00(0000)] and [VAR FF00(0006)]special[VAR FF00(0000)]![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_01_battle_12	Physical moves do more damage the higher the\nPokémon’s [VAR FF00(0006)]Attack[VAR FF00(0000)] stat is![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_01_battle_13	And special moves do more damage the higher\nthe Pokémon’s [VAR FF00(0006)]Sp. Atk[VAR FF00(0000)] stat is![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_01_battle_14	On the other side of things, Pokémon getting hit\nby these moves can take less damage by having\r\na high [VAR FF00(0006)]Defense[VAR FF00(0000)] or [VAR FF00(0006)]Sp. Def [VAR FF00(0000)]stat, respectively![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_01_battle_15	In conclusion![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_01_battle_16	Pokémon that are good with [VAR FF00(0006)]physical moves[VAR FF00(0000)]\nshould raise their [VAR FF00(0006)]Attack[VAR FF00(0000)] stat!\c\nAnd Pokémon that are good with [VAR FF00(0006)]special moves[VAR FF00(0000)]\nshould raise their [VAR FF00(0006)]Sp. Atk[VAR FF00(0000)] stat![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_01_battle_17	Trying to raise both of these stats equally will just\nmake it hard for the Pokémon to shine in battle![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_01_battle_18	Make your strong points stronger, I always say—\nthat goes for both people and Pokémon![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_01_battle_19	Aw, man! I was just about to suggest we do some\nhands-on practice to really drive the point home,\r\nbut I guess we’re out of time...[VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_01_battle_20	We’ll generally meet for my class here in the\nschoolyard—even for book learning!\c\nNothing like a little fresh air to make studying\nmore fun, am I right?[VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_01_battle_21	But class is over for now! Take care, you little\nrascals![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_02.dat
class_e_02_battle_01	Another day, another round of battle study! Osu!\nLet’s get right to it![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_02_battle_02	Is everyone excited about the Treasure Hunt?![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_02_battle_03	It’s always a great adventure! You get to take on\nGyms, go to new places, and run all over the\r\nplace with your partner Pokémon![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_02_battle_04	And, while you’re running around out there,\nI’ll bet you’ll come across some big, shining\r\n[VAR FF00(0006)]crystals [VAR FF00(0000)]fairly often as well.[VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_02_battle_05	These crystals are actually collections of Terastal\nenergy that’s seeped up out of the ground![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_02_battle_06	You can check out these crystals to battle Tera\nPokémon with your friends or other Trainers in a\r\ngroup of four.[VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_02_battle_07	We call those battles...Tera Raid Battles![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_02_battle_08	The Tera Pokémon you’ll face off against in Tera\nRaid Battles are crazy tough![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_02_battle_09	They sometimes act differently than regular\nPokémon, so you’ll need to be on your guard![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_02_battle_10	Luckily, Trainers can also use a special action in\nTera Raid Battles. It’s called [VAR FF00(0006)]cheering[VAR FF00(0000)]![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_02_battle_11	And there are three different cheers you can use![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_02_battle_12	The first cheer is “[VAR FF00(0006)]Go all out![VAR FF00(0000)]” It boosts the\nAttack and Sp. Atk of all ally Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_02_battle_13	The second is “[VAR FF00(0006)]Hang tough![VAR FF00(0000)]” This one boosts\nthe Defense and Sp. Def of all ally Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_02_battle_14	And the third— Well, let’s see if you can guess![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_02_battle_15	This cheer restores HP for all ally Pokémon.\nWhat do you think it is?[VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_02_select_01	Heal up!
class_e_02_select_02	Wham-Bam Potion!
class_e_02_select_03	Explosive healing wave!
class_e_02_battle_answer_01	That’s right! Maybe I should make YOU the battle\nteacher, huh, new kid?![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_02_battle_answer_02	Wham-Bam Potion?! That sounds less like a cheer\nand more like a seriously heavy-handed medical\r\ntreatment or something![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_02_battle_answer_03	Explosive healing wave?! That’s a wild answer if\nI ever heard one! But I think I’d like to give that\r\nmove a whirl if it really existed![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_02_battle_16	The third and final cheer is “[VAR FF00(0006)]Heal up![VAR FF00(0000)]” It’s a real\npowerhouse, with the ability to both restore HP\r\nand cure status conditions![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_02_battle_17	You can cheer up to three times during a single\nTera Raid Battle.[VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_02_battle_18	Also, cheering uses up a turn in battle, so you\nwon’t be able to have your Pokémon use any of\r\ntheir moves when you cheer![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_02_battle_19	In conclusion![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_02_battle_20	Try everything at your disposal! If nothing seems\nto be working, try cheering on your allies![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_02_battle_21	Providing support for your team can sometimes\nopen up a new realm of possibilities![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_02_battle_22	Aw, man! I was just about to suggest we do some\nhands-on practice to really drive the point home,\r\nbut I guess we’re out of time...[VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_02_battle_23	Class is over for now! Take care, you little rascals![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_03.dat
class_e_03_battle_01	Another day, another round of battle study! Osu!\nLet’s get right to it![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_03_battle_02	Last time, we learned about Tera Raid Battles!\nDid any of you have a chance to try them out?[VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_03_battle_03	Tera Pokémon are super strong! And the more\ndifficult ones will use an even tougher tactic that\r\nyou’ll need to deal with.[VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_03_battle_04	I’m talking about their [VAR FF00(0006)]Tera Shield[VAR FF00(0000)]![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_03_battle_05	What happens while a Pokémon has its\nTera Shield up, you ask?[VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_03_battle_06	Well, it’ll take WAAAY less damage, for one![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_03_battle_07	It has a big effect on morale, too![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_03_battle_08	When Trainers see that shield go up, they feel\ndoomed—like there’s no way to win the battle![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_03_battle_09	So, here’s a question for you![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_03_battle_10	If the Pokémon you’re battling puts up its Tera\nShield, what should you do?[VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_03_select_01	Close your eyes and give in
class_e_03_select_02	Call your parents
class_e_03_select_03	Terastallize and attack it
class_e_03_battle_answer_01	What?! Don’t just accept defeat! You should be\nable to find a way out of this predicament if you\r\nkeep on fighting![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_03_battle_answer_02	What?! Don’t call your family to tell them you’re\nabout to lose! You should be able to find a way\r\nout of this predicament if you keep on fighting![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_03_battle_answer_03	That’s right! You’re a regular Tera Raid Battle\nmaster, aren’t you, new kid?[VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_03_battle_11	Regular attacks don’t work so well against\nPokémon that have their Tera Shield up.[VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_03_battle_12	But having your Pokémon Terastallize is an\neffective method to overcome that issue!\c\nA Terastallized Pokémon will do more damage\nto shielded Pokémon—especially if it uses moves\r\nthat match its Tera Type![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_03_battle_13	Dealing enough damage to a Pokémon with its\nTera Shield up can destroy the shield and break\r\nthe Pokémon’s stance![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_03_battle_14	This means that it’s important to properly time\nyour Terastallizing in Tera Raid Battles.[VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_03_battle_15	In conclusion![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_03_battle_16	As they say, fight fire with fire and Tera\nPokémon with Tera Pokémon![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_03_battle_17	Be sure to work together with your teammates to\nsmash through your opponent’s Tera Shield![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_03_battle_18	Aw, man! I was just about to suggest we do some\nhands-on practice to really drive the point home,\r\nbut I guess we’re out of time once again...[VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_03_battle_19	Next class will be our midterm exam! Aim for a\nperfect score! Osu! Osu![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_04.dat
class_e_04_battle_01	Sorry to all of you who went to the schoolyard\nfirst before finding the right room![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_04_battle_02	I guess we can do our tests in the classroom, at\nleast! It might be hard to write your answers out\r\non the field![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_04_battle_03	All right! Time to put on your game faces and do\nbattle with those test sheets![VAR 0114(0024)]

class_e_04_battle_05	I saw you giving it everything you’ve got! I’m sure\nyou’ll all get perfect scores![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_04_battle_06	Well done, everyone. You can ask for your scores\nat the front desk![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_05.dat
class_e_05_battle_01	Another day, another round of battle study! Osu!\nLet’s get right to it![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_05_battle_02	You all gave everything you had on the midterm\nexams. Well done![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_05_battle_03	We’ll resume our regular classes today, so keep\nup that energy for the second half of the term![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_05_battle_04	Have you all been using the R Button to send out\nyour Pokémon?[VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_05_battle_05	If you do, your Pokémon will run off in the\ndirection you’re facing.[VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_05_battle_06	It’s a super-useful tactic that lets your Pokémon\npick up faraway items for you. And that’s not all![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_05_battle_07	If there’s a wild Pokémon near where you sent\nyour Pokémon, they’ll start battling each other![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_05_battle_08	We call those battles...Auto Battles![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_05_battle_09	Just as the name implies, your Pokémon will\nact on its own during Auto Battles—meaning\r\nyou won’t have to give it any commands![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_05_battle_10	And if your Pokémon wins, it’ll get Exp. Points\njust like it would in a regular battle.[VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_05_battle_11	If you make good use of these battles, they can\nbe a really efficient way to train your party![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_05_battle_12	But you’ll want to remember that Pokémon won’t\nevolve or learn new moves right away if they level\r\nup from an Auto Battle.[VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_05_battle_13	Also, if a Pokémon LOSES an Auto Battle, it’ll\ncome back with just a small amount of HP left.\r\nMake sure to heal it up right away![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_05_battle_14	Whoops. I just about did the whole class as a\none-sided lecture. Does anyone have any\r\nquestions so far?[VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_05_select_01	How do I stop an Auto Battle?
class_e_05_select_02	Can I catch wild Pokémon in Auto Battles?
class_e_05_select_03	No questions here!
class_e_05_battle_answer_01	There’s no stopping an Auto Battle once it starts!\nYou’ll have to wait and see how it plays out!\c\nYou can call your Pokémon off before the battle\nstarts, though, if you press the ZR Button while\r\nyour Pokémon is still on its way to the opponent![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_05_battle_answer_02	If you let your Pokémon battle on its own, it’ll\nkeep going until its opponent is defeated!\c\nIf you want to catch a wild Pokémon, you’ll need\nto battle by issuing commands instead![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_05_battle_answer_03	Great! You’re all really good at this. I can’t wait\nto see where you go from here![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_05_battle_15	Even during Auto Battles, our Pokémon are out\nthere battling for us—their Trainers![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_05_battle_16	Keep an eye on them as much as possible, and\nif it looks like they’re going to lose, be sure to\r\nhave them retreat![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_05_battle_17	Also, this goes without saying, but Pokémon with\nlow HP are already worn out.[VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_05_battle_18	They probably won’t enjoy Auto Battles as much,\nso don’t work them too hard, OK?[VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_05_battle_19	In conclusion![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_05_battle_20	Auto Battles only work if a Trainer and their\nPokémon have a relationship of mutual trust![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_05_battle_21	Be smart with how you use Auto Battles so you\ndon’t lose the trust of your Pokémon![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_05_battle_22	Aw, man! I was just about to suggest we do some\nhands-on practice to really drive the point home,\r\nbut I guess we’ve run out of time, as usual...[VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_05_battle_23	Class is over for now! Take care, you little rascals![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_06.dat
class_e_06_battle_01	Another day, another round of battle study! Osu!\nLet’s get right to it![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_06_battle_02	I hope you gave Auto Battles a shot like we\ntalked about last class![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_06_battle_03	Making good use of Auto Battles will let you train\nup a bunch of different Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_06_battle_04	It’s also an efficient way to gather the Pokémon\nmaterials you need to make TMs at TM Machines![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_06_battle_05	Speaking of which! Have you all been using the\nTM Machines?[VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_06_battle_06	I sure hope so, ’cause it’s pop quiz time![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_06_battle_07	To create TMs, you need Pokémon materials and\none other thing. Anyone remember what that is?[VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_06_select_01	LP
class_e_06_select_02	HP
class_e_06_select_03	Money
class_e_06_battle_answer_01	Looks like you’re already a TM Machine pro,\nnew kid![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_06_battle_answer_02	Whoa! Hold on there, new kid! Offering up HP to\ncreate TMs sounds like some kind of ritual or\r\nsomething! That’s not how it’s done![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_06_battle_answer_03	Close, new kid! Close! But don’t think that money\nmakes every little thing in the world go ’round![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_06_battle_08	The correct answer is League Points—or LP\nfor short![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_06_battle_09	You can give LP and Pokémon materials to a TM\nMachine to create TMs. But that’s not all!\c\nYou can also exchange Pokémon materials at a\nTM Machine to get LP![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_06_battle_10	I recently heard about some shady individuals\ngetting LP illegally using a technique called...\r\nhacking? Or something like that.[VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_06_battle_11	I don’t want any of you getting involved in bad\nstuff like that. Got it?![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_06_battle_12	Anyway, you can also add TMs that you want to\nmake to your watch list. This will let you keep an\r\neye on the materials you need to gather![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_06_battle_13	In conclusion![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_06_battle_14	In order to make TMs, you need Pokémon\nmaterials![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_06_battle_15	And if you want to get hold of lots of materials,\nyou’ll have to battle all kinds of Pokémon![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_06_battle_16	Aw, man! I was just about to suggest we do some\nhands-on practice to really drive the point home,\r\nbut I guess we’re never gonna have the time...[VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_06_battle_17	Class is over for now! Take care, you little rascals![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_07.dat
class_e_07_battle_01	Osu! This is our last class, but don’t let those\nenergy levels drop before we wrap things up![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_07_battle_02	You’ve shown that you have more than enough\nknowledge to be superstrong battlers![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_07_battle_03	I don’t know that I have much left to teach you...[VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_07_battle_04	but we can always aim for ever-greater heights![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_07_battle_05	So today, I’m going to teach you about the rules\nof Link Battles![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_07_battle_06	When two Trainers participate in Link Battles\ntogether, they can engage in either Single Battles\r\nor Double Battles with each other![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_07_battle_07	And if you’re playing in a group of four, you can\nall battle each other in Multi Battles![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_07_battle_08	Now, when you’re out having battles during your\nindependent study, you can use whatever number\r\nof Pokémon you like—and they can be any level![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_07_battle_09	But, in Link Battles, there are special rules to\nkeep in mind.[VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_07_battle_10	Some of these special rules involve adjusting\nPokémon’s levels![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_07_battle_11	Now, the [VAR FF00(0006)]No Restrictions [VAR FF00(0000)]rule set lets all Pokémon\nstay at their current level.\c\nIt lets Trainers use multiple Pokémon of the same\nspecies and multiples of the same held item, too![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_07_battle_12	But if you choose to use [VAR FF00(0006)]Normal Rules[VAR FF00(0000)], all\nPokémon will be set to Lv. 50 for your battles—\r\nregardless of what level they actually are.[VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_07_battle_13	This even includes lower-level Pokémon. They’ll\nget a power boost to participate![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_07_battle_14	Normal Rules let you use multiples of the same\nPokémon species and of the same held items too.[VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_07_battle_15	The great part about this rule set is that it lets\nany of your Pokémon participate—all they have\r\nto do is learn some good moves![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_07_battle_16	Lastly, the rule set called [VAR FF00(0006)]Flat Rules[VAR FF00(0000)] mostly affects\nPokémon over Lv. 50. Such Pokémon will be set\r\nto Lv. 50 for the duration of the battle![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_07_battle_17	The Flat Rules rule set is the one often used for\nofficial tournaments.[VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_07_battle_18	This rule set does NOT allow Trainers to use\nmultiple Pokémon of the same species or\r\nmultiples of the same held item![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_07_battle_19	All right. Here’s a question for you![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_07_battle_20	Which rule set should you pick if you want to use\na lower-level Pokémon and keep its level low?[VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_07_select_01	Normal Rules
class_e_07_select_02	Flat Rules
class_e_07_battle_answer_01	Oooh, gotcha there! Normal Rules adjusts all\nPokémon to Lv. 50—even lower-level ones![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_07_battle_answer_02	That’s the one, new kid! Looks like you were\nlistening to the lesson![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_07_battle_21	If you’ve got some clever strategy that you need\nto use a Lv. 5 Pokémon for, your best bet is to\r\nchoose the Flat Rules rule set![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_07_battle_22	Of course, you can also choose No Restrictions if\nyou want to battle with any Pokémon you want—\r\nat any level and with any held item![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_07_battle_23	That’s a pretty good rule set for when you want\nto battle freely with friends.[VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_07_battle_24	In conclusion![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_07_battle_25	Normal Rules adjusts all Pokémon to Lv. 50!\c\nFlat Rules lets you use lower-level Pokémon at\ntheir actual levels![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_07_battle_26	I hope you’ll use these tips to have some exciting\nbattles with your friends![VAR 0114(0024)]
class_e_07_battle_27	Aw, man! I was just about to suggest we do some\nhands-on practice to really drive the point home,\r\nbut I guess we truly are out of time...[VAR 0114(0024)]

class_f_01_dragon_01	Greetings, I am Hassel. I will be teaching this art\nclass. It is a pleasure to meet you all![VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_01_dragon_02	Now, let me be candid for one moment.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_01_dragon_03	I imagine that many of you will forget all that\nyou learned in this class once you graduate![VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_01_dragon_04	After all, you don’t need even a basic\nunderstanding of artwork, much less a refined\r\nappreciation of beauty, for most exams or jobs.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_01_dragon_05	So, is my class a waste of time for you, then?[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_01_dragon_06	I think not! At least, I certainly hope it isn’t![VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_01_dragon_07	Think for a moment, all of you. What is beauty,\nanyway? What makes something beautiful?[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_01_select_01	Its shape and color
class_f_01_select_02	The eye of the beholder
class_f_01_select_03	I don’t know
class_f_01_dragon_answer_01	Interesting... Thank you, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_01_dragon_08	Oh, I don’t mean to suggest there’s a correct\nanswer to my query. The important thing is that\r\nyou all take time to think about it.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_01_dragon_09	Think about why we might find beauty in a flower\nblooming on the side of the road, for example.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_01_dragon_10	Question why the sky is a different shade of blue\nthan the ocean or why the leaves change color.\c\nPonder the windmills of Artazon and how they\nmove. Contemplate the chilling bite of the\r\nwaters of Cascarrafa.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_01_dragon_11	I’m sure you will find that every little detail of\nyour lives will seem more vivid, more impactful,\r\nif you just take a moment to stop and think.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_01_dragon_12	And I am certain that if you stop and truly\nappreciate the little beauties of this world...[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_01_dragon_13	it will help pull you through the days where your\nstudies have you exhausted or when work has\r\ndampened your spirits.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_01_dragon_14	Ah, do pardon me for waxing philosophical.\nYou don’t need to understand all of that now.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_01_dragon_15	To put it simply, it is true that one doesn’t need\nart to survive... But it certainly makes surviving\r\nmuch more enjoyable![VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_01_dragon_16	It is my hope that this class will add even a little\nbit of color to your lives.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_01_dragon_17	That’s all for today—next time, we’ll try a more\nhands-on approach to appreciating beauty![VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_02.dat
class_f_02_dragon_01	Hello, class! It is I, Hassel, yet again.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_02_dragon_02	In our previous class, we discussed what beauty\nis...which might have been a little boring for you.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_02_dragon_03	So today, I thought I would mix things up a little\nto pique your interest in art.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_02_dragon_04	Allow me to introduce our special guest![VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_02_poke_01	Gib gibble.
class_f_02_dragon_05	This is Professor Gible, the assistant lecturer\nfor today.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_02_dragon_06	Now then, Professor Gible. If you would be so\nkind as to Terastallize for us...[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_02_poke_02	Glaaam!
class_f_02_dragon_07	As some of you may already know, a Pokémon\ncan Terastallize if you use a Tera Orb.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_02_dragon_08	Normally, Professor Gible would be of the\nDragon type...[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_02_dragon_09	But by Terastallizing, it’s succeeded in changing\nits type![VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_02_dragon_10	So, class...what type do these lovely, glistening\nflowers above Professor Gible’s head represent?[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_02_select_01	The Grass type
class_f_02_select_02	The Fire type
class_f_02_select_03	The Water type
class_f_02_dragon_answer_01	[VAR BD06(0000)]Excellent, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nFull marks\r\nfor you![VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_02_dragon_answer_02	[VAR BD06(0000)]Ah, not quite, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nActually,\r\nthe\r\ntype\r\nin\r\nquestion\r\nis\r\nweak\r\nto\r\nthe\r\nFire type![VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_02_dragon_answer_03	[VAR BD06(0000)]Ah, not quite, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nActually,\r\nthe\r\ntype\r\nin\r\nquestion\r\nis\r\nstrong\r\nagainst\r\nthe\r\nWater type![VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_02_dragon_11	These beautiful flowers blooming above\nProfessor Gible’s head show that it has now\r\nbecome a Grass type.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_02_dragon_12	The shape of the [VAR FF00(0006)]Tera Jewel[VAR FF00(0000)] above a Pokémon’s\nhead depends on the Pokémon’s Tera Type.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_02_dragon_13	To summarize! If an opponent’s Pokémon\nTerastallizes during battle...[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_02_dragon_14	observe a Pokémon’s Tera Jewel closely to see\nwhich type it has become![VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_02_dragon_15	And choose effective moves accordingly![VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_02_dragon_16	It is my sincere hope that today’s lecture will\nhelp you all achieve beautiful victories.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_02_dragon_17	The Terastal phenomenon is indeed a fascinating\nand deep subject to discuss.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_02_dragon_18	That is it for today, class! Thank you, Professor\nGible, for your help.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_02_poke_03	Glam-gib.

class_f_03_dragon_01	Hello, class! It is I, Hassel, yet again.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_03_dragon_02	I’ve been told that my previous lecture about\nthe Terastal phenomenon was very well received.\r\nThank you all for your kind words![VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_03_dragon_03	In fact, Ms. Dendra specifically requested that\nI impart even more battle knowledge to\r\nmy students...[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_03_dragon_04	So, I have decided that today we will take\nanother look at how a Pokémon can Terastallize![VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_03_poke_01	Gib gibble.
class_f_03_dragon_05	And of course, here is Professor Gible to help us.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_03_dragon_06	Now then, Professor Gible. If you would be so\nkind as to Terastallize for us...[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_03_poke_02	Glaaam!
class_f_03_dragon_07	Now, what do we have here? Last class we saw\nGrass-type Terastallizing, but this time we have\r\nsomething of a different shape.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_03_dragon_08	Observe, a Tera Jewel resembling a snowflake!\nIts dendritic shape is stunning to behold.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_03_dragon_09	It’s a little chilly standing so close to it...[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_03_dragon_10	So, class... What Tera Type do you imagine this\njewel might represent?[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_03_select_01	The Water type
class_f_03_select_02	The Ice type
class_f_03_select_03	The Ghost type
class_f_03_dragon_answer_01	[VAR BD06(0000)]Very close, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nThis is\r\nwater...\r\nbut\r\nin\r\na\r\ndifferent state![VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_03_dragon_answer_02	[VAR BD06(0000)]Excellent, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nFull marks\r\nfor you![VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_03_dragon_answer_03	[VAR BD06(0000)]Ah, not exactly, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nThough\r\nI\r\nsuppose\r\nthat\r\nis\r\nchilling\r\nin\r\nits\r\nown\r\nway, too![VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_03_dragon_11	The reason there’s a snowflake shining above\nProfessor Gible’s head is simple—it is now\r\nan Ice type![VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_03_dragon_12	And because Professor Gible is currently the\nIce type...[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_03_dragon_13	Ice-type moves would not be very effective\nagainst it. Keep in mind, usually they would\r\ndeal quadruple damage to Gible![VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_03_dragon_14	Now, here’s some trivia about snowflakes:\nwhile snowflakes come in many different shapes\r\nand sizes, most are classified as hexagons![VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_03_dragon_15	Just think of it... Snowflakes fall from the sky,\ntaking similar shapes without anyone saying\r\nthey must.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_03_dragon_16	Do you not feel the great mystery of nature?\nThe beautiful enigma we live in?![VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_03_dragon_17	*cough*\c\nAh, this is a bit of a tangent, but Mr. Jacq’s\nglasses are also hexagonal, aren’t they.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_03_dragon_18	I almost forgot to mention that you can change\na Pokémon’s Tera Type at the [VAR FF00(0006)]Treasure Eatery[VAR FF00(0000)]\r\nlocated in Medali.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_03_dragon_19	Though I must say the cook there is a little...\nprickly—you’ll need to get on her good side if\r\nyou want her help.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_03_dragon_20	Now, come prepared for next class, because it is\ntime for your midterm examination!\c\nThank you for today, Professor Gible.[VAR 0114(0012)]

class_f_05_dragon_04	Now then, Brassie, please come in![VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_05_kusa_01	Greetings![VAR 0114(002C)]
class_f_05_kusa_02	I am Brassius. I am an artist, and I focus\nexclusively on Grass-type Pokémon for my work.[VAR 0114(0017)]
class_f_05_dragon_05	Brassius here mainly creates three-dimensional\npieces, such as statues and the like.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_05_dragon_06	One of his major works is the installation titled\nSurrendering Sunflora, found in Artazon.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_05_dragon_07	Many of you who’ve challenged the Artazon Gym\nare no doubt familiar with these sculptures.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_05_kusa_03	Yes...I do recognize some faces among your\nstudents.[VAR 0114(0017)]
class_f_05_kusa_04	I hope you all understand how fortunate you are\nto be able to attend Hass’s classes.[VAR 0114(0017)]
class_f_05_kusa_05	Ol’ Hass is the man who saved me when I had\nlost all hope and given up on myself.[VAR 0114(0017)]
class_f_05_kusa_06	But he never gave up on me. I do not exaggerate\nwhen I say that he is my mentor in life![VAR 0114(0017)]
class_f_05_kusa_07	It is precisely thanks to Hass that I was able to\nestablish my current art style.[VAR 0114(0017)]
class_f_05_dragon_08	Ah, dear Brassie![VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_05_dragon_09	I’ve nothing against reminiscing about old times,\nbut today, I hope you will guide this class in a\r\nway only you can![VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_05_kusa_08	Of course![VAR 0114(0017)]
class_f_05_kusa_09	Let’s see... Ah, why don’t we discuss what Hass\nmentioned—Surrendering Sunflora?[VAR 0114(0017)]
class_f_05_kusa_10	Can anyone here tell what my mood was when I\ncrafted its detached expression?[VAR 0114(0017)]
class_f_05_select_01	A happy mood
class_f_05_select_02	A sad mood
class_f_05_select_03	An angry mood
class_f_05_kusa_11	No, no, no... Completely and utterly wrong![VAR 0114(0017)]
class_f_05_kusa_12	When I made that sculpture, I had surrendered\nall hope. I was prepared to give up everything.[VAR 0114(0017)]
class_f_05_kusa_13	I had resolved to give up my life as an artist if\nthat piece did not receive proper recognition.[VAR 0114(0017)]
class_f_05_dragon_10	Hence the name Surrendering Sunflora?[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_05_kusa_14	That’s exactly it, Hass![VAR 0114(0017)]
class_f_05_kusa_15	When I started out as an artist, I experienced\nmany hardships. I even became deathly ill and\r\nfell into a slump that drove me to desperation.[VAR 0114(0017)]
class_f_05_kusa_16	I began worrying only about what would sell.\nI was concerned only with fame and fortune...[VAR 0114(0017)]
class_f_05_kusa_17	But all of my pieces during this time had no\ndepth. They were all shallow trash![VAR 0114(0017)]
class_f_05_kusa_18	It was then that I met Hass. He helped me realize\nhow petty I was being. I’ll spare you the details...\r\nbut in the end I was able to leave all that behind![VAR 0114(0017)]
class_f_05_kusa_19	And that is also when I crafted the Sunflora![VAR 0114(0017)]
class_f_05_dragon_11	Remarkable! Even I did not know the full story\nuntil now![VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_05_kusa_20	This kind of thing is hard to tell someone,\nespecially when they are so close to you.[VAR 0114(0017)]
class_f_05_kusa_21	Now, I don’t doubt that you adolescents will\noften find your heads crowded with worries.[VAR 0114(0017)]
class_f_05_kusa_22	My advice to you is simple. Be honest with\nyourself, and do whatever your heart desires.\r\n...So long as you don’t cause trouble, that is.[VAR 0114(0017)]
class_f_05_kusa_23	That is all from me.[VAR 0114(0017)]
class_f_05_kusa_24	I must admit I am beginning to feel a bit\nembarrassed, so I bid you farewell, Hass!\r\nAnd farewell to your pupils as well![VAR 0114(0017)]
class_f_05_dragon_12	Oh Brassie, I can’t believe it... Such a wonderful...\nclass... Thank...[VAR 0114(0012)]

class_f_06_dragon_02	First, allow me to apologize for losing my\ncomposure during our last class...[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_06_dragon_03	I was so touched by Brassius’s story that I simply\ncouldn’t contain my emotions. I’m sorry for\r\nmaking such a scene.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_06_dragon_04	I certainly got a very stern talking-to from\nMs. Tyme after that class, yes...[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_06_dragon_05	Anyway, let us shift gears and dive into the\nmaterial for today’s class![VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_06_dragon_06	Now, have any of you heard of the Ten Sights\nof Paldea?[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_06_dragon_07	As the name would imply, they are ten sights in\nPaldea that are considered particularly beautiful.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_06_dragon_08	Among them, I would say that the[VAR FF00(0006)] Grand Olive[VAR FF00(0000)]\n[VAR FF00(0006)]Orchard[VAR FF00(0000)] is likely the most accessible.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_06_dragon_09	You can see field after field of olive trees from\nthe hill on the way to Cortondo.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_06_dragon_10	Two waterfalls are also counted among these\nten sights—[VAR FF00(0006)]Fury Falls[VAR FF00(0000)] and [VAR FF00(0006)]Casseroya Falls[VAR FF00(0000)].[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_06_dragon_11	Then there’s the peak of Glaseado Mountain,\nknown as [VAR FF00(0006)]Paldea’s Highest Peak[VAR FF00(0000)].[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_06_dragon_12	There’s another cliff on Glaseado Mountain that’s\nnamed after its rather unique shape.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_06_dragon_13	So, let me ask you, my students![VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_06_dragon_14	What is the name of the three-pronged cliff on\nGlaseado Mountain? No need to grasp at straws![VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_06_select_01	Glaseado’s Grasp
class_f_06_select_02	Glaseado’s Reach
class_f_06_select_03	Glaseado’s Run
class_f_06_dragon_answer_01	[VAR BD06(0000)]Exactly! It looks like a hand taking hold of\nsomething, doesn’t it, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_06_dragon_answer_02	A very good guess! I’d think something reaching\nwould stretch out farther, though.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_06_dragon_answer_03	A unique take! But that sort of name would\nusually apply to a slope, don’t you think?[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_06_dragon_15	The three-pronged cliff on Glaseado Mountain\nis in fact known as [VAR FF00(0006)]Glaseado’s Grasp[VAR FF00(0000)].[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_06_dragon_16	Though its shape is far too stubby to be that\nof a human hand. I imagine someone thought it\r\nlooked like a Pokémon hand grabbing something.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_06_dragon_17	There’s also the mountains in Area Three of the\nEast Province, where you can get a good look at\r\nLevincia. It’s particularly gorgeous at night![VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_06_dragon_18	In fact, the view is so brilliant, it is known as the\n[VAR FF00(0006)]Million Volt Skyline[VAR FF00(0000)].[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_06_dragon_19	I hear it’s quite a hotspot for dates—and\ndeservedly so for having such a romantic view![VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_06_dragon_20	I imagine it’s...what do the kids say these days...\na very, ahem, “fleek selfie spot”?[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_06_dragon_21	Of course, you may feel that not all ten sights live\nup to their grandiose names. How often do we\r\nvisit some tourist spot only to be disappointed?[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_06_dragon_22	Not to say that you shouldn’t visit them, only\nthat you should keep your hopes in check.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_06_dragon_23	The important thing is to go yourself and see\nthem with your own two eyes.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_06_dragon_24	And sometimes, a disappointing experience can\nbe worthwhile in its own way. Take a chance![VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_06_dragon_25	Well, that’s it for today, class. Thank you for\nyour attention![VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_07.dat
class_f_07_dragon_01	Hello, class! It is I, Hassel, yet again.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_07_dragon_02	My, my, how time flies, as they say![VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_07_dragon_03	Indeed, our time together has certainly flown by.\nIt’s hard to believe that this is our last class.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_07_dragon_04	Now, our topics for today may feel somewhat\nunrelated to art.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_07_dragon_05	But there is absolutely no set definition as to\nwhat art should be![VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_07_dragon_06	Therefore, let us carry on with the discussion and\nsee where it takes us![VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_07_dragon_07	There are two things I wish to focus on today—\nRibbons...and marks![VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_07_dragon_08	Both Ribbons and marks are special honors that\ncapture a Pokémon’s qualities.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_07_dragon_09	There will be times when your Pokémon gives\nmaximum effort or has a noteworthy experience.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_07_dragon_10	In recognition of its feats and accomplishments,\nit can be given a Ribbon.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_07_dragon_11	To give an example, if you manage to become\nincredibly close to a Pokémon, it may be granted\r\nthe Best Friends Ribbon.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_07_dragon_12	Incidentally, there is a person in Cascarrafa who\ncan give your Pokémon a Best Friends Ribbon.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_07_dragon_13	Marks, on the other hand, are mostly found on\nwild Pokémon when you meet them for the\r\nfirst time.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_07_dragon_14	They can symbolize the character of a Pokémon,\nsuch as with the Rowdy Mark or the Vigor Mark.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_07_dragon_15	It’s completely up to luck whether you’ll run into\na Pokémon with these marks![VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_07_dragon_16	So if you’re able to catch a Pokémon with a\nmark, rejoice at your outstanding fortune![VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_07_dragon_17	Does anyone know what special thing you can do\nwith Pokémon that have Ribbons or marks?[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_07_select_01	You can exchange Ribbons!
class_f_07_select_02	You can show them off!
class_f_07_select_03	You can change their title!
class_f_07_dragon_answer_01	Ah, unfortunately, you can’t transfer Ribbons or\nmarks from one Pokémon to another, nor can you\r\ntrade them with other people’s Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_07_dragon_answer_02	Well, yes, indeed you can show them off, but\nsurely that’s not the extent of your interest, is it?[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_07_dragon_answer_03	[VAR BD06(0000)]Wonderful, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Your\nknowledge\r\nis\r\nimpressive.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_07_dragon_18	The correct answer is that Pokémon with Ribbons\nor marks can be given titles.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_07_dragon_19	What’s more, they can be sent into battle\ndisplaying a title of your choosing![VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_07_dragon_20	For example, you could send out a Gible with\na Best Friends Ribbon by declaring...\r\n“Go! Gible the Great Friend!”[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_07_dragon_21	And while I know I just said that marks are\ngenerally found already on Pokémon when you\r\nmeet them for the first time...[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_07_dragon_22	it seems that more recently, Pokémon can be\nawarded certain marks based on their efforts.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_07_dragon_23	These are marks such as the Gourmand Mark,\nthe Itemfinder Mark, the Partner Mark, and so on.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_07_dragon_24	Perhaps it might be fun to try to work out how to\nget each mark using its name as a clue?[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_07_dragon_25	Well, that just about wraps up our last class![VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_07_dragon_26	Next is the final exam. Please review our material\nclosely so that you pass on your first try![VAR 0114(0012)]
class_f_08.dat
class_f_08_dragon_01	I do hope you’re all ready, because it is time for\nyour final exam! Focus and do your best![VAR 0114(0012)]

class_f_08_dragon_07	And that’s that! Good work, everyone! You can\nreceive your results from the front desk.[VAR 0114(0012)]
class_g_01.dat
class_g_01_home_01	I see we have some energetic young ones in our\nclass this time around.[VAR 0114(002C)]
class_g_01_home_02	You may call me Mr. Saguaro.\c\nYour time here with me will be spent obtaining\nknowledge and skills indispensable for daily life.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_01_home_03	Many of you have left the care of your parents to\nlive here on your own in the academy dormitory.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_01_home_04	I pray that the knowledge I impart to you will\nimprove the quality of your lives and the\r\nnecessities thereof—food, clothing, and shelter.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_01_home_05	Of those three categories, I assume the most\npressing and interesting for you all is food.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_01_home_06	When you eat sandwiches on your picnics, the HP\nof your party Pokémon will be restored.\c\nYou will also gain something called [VAR FF00(0006)]Meal Powers[VAR FF00(0000)],\nwhich can provide all manner of benefits.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_01_home_07	For example, these powers can make Pokémon\neasier to catch or increase the Exp. Points that\r\nyour Pokémon receive.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_01_home_08	I think you will also find that the breadth of these\neffects can be expanded by crafting sandwiches\r\nof superb flavor.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_01_home_09	What’s more, there is a certain something that is\nparticularly important if we wish to receive Meal\r\nPowers with even more helpful effects.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_01_home_10	Let me see... M[VAR 1100(00FF,0305)]asteriss [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nTell me—what must you keep in mind to receive\neven more helpful Meal Powers?[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_01_select_01	My choice of fillings and condiments
class_g_01_select_02	How fast I can prepare the food
class_g_01_select_03	I have to remember to put my heart into it!
class_g_01_home_answer_01	[VAR BD06(0000)]Perfectly correct, M[VAR 1100(00FF,0305)]asteriss\n[VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nPerhaps you were already aware of this fact from\nhaving helped your family with cooking at home?[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_01_home_answer_02	That is...incorrect. I pray that you all put more\nemphasis on doing things well when cooking\r\nrather than simply rushing to finish quickly.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_01_home_answer_03	Ha! That is an interesting take. Though not\nexactly what I was looking for, I suppose you are\r\ncorrect, in a sense.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_01_home_11	Your choice of ingredients—including both fillings\nand condiments—is an important factor in gaining\r\neven more helpful Meal Powers.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_01_home_12	For example, using sweet ingredients in your\nsandwiches may help you gain Egg Power.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_01_home_13	Including numerous bitter ingredients, on the\nother hand, can gain you Item Drop Power.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_01_home_14	Learning to aim for specific effects when crafting\nsandwiches will almost certainly make your\r\nculinary endeavors more enjoyable.\c\nPlease be aware, however, that you can also\nreceive Meal Powers by eating at restaurants.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_01_home_15	I must say that I would feel the utmost joy if you\nall learned much here in my class and came to\r\nbetter understand home economics.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_01_home_16	Our time together has come to an end for today.\nI bid you all farewell.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_02.dat
class_g_02_home_01	Put away your phones. It is time to begin class.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_02_home_02	In our last class, I believe we talked about the\neffects you can get from food on your picnics.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_02_home_03	You can receive Meal Powers and even restore\nHP for all the Pokémon in your party. It is a truly\r\nconvenient means of healing your Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_02_home_04	Unfortunately, as I’m sure you are aware, it is not\nsuited for use in battles—when you cannot make\r\nfood—or when you wish to restore HP quickly.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_02_home_05	In times such as those, you should make use of\nhealing items—such as [VAR FF00(0006)]Potions[VAR FF00(0000)], which you can\r\npurchase from Poké Marts or the school store.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_02_home_06	Healing items are immediately effective and can\nbe used anytime that you can open your Bag.\r\nThey are, however, consumed after one use.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_02_home_07	Potions restore 20 HP, Super Potions restore\n60 HP, and Hyper Potions restore 120 HP.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_02_home_08	The pricier the item, the more HP it will restore.\nKeep in mind how much money you have when\r\nyou are stocking up on these items.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_02_home_09	However, unforeseen happenings are an\ninextricable part of traveling from place to place.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_02_home_10	Imagine, if you will, the following scenario: you\nfind yourself with injured Pokémon, but you have\r\nno Potions, you are out of sandwich ingredients,\r\nand there are no Pokémon Centers nearby.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_02_home_11	Tell me, M[VAR 1100(00FF,0305)]asteriss [VAR 0100(0000)]...\c\nWhat should you search for when in a perilous\nsituation with no way to heal your Pokémon?[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_02_select_01	A place with water
class_g_02_select_02	A teacher
class_g_02_select_03	Items on the ground
class_g_02_home_answer_01	Would you hope to use the water to prepare a\nbracing meal perhaps?\c\nAs I mentioned, you have no ingredients, so even\nwith water, you would not be able to make food.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_02_home_answer_02	Ah, yes. Of course, if a teacher were nearby, they\ncould likely be of assistance.\c\nHowever, you must not assume that a grown up\nwill always be nearby to rush to your aid.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_02_home_answer_03	[VAR BD06(0000)]Perfectly correct, M[VAR 1100(00FF,0305)]asteriss\n[VAR 0100(0000)]!\r\nI see\r\nyou\r\nare\r\nwell-learned\r\nin\r\nsurvival techniques.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_02_home_12	If you see something shiny on the ground, it is\nactually an item that has been dropped there!\c\nYou may be able to find a restorative item, such\nas an Oran Berry or a Potion, in this way.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_02_home_13	You can use the [VAR FF00(0006)]R Button[VAR FF00(0000)] to send out your\nPokémon to pick up such items as well.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_02_home_14	And then there are Berries, of course.\c\nBerries, by the way, aren’t like items from shops—\nif you let your Pokémon hold one, it will decide\r\non its own when to eat the Berry during battle.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_02_home_15	Letting your Pokémon decide this timing for itself\ncan be quite interesting![VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_02_home_16	At any rate, if you find yourself in need of\nhealing, I suggest that you look around for\r\nshining items on the ground.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_02_home_17	If you can’t find such items, there are other\nmethods you may employ for healing your—\c\nAh, but I see the bell demands that topic wait.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_02_home_18	Our time together has come to an end for today.\nI bid you all farewell.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_03.dat
class_g_03_home_01	Put away your phones. It is time to begin class.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_03_home_02	In my last class, I taught about HP restoration.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_03_home_03	However, after class, I was asked by several of\nyou about [VAR FF00(0006)]Power Points[VAR FF00(0000)], commonly known as [VAR FF00(0006)]PP[VAR FF00(0000)].[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_03_home_04	When a Pokémon loses all of its HP, it faints and\ncan no longer battle![VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_03_home_05	What, then, happens to a Pokémon when it loses\nall of its PP?[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_03_select_01	It can’t use moves
class_g_03_select_02	It won’t listen to its Trainer
class_g_03_select_03	All of its stats get lowered
class_g_03_home_answer_01	[VAR BD06(0000)]Perfectly correct, M[VAR 1100(00FF,0305)]asteriss\n[VAR 0100(0000)]!\r\nPerhaps\r\nyou\r\nknow\r\nthis\r\nfrom\r\nfirsthand experience?[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_03_home_answer_02	That would certainly be a dangerous situation,\nbut that is not the correct answer.\c\nWhether a Pokémon listens to its Trainer depends\non the number of Gym Badges the Trainer has.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_03_home_answer_03	That would certainly be a dangerous situation,\nbut that is not the correct answer.\c\nThat is not the sort of power we are talking\nabout when we talk of Power Points.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_03_home_06	When a Pokémon runs out of PP, it can no longer\nuse its moves.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_03_home_07	However, each move has its own store of PP, so\nyou can mitigate PP loss by using a variety of\r\nmoves rather than just one move repeatedly.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_03_home_08	If a Pokémon loses all PP for all of its moves, it\nwill only be able to use Struggle—an action that\r\nalso damages the Pokémon that uses it.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_03_home_09	In order to avoid this predicament, PP can be\nrestored at Pokémon Centers along with HP.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_03_home_10	Items such as Ethers and Max Ethers can also be\nused to restore PP. Be careful not to confuse\r\nPotions with Ethers in the heat of battle![VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_03_home_11	However, Ethers are not sold at shops, so you\nshould use them judiciously if you find them.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_03_home_12	The stronger the move, the lower its maximum PP.\c\nDo not waste uses of these moves unless you wish\nto quickly run out of PP. It is important to find\r\nbalance in a Pokémon’s set of moves.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_03_home_13	As you can see, HP isn’t the only thing you must\nkeep an eye on while adventuring with Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_03_home_14	I hope that you will all take care to ensure that\nyour partner Pokémon can perform at their best\r\nas you each engage in the Treasure Hunt.[VAR 0114(0029)]

class_g_05.dat
class_g_05_home_01	Put away your phones. It is time to begin class.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_05_home_02	Though some of you had to retake the midterm\nexam multiple times, I am glad to say that the\r\nmajority of the class passed without issue.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_05_home_03	I feel honored to see that the knowledge and\nskills indispensable for daily life have taken root\r\nin all of you.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_05_home_04	I trust that you will all work just as hard on your\nlife skills in this second half of our course as well.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_05_home_05	Let us now turn our attention to the topic of the\nday, which was inspired by a question I received\r\non the subject of Meal Powers.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_05_home_06	The student who asked this question is a young\nman who enjoys the culinary arts.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_05_home_07	He tells me that he regularly researches culinary\ntechniques on his own and pays careful attention\r\nto the ingredients he uses.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_05_home_08	He also spends day and night studying all aspects\nof the culinary arts.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_05_home_09	Yet despite this, he is baffled by his inability to\nincrease the effectiveness of his Meal Powers.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_05_home_10	[VAR BD06(0000)]So tell me, M[VAR 1100(00FF,0305)]asteriss [VAR 0100(0000)],\nsince\r\nyou\r\ndid\r\nquite\r\nwell\r\non\r\nyour\r\nmidterm\r\nexam...[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_05_home_11	What should Ar—ahem, this young man—do to\nincrease the effectiveness of his Meal Powers?[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_05_select_01	He should make food more often
class_g_05_select_02	He should make food with other people
class_g_05_select_03	Ar...ven?
class_g_05_home_answer_01	The culinary arts are not so easily grasped.\nSimply engaging in them more often will not\r\nnecessarily reward you with success.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_05_home_answer_02	Perfectly correct. I see that you are\nknowledgeable about the culinary arts.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_05_home_answer_03	Ahem... I cannot disclose the identity of this\ncertain male student who enjoys the culinary arts.\r\nIt may very well be Arven, but it may not be![VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_05_home_12	To increase the effectiveness of Meal Powers,\nyour sandwiches must be filled with many\r\ndifferent ingredients.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_05_home_13	For a single person, this may prove difficult. But\nif you prepare a sandwich with others, you will\r\nbe able to handle a larger serving of bread.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_05_home_14	With a larger base to start with, it becomes quite\nsimple to add more ingredients to your sandwich.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_05_home_15	Which, in turn, makes it possible to receive Meal\nPowers of increased effectiveness.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_05_home_16	This applies more broadly as well. When dealing\nwith a difficult issue, working with others to solve\r\nthat issue may be the best course of action.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_05_home_17	I am sure that Arven will likewise work with\nfriends to craft his sandwiches in the future.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_05_home_18	Ahem... The identity of the male student is a\nmatter of privacy, so I would ask that you do not\r\npry too deeply.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_05_home_19	Our time together has come to an end for today.\nI bid you all farewell.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_06.dat
class_g_06_home_01	Put away your phones. It is time to begin class.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_06_home_02	While you’re out performing fieldwork with one\nof your Pokémon walking alongside you...[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_06_home_03	have you ever noticed changes in its coloration?[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_06_home_04	Now I don’t mean that it suddenly becomes a\nShiny Pokémon or any nonsense like that.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_06_home_05	I am speaking of it becoming filthy![VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_06_home_06	Pokémon battle! They get hurt by moves used\nagainst them![VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_06_home_07	They get battered by wind and rain! They get\ncovered in sand and mud![VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_06_home_08	They get, in a word, filthy![VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_06_home_09	I have seen many a Trainer walking about with\ntheir adorable little Pokémon without addressing\r\nthis issue. It is deplorable.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_06_home_10	Let me ask this question of someone who I am\nsure would not tolerate such shameful conduct.\r\nAh yes, M[VAR 1100(00FF,0305)]asteriss [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_06_home_11	What should you do if your Pokémon is dirty?[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_06_select_01	Clean it up
class_g_06_select_02	Pat it on the head
class_g_06_select_03	Nothing
class_g_06_home_answer_01	Perfectly correct! I knew I could count on you to\nprovide me with such an answer.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_06_home_answer_02	While patting your Pokémon on the head to\nexpress appreciation for its hard work would\r\nmake for an adorable moment, that would not\r\nclean it of its filth![VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_06_home_answer_03	I suppose, in time, filth accumulated from rain\nand mud may well fall of its own accord...but I\r\nnever expected such an answer from you.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_06_home_12	When your Pokémon are dirty, clean them!\nThis is, of course, simply common sense.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_06_home_13	While you are having a picnic, you can approach\nthe Pokémon on your team and perform a\r\nvariety of actions.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_06_home_14	One such action is putting them through what I\nlike to call the “Pokémon Wash”... In other words,\r\nyou are able to clean them up![VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_06_home_15	You start by getting your sponge lathered up with\nsoapy bubbles as you gently and carefully scrub\r\nyour Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_06_home_16	Once your Pokémon is nice and covered in\nsoapy bubbles...[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_06_home_17	the bubbles will encapsulate the filth, then you\nsimply wash it away with a spray of water![VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_06_home_18	This will get your Pokémon clean and shining\nbright as a Tera Jewel![VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_06_home_19	It is certainly quite a bit of work, but this will\nalso restore HP and cure status conditions.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_06_home_20	However, some Pokémon may have parts of their\nbodies that they don’t want scrubbed or that\r\nthey would rather not get wet.\c\nBe sure to keep this in mind when cleaning your\nPokémon.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_06_home_21	Now, the most important point that I must\nmention is that some Pokémon LIKE to be dirty.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_06_home_22	Though I will contradict myself by saying this,\nplease do remember that cleaning your Pokémon\r\nis not always the kind thing to do.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_06_home_23	Our time together has come to an end for today.\nI bid you all farewell.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_07.dat
class_g_07_home_01	Put away your phones. It is time to begin our last\nclass together.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_07_home_02	Home economics is the study of life’s necessities,\nbut looking back on our time together, I realize\r\nthat I focused almost entirely on food.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_07_home_03	I hope it is not too late to shift to a discussion of\nclothing—another necessity—in our last class.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_07_home_04	As I’m sure you are aware, our academy has an\nair of freedom about it.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_07_home_05	We provide uniforms for each season to\naccommodate the diverse climate of Paldea.\c\nHowever, students are free to wear whichever\nstyle they wish whenever they please.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_07_home_06	You should all have received four sets of tops\nand bottoms—one each for spring, summer, fall,\r\nand winter—when the academy accepted you.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_07_home_07	If, by chance, you were not aware of this, you\nmay wish to peruse your wardrobe.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_07_home_08	As long as you wear our school uniform, the rest\nof your ensemble need not be school-issued.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_07_home_09	This includes your bag or your hat, if you choose\nto wear one. You are even free to style your hair\r\nhowever you wish.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_07_home_10	Mr. Salvatore’s hairstyle, for example, would\nalmost certainly have been against school rules\r\nwhen I was a boy.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_07_home_11	That reminds me...[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_07_home_12	There is one more thing you all like to decorate,\nwhich—I must say—I find quite charming.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_07_select_01	Our classroom desks?
class_g_07_select_02	Our dorm rooms?
class_g_07_select_03	Our Rotom Phones?
class_g_07_home_answer_01	No, not that. I speak of something smaller and far\nmore adorable...\c\nMore importantly, your desk is not different or\ncustomized in the slightest![VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_07_home_answer_02	No, not that. I speak of something smaller and far\nmore adorable...\c\nMore importantly, how you decorate the interior\nof your dorm rooms is none of my business![VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_07_home_answer_03	Perfectly correct! That’s the adorable little thing\nI was speaking of! Ohhh, it interests me so![VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_07_home_13	I must admit that I am fascinated by Rotom\nPhones and how to customize them![VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_07_home_14	What’s that...? How very intriguing!\c\nSo there’s a shop called Delibird Presents, where\nyou can purchase cases for your Rotom Phones![VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_07_home_15	I thank you for that useful bit of information...[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_07_home_16	I shall have to go myself first thing tomorrow to\nget an adorable case of my own liking.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_07_home_17	Forgive me... I seem to have gotten a little\ncarried away with this small talk.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_07_home_18	Ahem. As this class known as home economics\nnears its end, I offer these final words to you who\r\nhave been honing everyday life skills with me.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_07_home_19	My field of study is not so decisive as the likes\nof mathematics, for instance, where test scores\r\nmight play a part in deciding your future.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_07_home_20	However, as you go on to cook for yourselves,\nto take care of your Pokémon, to decide what to\r\nwear in the morning when you awaken...[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_07_home_21	I would be honored if what I have taught you\nserves to smoothen out and enrich your lives,\r\neven if only a little.\c\nThis sentiment was imparted to me by Mr. Hassel\nand his particular outlook on such matters.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_07_home_22	I thank you all from the bottom of my heart for\nseeing this class through to the end.[VAR 0114(0029)]
class_g_07_home_23	Our time together has come to a close for today.\nPrepare to do your best on our final exam.[VAR 0114(0029)]

common_0210_pokecen_04	It’s your ticket to making TMs, which you can use\nto teach moves to your Pokémon.

gym_esper_040_esper_06b	[~]

gym_esper_040_esper_17	Don’t go uploading that selfie we just took to\nsocial media, OK?[VAR 0114(001C)]
gym_esper_040_esper_15	I think my makeup has run a little with all the\nmoving and sweating I did during our battle.[VAR 0114(001C)]

kitakami_center_before_01_01	Welcome to Kitakami Hall! Not long now before\nthe big festival starts again!
kitakami_center_before_08_01	Snorlax is known as the Sleeping Pokémon, eh?\nPretty clear where that category comes from!
kitakami_center_before_12_01	We’ve got a real fun game in the works for you.\nCome on by once the Festival of Masks starts!
kitakami_center_after_01_01	Good kids, bad kids, kids at heart—Kitakami Hall\nwelcomes one and all to the Festival of Masks!
kitakami_center_after_01_02	I just saw someone run upstairs wearing a Loyal\nThree costume. They must be sweltering in there!
kitakami_center_after_01_03	Wait, so that thing I saw before really WAS one\nof the Loyal Three? I knew I should’ve filmed it!
kitakami_center_after_09_01	I want to buy a mask, but no one’s at the stall!
kitakami_center_after_09_02	They opened the stall back up! I should be able\nto buy a mask now.
kitakami_center_after_10_01	So many masks! Which one should I choose?
kitakami_center_after_10_02	With a Pikachu mask, you’ll have a pika-pika day!
kitakami_center_after_16_01	Fanning cools me down, but flapping my arm like\nthis makes me hot and sweaty all over again...
kitakami_center_after_20_01	Every year, masks of the Loyal Three are the first\nthings to fly off the shelves!
kitakami_center_after_20_02	Is it true that the Loyal Three came back to life?\c\nMaybe if I wear one of their masks, get close to\nthem—even get to know them...
kitakami_center_after_20_03	The real Fezandipiti wasn’t as pink as I thought it\nwould be... What’s the OPPOSITE of serendipity?
kitakami_center_after_21_01	Munkidori’s mask is so awesome and blue!
kitakami_center_after_21_02	Wait, the Loyal Three really exist? All this time I\nthought it was just an old folktale...
kitakami_center_after_21_03	The real Munkidori’s blue coloring was so...sickly.\nI hope it’s feeling hunky-dory...
kitakami_center_after_22_01	When I put on a mask, I feel like I’ve become an\nentirely different me!
kitakami_center_after_22_02	I always thought the ogre was nothing more than\na tall tale the adults spun up to make kids listen!
kitakami_center_after_22_03	Okidogi was a bad guy? That’s not okeydokey\nat all!
kitakami_center_after_25_01	That human depicted on the old signboards...\nI wonder if that’s the Loyal Three’s Trainer.
kitakami_center_after_31_01	Step right on up for a round of Ogre Oustin’!\nHave a go and win some wonderful prizes!
kitakami_center_after_55_01	You’ll need to ride a Pokémon if you want to\nhave a go at Ogre Oustin’!\c\nBut don’t worry—we’ve got a Stantler right here\nfor folks without a ridable Pokémon of their own!
kizuna_battle_a.dat
kizuna_battle_a_01	Osu, new kid![VAR 0114(0024)]
kizuna_battle_a_02	Have you come out here to the schoolyard for\nsome training?![VAR 0114(0024)]
kizuna_battle_a_03a	Aha! I knew I could see a fighting spirit burning\nbehind those eyes of yours![VAR 0114(0024)]
kizuna_battle_a_03b	Ah! Sorry. That was a little rude of me to ask.\nI know the point of training isn’t to show off in\r\nfront of other people.[VAR 0114(0024)]
kizuna_battle_a_04	Why don’t we do a bit of running together here\nto get to know each other a little better?[VAR 0114(0024)]
kizuna_battle_a_05	Ready? Let’s go![VAR 0114(0024)]
kizuna_battle_a_system_01	You ran three laps around the schoolyard with\nMs. Dendra...
kizuna_battle_a_06	Phew! That really worked up a nice sweat![VAR 0114(0024)]
kizuna_battle_a_07	You’ve got a good pair of legs on ya, new kid![VAR 0114(0024)]
kizuna_battle_a_08	A good bout of training sure does make a body\nhungry, doesn’t it?[VAR 0114(0024)]
kizuna_battle_a_09	I’ll let you have one of my homemade\nsandwiches as my way of saying thanks for\r\nrunning with me today! Feed those muscles![VAR 0114(0024)]
kizuna_battle_a_system_02	Ms. Dendra’s sandwich was dry and had an odd\nsmell. The taste left much to be desired...
kizuna_battle_a_10	How was it? I hope it was tasty.[VAR 0114(0024)]
kizuna_battle_a_select_01	Uh, yeah, tasty...
kizuna_battle_a_select_02	Well, to be honest...
kizuna_battle_a_11	Sorry. I shouldn’t have asked you that. Heh...[VAR 0114(0024)]
kizuna_battle_a_12	I’m athletic and all, but I don’t know the first\nthing about making good food...[VAR 0114(0024)]
kizuna_battle_a_13	as your honest reaction just reminded me.[VAR 0114(0024)]
kizuna_battle_a_14	Well, uh...see you later. Enjoy your sore muscles\ntomorrow.[VAR 0114(0024)]
kizuna_battle_a_system_03	You became slightly closer with Ms. Dendra!
kizuna_battle_b.dat
kizuna_battle_b_01	Osu, new kid![VAR 0114(0024)]
kizuna_battle_b_02	Fancy meeting you here in the home economics\nclassroom! What a coincidence, eh?[VAR 0114(0024)]
kizuna_battle_b_select_01	Likewise!
kizuna_battle_b_select_02	What brings you here?
kizuna_battle_b_03	So, uh...well, y’see...[VAR 0114(0024)]
kizuna_battle_b_home_01	Ms. Dendra tells me she is here for intensive\ntraining in sandwich making.[VAR 0114(0029)]
kizuna_battle_b_04	Aww. Well, no use hiding it now...[VAR 0114(0024)]
kizuna_battle_b_home_02	Oh dear. I’m terribly sorry. Were you keeping this\na secret?[VAR 0114(0029)]
kizuna_battle_b_05	Well, I mean, not really...but it just doesn’t look\nvery cool to openly admit I’m here for “intensive\r\ntraining.” Y’know?[VAR 0114(0024)]
kizuna_battle_b_home_03	Understood. I will be more careful in the future.[VAR 0114(0029)]
kizuna_battle_b_06	Well, new kid, now that you know what I’m\nup to...[VAR 0114(0024)]
kizuna_battle_b_07	I guess you’ll just have to help me out with my\ntraining here![VAR 0114(0024)]
kizuna_battle_b_08	Try this sandwich! It’s the result of my training\nso far.[VAR 0114(0024)]
kizuna_battle_b_system_02	Ms. Dendra’s sandwich was soggy and hard to\neat. And, once again, the taste left much to be\r\ndesired...
kizuna_battle_b_09	That was my meat lover’s prosciutto, bacon, and\nchorizo sandwich! How was it?[VAR 0114(0024)]
kizuna_battle_b_select_03	It was, uh, a little meat heavy...
kizuna_battle_b_select_04	It could have used some more veggies...
kizuna_battle_b_10	What?! You mean there was a problem with my\nchoice of filling?[VAR 0114(0024)]
kizuna_battle_b_11	I guess focusing on muscle-building ingredients\nreally did a number on the flavor, huh...[VAR 0114(0024)]
kizuna_battle_b_home_04	Ms. Dendra, I believe a simple addition of butter\nwould have done wonders for your sandwich.[VAR 0114(0029)]
kizuna_battle_b_home_05	Butter helps to protect the bread from getting\nsoggy due to the moisture of the ingredients.\r\nIt can also work to enhance the sandwich’s flavor.[VAR 0114(0029)]
kizuna_battle_b_12	Butter! That makes sense! Thank you for teaching\nme that tip, Mr. Saguaro![VAR 0114(0024)]
kizuna_battle_b_13	But why didn’t you tell me that while I was\nmaking the sandwich?[VAR 0114(0024)]
kizuna_battle_b_home_06	Ah...well, you see...when I saw you, I had not\nrealized you had begun your, ahem, food prep.\c\nI thought you were simply trying to destroy\nmy classroom.[VAR 0114(0029)]
kizuna_battle_b_14	... ... ...[VAR 0114(0024)]
kizuna_battle_b_15	Well, anyway![VAR 0114(0024)]
kizuna_battle_b_16	New kid! Thanks to you and Mr. Saguaro here,\nI may finally be getting the hang of this![VAR 0114(0024)]
kizuna_battle_b_17	Thanks for your advice![VAR 0114(0024)]
kizuna_battle_b_system_01	You became even closer with Ms. Dendra!
kizuna_battle_c.dat
kizuna_battle_c_health_01	No way. No way! NO WAY![VAR 0114(0028)]
kizuna_battle_c_01	C’mon, Miriam! Just try it![VAR 0114(0024)]
kizuna_battle_c_select_01	Ms. Dendra!
kizuna_battle_c_select_02	What’s wrong?
kizuna_battle_c_02	Oh! Great timing, new kid![VAR 0114(0024)]
kizuna_battle_c_03	Nurse Miriam here won’t try the sandwich I made![VAR 0114(0024)]
kizuna_battle_c_health_02	Well, DUH! I don’t want to get a stomachache![VAR 0114(0028)]
kizuna_battle_c_04	You won’t! Probably![VAR 0114(0024)]
kizuna_battle_c_health_03	Uh, I still remember that “sandwich” you made\nme with meat filling and meat for bread.\r\nThat one really messed me up bad.[VAR 0114(0028)]
kizuna_battle_c_05	I hadn’t trained in the art of sandwich making yet\nback then! I was young and thoughtless and—[VAR 0114(0024)]
kizuna_battle_c_health_04	“Young and thoughtless”? It was LAST MONTH![VAR 0114(0028)]
kizuna_battle_c_06	Sooo, as you can see, I’m not getting anywhere\ntrying to persuade her.[VAR 0114(0024)]
kizuna_battle_c_07	Even after I went through that intensive sandwich-\nmaking training! It kinda makes me sad...[VAR 0114(0024)]
kizuna_battle_c_health_05	She went through intensive sandwich-making\ntraining?[VAR 0114(0028)]
kizuna_battle_c_select_03	She worked really hard at it!
kizuna_battle_c_select_04	You should try her sandwich
kizuna_battle_c_health_06	Ugh...[VAR 0114(0028)]
kizuna_battle_c_health_07	I guess I have no choice if you’ve got one of our\ncute little students on your side.[VAR 0114(0028)]
kizuna_battle_c_health_08	So, fine. I’ll try your sandwich. Let’s see it.[VAR 0114(0028)]
kizuna_battle_c_08	Yesss! I knew you’d come around. Here it is...[VAR 0114(0024)]
kizuna_battle_c_health_09	*munch munch munch*[VAR 0114(0028)]
kizuna_battle_c_health_10	It’s a little strongly flavored, but...I guess it’s\nnot bad?[VAR 0114(0028)]
kizuna_battle_c_09	Woo-hoo! My training paid off![VAR 0114(0024)]
kizuna_battle_c_10	I’m so glad my sandwich pleases the great\nNurse Miriam! I look up to you, you know![VAR 0114(0024)]
kizuna_battle_c_system_01	You feel trusted by Ms. Dendra!
kizuna_battle_c_11	Thank you for trying it! And thanks to you too,\nnew kid![VAR 0114(0024)]
kizuna_battle_c_health_11	Aaand she’s run off again. That was weird...[VAR 0114(0028)]
kizuna_battle_c_health_12	But that’s just how Ms. Dendra is, I guess. She’s\nalways coming into the nurse’s office with some\r\ninjury or another, too.[VAR 0114(0028)]
kizuna_battle_d.dat
kizuna_battle_d_01	Osu, new kid! You here to do a little shopping?[VAR 0114(0024)]
kizuna_battle_d_select_01	Yep! I’m here to shop
kizuna_battle_d_select_02	I came to see you
kizuna_battle_d_02a	The school store’s a nice place! They’ve got\neverything you need right here![VAR 0114(0024)]
kizuna_battle_d_02b	Hahaha! So you came to see me, did you?[VAR 0114(0024)]
kizuna_battle_d_03	I’m here to check out the sandwiches they’ve got\nfor sale.[VAR 0114(0024)]
kizuna_battle_d_04	The school store’s sandwiches taste great and\nhave excellent nutritional balance, too![VAR 0114(0024)]
kizuna_battle_d_select_03	You’re not making your own?
kizuna_battle_d_select_04	What happened to your intensive training?
kizuna_battle_d_05	Haha. I guess I’m just not used to it yet. All that\ntraining kind of wore me out![VAR 0114(0024)]
kizuna_battle_d_06	I achieved my goal, anyway, so I’m going to take\na break from sandwich making for a bit![VAR 0114(0024)]
kizuna_battle_d_07	Oh, right. I didn’t tell you what my goal was.\c\nI wanted to pay Nurse Miriam back for everything\nshe does for me. It was my way of saying thanks![VAR 0114(0024)]
kizuna_battle_d_08	She’s so nice and so skilled at what she does.\nI really look up to her![VAR 0114(0024)]
kizuna_battle_d_09	I wanted to try sandwich making so I could be\nskilled at doing something for other people, like\r\nshe is, but I guess I just wasn’t cut out for it.[VAR 0114(0024)]
kizuna_battle_d_10	What I am cut out for, though, is being full of\nenergy! So I decided to focus on that instead![VAR 0114(0024)]
kizuna_battle_d_11	Like I said in class, I think people and Pokémon\nshould make their strong points stronger![VAR 0114(0024)]
kizuna_battle_d_12	You really helped me out, new kid! Take this as\nmy way of saying thanks.[VAR 0114(0024)]
kizuna_battle_d_13	All right, then! What should I go with today to\nget my protein in?[VAR 0114(0024)]
kizuna_battle_d_system_01	You formed a close bond with Ms. Dendra!

kizuna_botan_a_select_04	A little context, please?
kizuna_botan_a_07	Ah. Sorry. Your jump scare earlier completely\nfrazzled me. My brain’s still trying to reboot.[VAR 0114(0008)]
kizuna_botan_a_08	All right, here’s the sitch. Team Star’ve started\ncoming to school again...[VAR 0114(0008)]
kizuna_botan_a_09	But I don’t know if they’re gonna fit in OK, and\nit’s been playing on my mind, you know?\r\nSo I’m checking on them from over here...[VAR 0114(0008)]

kizuna_history_b_04	Don’t lie to me. Your desire to fulfill your\nintellectual curiosity is made plain as day by that\r\nlook on your face.[VAR 0114(0027)]
kizuna_history_b_05	A vessel, a sword, a set of tablets, and a set of\nbeads... After obtaining these four treasures, the\r\nking’s castle was destroyed. Why, you ask?[VAR 0114(0027)]
kizuna_history_b_06	Because these four treasures were actually\nfour Pokémon![VAR 0114(0027)]
kizuna_history_b_07	As these Pokémon were passed from human hand\nto human hand as treasures, they slowly became\r\ntainted by hubris and greed.[VAR 0114(0027)]
kizuna_history_b_08	Finally, after coming in contact with the rapacity\nof the king at that time, they awakened as\r\ndisasters and began to rampage out of control.[VAR 0114(0027)]
kizuna_history_b_09	The king called for renowned Pokémon wielders\nto defend the country and, after a fierce battle,\r\nthese incarnations of disaster were quelled.[VAR 0114(0027)]

kizuna_history_b_12	What?! Where’s your sense of adventure?[VAR 0114(0027)]
kizuna_history_b_13	Heh...very astute of you.[VAR 0114(0027)]

kizuna_history_c_04	And I stumbled upon the truth in the newspaper,\nof all places! Hah! In an interview piece with a\r\ncarpenter, no less![VAR 0114(0027)]
kizuna_history_c_05	The Pokémon wielders apparently used sacred\nstakes to seal these treasures of ruin in shrines.[VAR 0114(0027)]
kizuna_history_c_06	There is a separate shrine for each of the four\nPokémon, and eight stakes driven into the ground\r\nin the areas surrounding each shrine keep the\r\npower of ruin at bay.[VAR 0114(0027)]
kizuna_history_c_07	In other words, if all of the stakes for a given\nshrine were to be removed...[VAR 0114(0027)]
kizuna_history_c_08	it would release the Pokémon held inside![VAR 0114(0027)]
kizuna_history_c_09	Don’t you think it would be nice to free those\nPokémon from the confines of their tiny little\r\nshrines, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0027)]

kizuna_history_c_11	That’s surprisingly heartless of you! Come now—\ndo it for the Pokémon![VAR 0114(0027)]
kizuna_history_c_12	According to a descendant of the Pokémon\nwielders in the story, you must have a bond with\r\nPokémon in order to remove the stakes.[VAR 0114(0027)]
kizuna_history_c_13	I’m sure someone as Pokémon savvy as yourself\nwould have no trouble at all with that.[VAR 0114(0027)]

kizuna_history_d_03	Hm? It seems to me that you don’t have anything\nnew to report on the treasures of ruin...[VAR 0114(0027)]
kizuna_history_d_04a	Oh! You caught Ting-Lu, the Vessel of Ruin?[VAR 0114(0027)]
kizuna_history_d_04b	Oh! You caught Chien-Pao, the Sword of Ruin?[VAR 0114(0027)]

kizuna_history_d_04d	Oh! You caught Chi-Yu, the Beads of Ruin?[VAR 0114(0027)]
kizuna_history_d_05	Ohohooo! How interesting! I simply cannot keep\nmy curiosity under control![VAR 0114(0027)]
kizuna_history_d_06a	Judging by its shape and size, this vessel was\nalmost certainly NOT for everyday use.[VAR 0114(0027)]
kizuna_history_d_07a	Perhaps it was a work of art? Or, better yet, a\nritual artifact housing some sort of deity?![VAR 0114(0027)]
kizuna_history_d_08a	I feel that there must be some meaning behind\nthe horns and the designs resembling eyes.[VAR 0114(0027)]
kizuna_history_d_09a	Could it be that this artifact was fashioned after\nthe deity’s very appearance?![VAR 0114(0027)]
kizuna_history_d_06b	So the sword’s blade and hilt form the Pokémon’s\nleft and right fangs![VAR 0114(0027)]
kizuna_history_d_07b	I wonder if the sword broke when it became a\nPokémon... Or perhaps it was always that way?[VAR 0114(0027)]
kizuna_history_d_08b	No, wait—I cannot imagine the king wanting to\nbuy a broken sword.[VAR 0114(0027)]
kizuna_history_d_09b	Maybe it was some sort of weapon that was\nmeant to be used in this “broken” state?![VAR 0114(0027)]
kizuna_history_d_06c	I’ve never seen so many wooden writing tablets\nstrung together! It must have been an epic tale![VAR 0114(0027)]
kizuna_history_d_07c	Most excavated tablets are tantamount to graffiti\nor simple memos—still valuable tools for learning\r\nabout the past, but nothing like this![VAR 0114(0027)]
kizuna_history_d_08c	I can’t read it, but given the length...it must be\na story, yes! Or perhaps the words of a curse...?[VAR 0114(0027)]
kizuna_history_d_09c	If only the words weren’t faded! How frustrating!\nThese wooden tablets piqued the curiosity of a\r\nking! What might have been written on them?[VAR 0114(0027)]
kizuna_history_d_06d	Beads like these were thought to be sacred and\nthus were worn during religious rituals.[VAR 0114(0027)]
kizuna_history_d_07d	I believe they were most often worn as a single\nbead on the neck like a pendant, but it seems\r\nChi-Yu has four of them.[VAR 0114(0027)]
kizuna_history_d_08d	Were the beads worn in pairs, like on the ears\nand wrists? Or were the rituals perhaps\r\nperformed by four people?[VAR 0114(0027)]
kizuna_history_d_09d	What on earth could have caused beads such as\nthese—originally used to ward off disaster—to\r\nbecome bringers of disaster themselves?[VAR 0114(0027)]

kizuna_language_b_06	This’ll fix you right up, my friend! Potion\npower, GO![VAR 0114(0026)]
kizuna_language_b_poke_01	... ... ...
kizuna_language_b_07	Phew. That seems to have done the trick just in\nthe nick of time![VAR 0114(0026)]
kizuna_language_b_08	But this Pawmi doesn’t appear to belong to a\nTrainer. Hmm... Could a wild Pokémon have\r\nwandered onto the academy grounds?[VAR 0114(0026)]
kizuna_language_b_09	Still, I can’t just leave it here alone without\nanyone to make sure it’s OK.[VAR 0114(0026)]
kizuna_language_b_10	It’s decided, then! I, Salvatore, will just have to\nlend all of the helping hands I have to take care\r\nof Pawmi in this touch-and-go situation![VAR 0114(0026)]
kizuna_language_b_11	[VAR BD06(0000)]Merci very much for your advice,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0026)]

kizuna_language_c_01	Oh! My dear [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0026)]
kizuna_language_c_02	Thanks to your advice from before, Pawmi is...\nWell, just see for yourself![VAR 0114(0026)]
kizuna_language_c_poke_01	... ... ...
kizuna_language_c_select_01	Is it feeling better now?
kizuna_language_c_select_02	It seems very...quiet?
kizuna_language_c_03	Hmm...yeah. It’s feeling better, but this particular\nPawmi may just be a bit meek, I suppose?[VAR 0114(0026)]
kizuna_language_c_ecology_01	I had Nurse Miriam take a look as well, and she\nsays there’s nothing wrong with it healthwise![VAR 0114(002A)]
kizuna_language_c_ecology_02	So it shouldn’t have any injuries, ailments, or\nthe like.[VAR 0114(002A)]
kizuna_language_c_poke_02	... ... ...
kizuna_language_c_04	Even so, it never utters so much as a cry, which\nis odd.[VAR 0114(0026)]
kizuna_language_c_05	That part has even Mr. Jacq here stumped.[VAR 0114(0026)]
kizuna_language_c_ecology_03	Sorry that I couldn’t be of any help...[VAR 0114(002A)]
kizuna_language_c_06	Ne t’inquiète pas! Don’t worry about it![VAR 0114(0026)]
kizuna_language_c_07	I have some more information now thanks to the\nacademy’s security cameras, though.[VAR 0114(0026)]
kizuna_language_c_08	It seems Pawmi was attacked by a wild Pokémon\nand fled here to the academy grounds.[VAR 0114(0026)]
kizuna_language_c_09	Maybe it’s still in a bit of shock from that\nexperience and can’t bring itself to speak yet?[VAR 0114(0026)]
kizuna_language_c_poke_03	... ... ...
kizuna_language_c_10	Yep! If that’s the case, there’s absolutely no\nproblem with keeping quiet! Pas de problème![VAR 0114(0026)]
kizuna_language_c_11	We can just attendre—wait, that is—until it feels\nlike talking! That’s all we can do, really![VAR 0114(0026)]
kizuna_language_c_12	Even if you can speak all sorts of languages,\nthere’s no guarantee that you can understand\r\nwhat’s going on in someone’s heart.[VAR 0114(0026)]
kizuna_language_c_13	But have no fear! I won’t give up! No—I’ll keep\non trying until we’ve figured each other out![VAR 0114(0026)]
kizuna_language_c_system_01	You feel trusted by Mr. Salvatore!

kizuna_language_d_01	My dear [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0026)]
kizuna_language_d_02	Pawmi here is as healthy as can be![VAR 0114(0026)]
kizuna_language_d_poke_01	... ... ...
kizuna_language_d_03	Hahaha! Well, it seems being quiet is simply a\npart of this one’s personality![VAR 0114(0026)]
kizuna_language_d_04	But it’s hard for a Pokémon to communicate with\nits fellows without speaking up.[VAR 0114(0026)]
kizuna_language_d_05	As you know, wild Pokémon use their cries to tell\neach other all sorts of things—like the location of\r\nfood or whether there are predators nearby.[VAR 0114(0026)]
kizuna_language_d_06	So even if I were to release it back into the wild,\nI’m afraid that it may not be able to do those\r\nsorts of things![VAR 0114(0026)]
kizuna_language_d_poke_02	... ... ...
kizuna_language_d_07	[VAR BD06(0000)]What do you think, [VAR 0100(0000)]?\nWhere\r\ndoes\r\nPawmi belong?[VAR 0114(0026)]
kizuna_language_d_select_01	How about here?
kizuna_language_d_select_02	With you, Mr. Salvatore!
kizuna_language_d_08a	Here? At the academy?[VAR 0114(0026)]
kizuna_language_d_08b	Oh?! I didn’t expect to hear mon nom—my name![VAR 0114(0026)]
kizuna_language_d_09	So you think it should stay here...with me![VAR 0114(0026)]
kizuna_language_d_10	I was so focused on getting it back in good\nhealth so it could return to the wild that I didn’t\r\neven consider that possibility![VAR 0114(0026)]
kizuna_language_d_11	What do you think about that idea, my little\nPawmi friend?[VAR 0114(0026)]
kizuna_language_d_poke_03	... ... ...
kizuna_language_d_poke_04	Pawmi!
kizuna_language_d_12	Pawmi! It spoke! At last![VAR 0114(0026)]
kizuna_language_d_13	Even without speaking Pokémon language myself,\nI know that that reply means “yes”![VAR 0114(0026)]
kizuna_language_d_14	[VAR BD06(0000)]Oh, my dear [VAR 0100(0000)]! Merci\nso\r\nvery,\r\nvery\r\nmuch\r\nfor\r\nall\r\nyour\r\nhelp\r\nwith Pawmi![VAR 0114(0026)]
kizuna_language_d_16	All the more reason you should have this—here,\na rare Pokémon for you to raise![VAR 0114(0026)]
kizuna_language_d_system_02	You received a Meowth from Mr. Salvatore!
kizuna_language_d_15	Ahhh, I’m so happy! Yes—I, Salvatore, will take\nit upon myself to look after Pawmi for good!\r\nI will indeed![VAR 0114(0026)]

kizuna_math_a_select_04	Yes, I have a question!
kizuna_math_a_select_05	All good! No questions!
kizuna_math_a_05	What were you having trouble with? Let’s have a\nlittle review here, shall we?[VAR 0114(0025)]
kizuna_math_a_06	Hahaha. I’m glad to hear it! Then perhaps you\nwon’t mind a little quiz.[VAR 0114(0025)]
kizuna_math_a_07	Flying-type Pokémon are weak to Rock-type\nmoves.\c\nWhen a Rock-type move hits a Flying-type\nPokémon, what becomes of the move’s damage?[VAR 0114(0025)]
kizuna_math_a_select_01	It stays the same
kizuna_math_a_select_02	It’s doubled
kizuna_math_a_select_03	It’s multiplied by 100
kizuna_math_a_08a	Yes, that’s right! The correct answer is that the\nmove’s damage is doubled.[VAR 0114(0025)]
kizuna_math_a_08b	Oh dear. The correct answer is that the move’s\ndamage is doubled. But I appreciate you trying![VAR 0114(0025)]

kizuna_math_a_09	Oh, my. I see one of my more energetic students\nis here to see me. You’ll have to wait your turn,\r\ndear! There is only one of me, after all.[VAR 0114(0025)]
kizuna_math_a_mob_02	Um, Ms. Tyme? Is it true that you were a Gym\nLeader?!
kizuna_math_a_10	That is indeed true. I’m quite the strong battler,\nyou know![VAR 0114(0025)]
kizuna_math_a_mob_03	Wow! That’s so cool! Why’d you quit?
kizuna_math_a_11	So you want to know, do you? I might be\npersuaded to tell you if you wait your turn.[VAR 0114(0025)]
kizuna_math_a_mob_04	OK! I can wait my turn! I sure can!

kizuna_math_b_03	Please forgive me if this is an...odd question.[VAR 0114(0025)]
kizuna_math_b_04	Were you perhaps watching me from afar\njust now?[VAR 0114(0025)]
kizuna_math_b_select_01	No, I wasn’t
kizuna_math_b_select_02	I just got here
kizuna_math_b_05	Y-yes, I suppose you wouldn’t have been doing\nsomething like that. I’m sorry.[VAR 0114(0025)]
kizuna_math_b_06	You see... Oh, how should I put this?[VAR 0114(0025)]
kizuna_math_b_07	Recently, there have been times when I feel as if\nI am being watched...[VAR 0114(0025)]
kizuna_math_b_08	Not by a Pokémon, mind you, but by a person.[VAR 0114(0025)]
kizuna_math_b_09	I thought it might be a ghost, so I tried asking my\nsister for help. She said it most likely isn’t one.\r\nShe’s good with Ghost-type Pokémon, you know.[VAR 0114(0025)]
kizuna_math_b_10	Perhaps one of my students is quietly watching\nme, waiting for a chance to ask me a question?[VAR 0114(0025)]
kizuna_math_b_select_03	That might be it
kizuna_math_b_select_04	Hmmm. Maybe?
kizuna_math_b_11	Goodness, if that wasn’t an intense gaze I felt!\nIf you notice someone with a sort of fire in their\r\neyes, come tell me, won’t you?[VAR 0114(0025)]

kizuna_math_c_select_01	Are you here to eat?
kizuna_math_c_select_02	Were you cooking something?
kizuna_math_c_02	Oh, no! I’m not here for anything food-related\nat all![VAR 0114(0025)]
kizuna_math_c_03	I was just walking around the entrance hall...[VAR 0114(0025)]
kizuna_math_c_04	and I felt that intense gaze that I told you\nabout before![VAR 0114(0025)]
kizuna_math_c_05	So I quickly ducked into the cafeteria here.[VAR 0114(0025)]
kizuna_math_c_06	Our cafeteria has only one entrance, so I thought\nI might be able to discover the identity of the\r\nperson watching me if they followed me in here![VAR 0114(0025)]
kizuna_math_c_07	Ah! Someone’s come just now![VAR 0114(0025)]
kizuna_math_c_woman_01	Huh? That’s weird...I thought I saw her come\nin here.
kizuna_math_c_woman_02	I guess I won’t be able to ask my question today,\neither...
kizuna_math_c_08	That girl...I feel like I’ve seen her several times\nbefore.[VAR 0114(0025)]
kizuna_math_c_09	She seems to be a student here, but I get the\nfeeling that her question is not about her studies.[VAR 0114(0025)]
kizuna_math_c_10	Next time I see her, maybe I’ll go start up a\nconversation myself![VAR 0114(0025)]
kizuna_math_c_11	It could have been a little scary being here on my\nown. I’m glad you were here with me.[VAR 0114(0025)]

kizuna_math_d_woman_04	I’ve been a huge fan of yours since your time as\na Gym Leader! And I love Rock-type moves so\r\nvery much!
kizuna_math_d_08	Oh, my...[VAR 0114(0025)]
kizuna_math_d_woman_05	But you just suddenly retired from your post as\nGym Leader a year and a half ago...\c\nWhy did you quit?!
kizuna_math_d_09	My goodness... Is that all you wanted to ask?[VAR 0114(0025)]
kizuna_math_d_woman_06	Yes. Your reason for retiring was never\nmade public...
kizuna_math_d_woman_07	but it’s well known among the students here that\nyou just avoid the question any time it’s asked.
kizuna_math_d_woman_08	I thought it would be rude to ask you a question\nthat you don’t want to answer...so I just couldn’t\r\nfind the courage to ask.
kizuna_math_d_10	So that’s why your gaze felt so very intense. I see.\nForgive me.[VAR 0114(0025)]
kizuna_math_d_woman_09	So very...intense?
kizuna_math_d_11	Ah, never mind that. As for the reason I quit my\njob as Gym Leader, I simply wanted to focus\r\nmore on my job as a teacher.[VAR 0114(0025)]
kizuna_math_d_12	It’s not that I disliked being a Gym Leader or\nanything of that sort.[VAR 0114(0025)]
kizuna_math_d_13	Quite the contrary—talking about the Gym fills\nme with feelings of nostalgia and sadness.[VAR 0114(0025)]
kizuna_math_d_14	That’s why I always avoid answering the question\nwhen students ask.[VAR 0114(0025)]
kizuna_math_d_woman_10	Oh. I see...
kizuna_math_d_woman_11	Do you have any plans of becoming a Gym\nLeader again?
kizuna_math_d_15	No, I’m afraid I don’t plan to do so.[VAR 0114(0025)]
kizuna_math_d_16	My sister is doing a splendid job as Gym Leader\nin my stead.[VAR 0114(0025)]
kizuna_math_d_17	I personally find being a teacher most enjoyable\nthese days.[VAR 0114(0025)]
kizuna_math_d_18	But since I am, in fact, your teacher...I would\nappreciate it if you would call me “Ms. Tyme,”\r\nas students do, and not just “Tyme.”[VAR 0114(0025)]
kizuna_math_d_woman_12	OK. I’m sad to hear that, but I understand!
kizuna_math_d_woman_13	Thank you so much, Ms. Tyme!
kizuna_math_d_19	Well, I suppose that solves the mystery![VAR 0114(0025)]
kizuna_math_d_20	Ahhh, that made me so nervous! I said so many\nthings to try to sound cool![VAR 0114(0025)]
kizuna_math_d_21	I was certainly a little scared when I felt that girl’s\nintense gaze on me.[VAR 0114(0025)]
kizuna_math_d_22	But having you here with me allowed me to do\nwhat needed to be done to face what turned out\r\nto be one of my biggest fans.[VAR 0114(0025)]

kizuna_rival_c_04	I ran into him again in the entrance hall, so I\nasked him to battle...but he said no![VAR 0114(0004)]
kizuna_rival_c_05	He was like, “What’s the point? You’re a\nChampion and a battle whiz—you’d wreck me!”[VAR 0114(0004)]
kizuna_rival_c_06	I don’t get what he meant! I mean, you can have\nfun battling even if you lose, right?[VAR 0114(0004)]
kizuna_rival_c_select_01	Yeah, you can
kizuna_rival_c_select_02	Winning’s nice, though...
kizuna_rival_c_07a	For real! I mean, sure, no one loves losing, but\nit’s definitely not pointless. It teaches you stuff![VAR 0114(0004)]

legend_0010_friend_13	Basically, they’re some kind of special herbs that\nheal up any Pokémon as soon as it eats them![VAR 0114(0006)]
legend_0010_friend_14	Now, there are a total of five different types of\nHerba Mystica, based on what I read.\c\nJust taking a little lick of them once they’ve been\npowdered will get your blood flowing, provide\r\nnutrients, prevent aging—it’ll even boost the\r\nimmune system![VAR 0114(0006)]

legend_0010_friend_20	Nope! Wait! I don’t need an answer yet![VAR 0114(0006)]
legend_0010_friend_23	I’ll just register the places where it seems there\nmight be Titans in your map app for you.[VAR 0114(0006)]

msg_pokecen_kaifuku_hint_20b	I’d guess a fresh-faced student belongs in school!\c\nHead to Uva Academy, why don’t you? You must\nbe excited to join your class!
msg_pokecen_kaifuku_hint_21a	I’d guess there are still corners of the academy\nyou haven’t checked out.\c\nDon’t be afraid to visit different rooms—\nwho knows who you’ll end up meeting!
msg_pokecen_kaifuku_hint_21b	I’d guess there are still corners of the academy\nyou haven’t checked out.\c\nDon’t be afraid to go into different rooms—\nwho knows who you’ll end up meeting!
msg_pokecen_kaifuku_hint_00	...Nope! Sorry, I’ve got nothing!\c\nYou’re ready for anything Paldea could possibly\nthrow at you, so I’d say go wherever you’d like!
msg_pokecen_kaifuku_hint_01	You should pay a visit to the Cortondo Gym!\c\nHave you considered trying to take on Gym\nLeader Katy in charming Cortondo?
msg_pokecen_kaifuku_hint_02	I’d recommend the Artazon Gym!\c\nHave you thought about taking on Gym Leader\nBrassius? He’s in picturesque Artazon!

msg_pokecen_kaifuku_hint_04	I’d aim for the Levincia Gym!\c\nYou could try challenging Gym Leader Iono in\nthe dazzling city of Levincia!
msg_pokecen_kaifuku_hint_05	I think you’d better visit the Medali Gym!\c\nYou could try taking on Gym Leader Larry next.\nYou’ll find him in good old Medali.

msg_pokecen_kaifuku_hint_07	I think you should try the Montenevera Gym next.\c\nYou could try challenging Gym Leader Ryme\nin chilly Montenevera!
msg_pokecen_kaifuku_hint_08	I’d say, how about the Alfornada Gym?\c\nHave you considered taking on Gym Leader Tulip\nin scorching Alfornada?
msg_pokecen_kaifuku_hint_09	I’d say make for the lair of the Rock-type Titan!\c\nWhy not try to seek out the Pokémon known as\nthe Stony Cliff Titan?
msg_pokecen_kaifuku_hint_10	I’d say make for the lair of the Steel-type Titan!\c\nMaybe try seeking out the Pokémon known as\nthe Lurking Steel Titan?

msg_pokecen_kaifuku_hint_13	I’d say make for the lair of the Dragon-type Titan!\c\nWhy not seek out the Pokémon called the\nFalse Dragon Titan?
msg_pokecen_kaifuku_hint_14	It’d be the base of Team Star’s Fairy crew!\c\nOrtega, the boss of the Ruchbah Squad, would\nprobably welcome a challenge, from what I hear.

msg_pokecen_kaifuku_hint_16	It’d be the base of Team Star’s Fire crew!\c\nSeems like Mela, the boss of the Schedar Squad,\nis burning for someone to battle against.
msg_pokecen_kaifuku_hint_17	It’d be the base of Team Star’s Poison crew!\c\nAtticus, the boss of the Navi Squad, is apparently\nwaiting for someone to battle.

msg_common_gameover_pc_02_01_s1	You know, you’d better visit a Pokémon Center\nwhenever your Pokémon [VAR 1101(00FD,0302)]isare running low on HP.\c\nAnd you should stock up on, like, lotsa Potions\nand stuff at Peachy’s or wherever.
msg_common_gameover_pc_02_02_s1	Anyway, I healed up your Pokémon—all happy\nand healthy again.\c\nI’m glad they’re all OK. Be more careful out\nthere, would ya?

s1_side02_0000_camera_08	Hey, this might sound a bit weird, but would it\nbe all right if I took your photo?[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0000_camera_09	Just like that, huh? Are you always this open with\ntotal strangers? Kinda worried about you, kiddo![VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0000_camera_10	Anyway, let me snap that photo.[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0000_camera_11	So you know better than to put too much trust\nin a stranger you just met!\c\nGlad to see you’ve got a good head on those\nshoulders, kiddo![VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0000_camera_12	You’ve got a unique vibe, you know. I like it.\nIt’s a bit different than what I’m used to.[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0000_camera_13	I’m gonna be making this town my home base for\na little while.[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0000_camera_14	Why don’t you focus on wrapping up whatever\nyou’ve got going on for now?\c\nCome see me after, I dunno, registering 150\nPokémon in the Kitakami Pokédex or something![VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0000_camera_15	Kiddo. Look, I like your gung-ho style, but it\nseems to me like you’ve already got something\r\nyou need to do, don’t you?\c\nGo and catch 150 Pokémon for the Kitakami\nPokédex or something, like a good little student!\c\nCome gimme a holler AFTER you’ve done that—\nnot before.\c\nTime is money! Don’t go wasting it![VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0010.dat
s1_side02_0010_camera_01	Oh! Hey, kiddo! Wait, don’t tell me—[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0010_camera_02	You actually caught over 150 Pokémon from the\nKitakami Pokédex?!\c\nNow I KNOW you’re the real deal![VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0010_select_01	That’s right!
s1_side02_0010_select_02	It’s not that much...
s1_side02_0010_camera_03	Pretty impressive! You must really be something\nspecial, kiddo![VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0010_camera_04	Hahaha! No need to act modest, kiddo! You\nshould be proud![VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0010_camera_05	You probably know more about the Pokémon\nhere in Kitakami than I do—and I got here first![VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0010_camera_06	Which reminds me![VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0010_camera_07	I’ve got a favor to ask you, see. A real Pokémon-\ncatching pro like you is just what I need.[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0010_select_03	What kind of favor?
s1_side02_0010_select_04	Not interested...
s1_side02_0010_camera_08	Ooh, did I tickle your curiosity? Glad you don’t\nseem afraid to poke your head into new things!\r\nIn that case, let me tell you what I’m all about.[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0010_camera_09	Kiddo! Come ON! It’s important to take detours\nin life sometimes, don’t you know that?\c\nSo yeah, I’m just gonna tell you anyway.[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0010_camera_10	The reason I came here to Kitakami was actually\nto find a certain Pokémon...and photograph it.[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0010_camera_11	I’ve been searching on my own for ages, but I\nstill haven’t found it![VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0010_camera_12	So, kiddo...how about doing me a solid by\nhelping me with my search? I’d owe you forever![VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0010_camera_13	Rumor has it that the Pokémon I’m looking for\nis pretty ferociously strong.[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0010_camera_14	Just think! You could catch it and bring it along\non your adventures! Wouldn’t that be helpful?[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0010_camera_15	That enough to pique your interest? If so, I’ll\nneed you to prove you’re strong enough to help.[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0010_camera_16	If we’re really gonna partner up on this thing,\nthen I want to know you’re cut out for it.\c\nThat, and I want to get a good shot of you\nlooking all heroic and everything.[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0020.dat
s1_side02_0020_camera_01	OK, kiddo! Time for me to take a perfect shot—\nat your confidence, that is!\c\nReady to show me what you’ve got?[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0020_camera_02	Really? How about just a photo shoot, then?[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0020_camera_03	Yes! Then let’s just put a bit of distance between\nus—enough to keep my shots in focus...[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0020_camera_04	I’m not so strong, but don’t hold back! And don’t\nmind me snapping a few shots while we’re at it![VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0020_camera_05	You’re something, all right. I got a buncha good\nshots of you in action, too.[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0020_camera_06	I think you just might have what it takes to hold\nyour own against the [VAR FF00(0006)]Bloodmoon Beast[VAR FF00(0000)].[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0020_select_01	The Bloodmoon Beast?
s1_side02_0020_select_02	Is that the Pokémon you’re after?
s1_side02_0020_camera_07	Yeah. There’s a certain Ursaluna I’ve been\nsearching for...\c\nIt’s known as the Bloodmoon Beast.[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0020_camera_08	Have you ever heard of Ursaluna? Word is they\nweren’t all that uncommon a long, long time ago.[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0020_camera_09	See, Ursaluna is a Pokémon that usually has this\nbig yellow mark on its forehead resembling a full\r\nmoon—but they say this one’s mark is red...[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0020_camera_10	A red moon, as if seen through a veil of blood...\c\nThat’s why they call it the Bloodmoon Beast.[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0020_camera_11	This Ursaluna—the Bloodmoon Beast—used to\nlive in my homeland waaay back when people\r\nstill called the region Hisui.[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0020_camera_12	Seems like it crossed over the waters here to\nKitakami at some point and made itself comfy.[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0020_camera_13	If the two of us work together, I bet we could be\nthe ones to finally find and snap a shot of it.\r\nAnd if we do...[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0020_camera_14	Kiddo!\c\nNo, not “kiddo”—partner![VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0020_camera_15	Let’s tackle this together, so we can find the\nBloodmoon Beast for sure![VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0020_select_03	Let’s do it!
s1_side02_0020_select_04	I don’t know...
s1_side02_0020_camera_16	I knew you’d be up for it! And don’t worry—I’ll\nbe sure to reward your hard work.[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0020_camera_17	Aw, don’t be like that! I’ll even reward you for\nthe effort you put in![VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0020_camera_18	Word has it the Bloodmoon Beast has been seen\nin an area northeast of Oni Mountain called the\r\n[VAR FF00(0006)]Timeless Woods[VAR FF00(0000)]![VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0020_camera_19	I’ll head that way now and wait for you there![VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0020_camera_20	Come on, Growlithe![VAR 0114(0046)]

s1_side02_0030_camera_05	Wow, look at you! I didn’t even know you could\npull off that kind of expression! So photogenic![VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0030_camera_06	You’re just too adorable, you know that?! I could\neat you right up![VAR 0114(0046)]

s1_side02_0030_camera_08	More! I need more! Someone get me some extra\nstorage—and a napkin, too![VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0030_dog_01	Growawan!
s1_side02_0030_camera_09	Oh! Hey, partner! You made it![VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0030_camera_10	How long have you been standing there? You\nweren’t, uh, listening in on all that stuff I—\r\nNope! Don’t want to know! Forget I asked![VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0030_camera_11	I can’t help myself when I see adorable Pokémon\nlike that—I just had to snap a couple shots![VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0030_camera_12	Aaanyway, it’s right around this part of the\nforest where people have supposedly seen\r\nthe Bloodmoon Beast.[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0030_camera_13	Curiously, all the sightings have been on [VAR FF00(0006)]nights[VAR FF00(0000)]\n[VAR FF00(0006)]with heavy fog[VAR FF00(0000)].[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0030_camera_14	In fact, I’ve heard that all kinds of unusual\nPokémon appear on foggy nights.\c\nI’m sure that the Bloodmoon Beast is one of\nthem—it’s gotta be...[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0030_system_01	*rustle rustle rustle*
s1_side02_0030_camera_15	Oh, is that my little cutie pie, back for another\nphoto shoot?[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0030_poke_01	Shaaa!
s1_side02_0030_camera_16	Gyah?![VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0030_camera_17	Ow-ow-ow...[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0030_dog_02	Grrr-ow-ow!
s1_side02_0030_select_03	Better lend a hand!
s1_side02_0030_select_04	Better protect Growlithe!
s1_side02_0030_poke_02	Kiii-kiii-kiii!
s1_side02_0030_camera_18	Owww... That really surprised me.[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0030_camera_19	My camera’s OK, though. Thanks, partner.[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0030_dog_03	Bow-ow!
s1_side02_0030_camera_20	And thanks to you too, of course.[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0030_camera_21	I feel a bit bad for that Ariados. It probably\nwasn’t expecting to see humans out here.\r\nI bet it only attacked because it was surprised.[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0030_camera_22	We should set up a tent! That’ll let the Pokémon\nknow we’re here and help them get used to us![VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0035.dat
s1_side02_0035_camera_01	She may be old, but she’s still a fine tent, eh![VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0035_camera_02	It’s actually my dad’s, but he wasn’t using it, so I\njust helped myself to it.[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0035_camera_03	Say hello to our new base of operations for our\nsurvey of the Bloodmoon Beast![VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0035_dog_01	Wow-ow!
s1_side02_0035_camera_04	Now, the Bloodmoon Beast is way more wary\nthan an ordinary Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0035_camera_05	That’s why there have been so few sightings—or\nso they say.[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0035_camera_06	That means we’re going to need to do some slow\nand steady groundwork if we wanna find it![VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0035_camera_07	So, partner, what I’m going to need your help\nwith most...is [VAR FF00(0006)]photographing Pokémon[VAR FF00(0000)]![VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0035_camera_08	I want you to take photos of the Pokémon that\nappear around here on foggy nights.[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0035_camera_09	I’m looking for lots of pictures of a good variety\nof Pokémon![VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0035_camera_10	Afterward, I’ll register your photo data into my\nhandy Pokémon Searcher![VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0035_camera_11	Over time, that’ll train it to ignore any sign of\nother Pokémon that live around here.\c\nClearing all that noise will let us pinpoint\nexactly where the Bloodmoon Beast is![VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0035_select_01	Brilliant!
s1_side02_0035_select_02	I don’t get it!
s1_side02_0035_camera_12	Whoa, you actually understood that?![VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0035_camera_13	I was just rattling off what the manual said.\c\nI picked this thing up at a thrift shop. I don’t\nreally understand how it’s supposed to work.[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0035_camera_14	Right! Who would![VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0035_camera_15	To be honest, I’ve got no idea how it’s supposed\nto work either.\c\nI just picked this thing up at a thrift shop, and\nthat’s what it says to do in the manual.\c\nI’m sure it’ll be fine, right?[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0035_camera_16	My preliminary surveys make me think there are\nactually dozens of Pokémon species that tend to\r\nshow up around the forest on foggy nights.[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0035_camera_17	We can split the load, so how about you try and\nsnap photos of [VAR FF00(0006)]10 species [VAR FF00(0000)]of Pokémon for me?[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0035_camera_18	How ’bout it, partner? If we tackle this together,\nI’m sure we’ll find the Bloodmoon Beast![VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0035_camera_19	Oh, and we’re looking for clear photos that get\nthe Pokémon nice and big in the frame!\c\nYou’ll want to sneak up on foot to get close to\nthem—no riding on big, noisy Pokémon![VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0035_camera_20	Think you’re ready? Just say the word!\c\nOnce you’re good, we can set up in the tent\nand wait for a [VAR FF00(0006)]foggy night[VAR FF00(0000)].[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0040.dat
s1_side02_0040_camera_01	OK, so if we just compile the photos we both\ntook...[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0040_camera_02	It looks like we’ve photographed every Pokémon\nknown to appear in the forest when it’s foggy![VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0040_camera_03	We did it! We really pulled it off! I can’t tell you\nhow much I appreciate this![VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0040_dog_01	Grawa!
s1_side02_0040_camera_04	Now we just send all our data to the Pokémon\nSearcher, and...[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0040_camera_05	wait, I guess. It’s supposed to take a little bit for\nall the data to be, uh, processed. Or whatever.[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0040_camera_06	You know, the photos you took were all real\ngood, partner. You’ve got an eye for this![VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0040_camera_07	So, spill: What were you thinking about most\nwhen you were taking those photos?[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0040_select_01	Capturing the Pokémon as they are
s1_side02_0040_select_02	Showing off the Pokémon’s best sides
s1_side02_0040_select_03	I wasn’t really thinking about anything...
s1_side02_0040_camera_08	Trying to capture the Pokémon as they are...\c\nSo you really wanted to show how the Pokémon\nlive, pure and unadulterated, huh?[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0040_camera_09	Trying to show off the Pokémon’s best sides...\c\nSo you try to capture those moments when your\nsubject is really shining their brightest, huh?[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0040_camera_10	You weren’t thinking about anything, huh?\c\nI guess you were just capturing the world around\nyou with the natural instincts of a born artist.[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0040_camera_11	I, uh...I’m actually in a bit of slump myself.[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0040_camera_12	Even a kid like you knows what a slump is, right?\nLike, when nothing seems to go right for you.[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0040_camera_13	You might not believe it, but when I was younger,\nI was lauded as a photography prodigy...\r\nEveryone loved my photos! Absolutely everyone![VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0040_camera_14	But in these past few years, I feel like I’ve lost my\nspark—and my photos show it. They lack heart.\r\nThe awards have all dried up. The accolades too.[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0040_camera_15	And the longer it keeps dragging on...[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0040_camera_16	the more I lose sight of what it is I even want to\ncapture with my photos.[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0040_dog_02	Grawww...?
s1_side02_0040_camera_17	That’s when I heard the stories about the\nBloodmoon Beast.[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0040_camera_18	I left for Kitakami as fast as I could—I thought\nthat if I could just get a photo of an astounding\r\nPokémon like that, then maybe, just maybe...\r\nsomething inside me would change.[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0040_select_04	It’ll be OK!
s1_side02_0040_select_05	That’s rough...
s1_side02_0040_camera_19	Thanks, partner. And sorry. I didn’t mean to bring\nthe whole mood down with my problems.[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0040_camera_20	“That’s rough”? Hahaha! That’s all you’ve got?\nYou’re not very good at this comfort thing, kid.\r\nHahahaha, oh man, that killed me...[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0040_system_01	*dingle-dee-dee-dootle*
s1_side02_0040_camera_21	Oh, I guess the machine’s done doing its thing.\nBut...that jingle...[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0040_camera_22	I’m pretty sure that’s the same one my dryer\nplays when it’s done with a load...[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0040_camera_23	Hahaha, too funny! Who decided to use that?\nCan you just give anything a jingle now?[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0040_camera_24	Anyway, if we filter out all of our data...\c\nIt looks like there’s still one hit out there in the\nfoggy woods.[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0040_camera_25	That’s gotta be the Bloodmoon Beast. We’ve\nfinally found it...[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0040_camera_26	Heh. This is it! You know, talking to you really\nhelped me throw off some of that old tension.[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0040_camera_28	I think I’m ready to go meet the Bloodmoon\nBeast! How about you, partner? You ready?[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0040_camera_29	Yes! Then we’re off![VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0040_camera_30	Looks like your Pokémon Boxes might be full\nthere, partner.\c\nYou might want to keep some space open, just\nin case, right?[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0040_camera_27	Let me know as soon as you’re ready to go meet\nthe Bloodmoon Beast for yourself, then![VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0050.dat
s1_side02_0050_camera_01	You all ready to meet the Bloodmoon Beast?[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0050_camera_02	It’s supposed to be a fearsome creature...\c\nIn this case, there’s no such thing as being\noverprepared![VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0050_camera_03	Great! Now we just need some fog. Come on, we\ncan relax in the tent till it rolls in.[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0050_camera_04	The fog is pretty dense.[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0050_camera_05	It’s finally time for me to capture the Bloodmoon\nBeast...on film, that is![VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0050_camera_06	If things start to look dicey, I’ll be counting on\nyou to handle the battling, partner.[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0050_dog_01	Grrr-waw!
s1_side02_0050_camera_07	You too, of course, Growlithe![VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0050_camera_08	Now then, let’s get going![VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0050_camera_09	That hit we got on the Pokémon Searcher came\nfrom somewhere around here...[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0050_camera_10	It’s...awfully quiet.[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0050_select_01	Let’s stay alert
s1_side02_0050_select_02	Don’t let your guard down
s1_side02_0050_camera_11	Got it.[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0050_system_01	*STOMP* *STOMP*
s1_side02_0050_camera_12	Are those footsteps? Whatever’s making them\nmust be huge...[VAR 0114(0046)]

s1_side02_0050_bear_01	Wa-gaaaaaahhh!!
s1_side02_0050_camera_13	It’s got a red moon on its forehead![VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0050_camera_14	It’s the Bloodmoon Beast! It’s...it’s real!\nWe actually found it![VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0050_bear_02	Wa?

s1_side02_0050_camera_21	You OK, partner?![VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0050_camera_22	I didn’t seriously think you’d go toe-to-toe with\nthe Bloodmoon Beast, let alone catch it![VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0050_camera_23	That was amazing... Absolutely amazing![VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0050_dog_04	Grow-wow!
s1_side02_0050_camera_24	Growlithe...[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0050_camera_25	You’ve got to work on those nerves a bit, bud.[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0050_dog_06	Bowww...
s1_side02_0050_camera_26	Hah. But my heart is still beating a mile a minute!\nWhat a thrill![VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0050_camera_27	I just couldn’t stop snapping shots of you battling\nthe Bloodmoon Beast![VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0050_camera_28	I bet you want to give your Pokémon a chance to\nrest and recover though, huh, partner?\r\nLet’s head back to camp for now.[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0050_camera_29	Packing up the ol’ tent and calling it a day feels\na bit sad...like the end of an adventure.[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0050_camera_30	I couldn’t have done this without you, partner.[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0050_camera_31	Because of you, I finally feel like I have some\nphotos here that I want to keep forever...[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0050_camera_32	It’s been ages since I’ve felt this way. Seriously.[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0050_camera_33	And now that I’m all motivated, it’s time to ride\nthis feeling and seize the day!\c\nI’m heading back to the village this instant to get\nthese photos developed![VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0050_camera_34	As we always say in my family: “Time wasted is\nlost!” So I’m not wasting any more time![VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0050_camera_35	Let’s meet again in Mossui![VAR 0114(0046)]

s1_side02_0060_camera_boxfull	Hey, partner! Looks like you’re full up on\nPokémon, huh? No room in your party or Boxes!\c\nLook, I’m trying to keep it a surprise here, but\ntrust me when I say you’ll want to make some\r\nroom in your Boxes, then come talk to me again![VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0060_camera_01	I’ve been waiting for you to come by, partner![VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0060_camera_02	I managed to develop the photos I took of the\nBloodmoon Beast![VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0060_select_01	Show me!
s1_side02_0060_select_02	How do they look?
s1_side02_0060_camera_03	Oh, well, fact is that once I got them all printed\nout, I could see that the photos I managed to get\r\nare all blurry or cut off or out of focus...[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0060_camera_04	They really aren’t good enough to show anyone—\nnot even you, partner.[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0060_camera_05	But still...\c\nOut of all the photos I’ve ever taken, I think they\nmay be my favorites.[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0060_camera_06	I think I’d gotten too caught up in my own head.\nWorrying about framing or what judges might say,\r\nalways thinking about what I ought to capture...[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0060_camera_07	But just capturing your subjects as they are—\nthat’s what photos should be![VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0060_camera_08	You taught me something important, partner.\nSo...thanks for that.[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0060_camera_09	Ah! That’s right! Your name! I never even asked\nyou your name, partner![VAR 0114(0046)]

s1_side02_0060_camera_19	I think you’ll do a better job of raising it good\nand strong.[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0060_system_01	You received a Growlithe from Perrin!
s1_side02_0060_camera_20	Raise it to be reeeaaal strong, OK?[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0060_camera_21	I think that about wraps it up. I did what I came\nhere to do, so I guess I should hit the road.[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0060_camera_22	I’m afraid this is good-bye.[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0060_camera_23	But you know, Growlithe like these are known for\nliving and working together in pairs.[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0060_camera_24	Even if they are separated for a while, I bet\ntheir paths might just cross again someday...\r\nso you raise that one with care in the meantime![VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_0060_select_05	We’ll definitely meet again!

s1_side02_fieldwork.dat
s1_side02_fieldwork_sazare_01	Ready to go photograph some Pokémon and\nsurvey the forest for me?[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_fieldwork_select_01	Reporting for survey duty!
s1_side02_fieldwork_select_02	Maybe another time...
s1_side02_fieldwork_sazare_02	Then let’s hang in the tent until the weather gets\nnice and foggy.[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_fieldwork_sazare_03	Looks like this is about as good as it’s gonna get.\nAll right, partner! Get out there and survey![VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_fieldwork_sazare_poke_01	Took a new photo? Lemme see...[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_fieldwork_sazare_pokeget_01	That’s the Imitation Pokémon, Sudowoodo! It’s\nreal easy to mistake it for a tree in this fog.[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_fieldwork_sazare_pokeget_02	The Candle Pokémon, Litwick! Seeing those little\nlights floating in the dark is otherworldly, huh?[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_fieldwork_sazare_pokeget_03	The Calm Pokémon, Hatenna, huh? Must feel\nright at home in a quiet forest like this.[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_fieldwork_sazare_pokeget_04	It’s the Rock Pokémon, Geodude! You’ve gotta\nbe careful, or you might trip over this fella![VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_fieldwork_sazare_pokeget_05	That’s the Toxic Lizard Pokémon, Salandit, right?\nSneaking up on some prey in the dark, maybe?[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_fieldwork_sazare_pokeget_06	The Stag Beetle Pokémon, Vikavolt! Those huge\njaws it has make for a real killer photo![VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_fieldwork_sazare_pokeget_07	The Firefly Pokémon, Illumise! Word has it that it\ngets along real well with Volbeat.[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_fieldwork_sazare_pokeget_08	That’s the Acorn Pokémon, Seedot...right?! Pretty\neasy to mistake it for a Berry or something![VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_fieldwork_sazare_pokeget_09	That’s the String Spit Pokémon, Spinarak! Do you\nthink it’s trying to spin up a new web in the trees?[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_fieldwork_sazare_pokeget_10	The Cheeky Pokémon, Skwovet! What would you\nbet it’s looking for food from up in the trees?[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_fieldwork_sazare_pokeget_11	The Water Weed Pokémon, Lotad! Now that’s\nthe good life, just floating around like that...[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_fieldwork_sazare_pokeget_12	The EleFish Pokémon, Tynamo! You’ve got a real\nknack for this, spotting something so tiny![VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_fieldwork_sazare_pokeget_13	The Firefly Pokémon, Volbeat, huh? I heard it can\ndraw shapes using the light on its rear end![VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_fieldwork_sazare_pokeget_14	The Requiem Pokémon, Duskull... It makes quite\nthe impression on a dark night like this![VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_fieldwork_sazare_pokeget_15	The Owl Pokémon, Hoothoot! I’ve always wanted\nto get a shot of it switching the foot it stands on.[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_fieldwork_sazare_pokeget_16	You got both the Firefly Pokémon, Volbeat and\nIllumise! They look so good together. Great shot![VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_fieldwork_sazare_pokeget_17	The Firefly Pokémon, Illumise! I bet that Volbeat\nshowed up just to be with it, huh?[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_fieldwork_sazare_pokeget_18	The Firefly Pokémon, Volbeat! I bet that Illumise\nshowed up just to be with it, huh?[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_fieldwork_sazare_pokehint_01	This is great! I knew you were the right person\nfor the job![VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_fieldwork_sazare_pokehint_02	You really do take great photos, partner!\c\nHave you tried turning your eyes upward, too?\nThere may be Pokémon lurking up in the trees...[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_fieldwork_sazare_pokehint_03	You have a real eye for photography, partner!\c\nI bet you could even get great shots of Pokémon\nthat refuse to sit still and always wander around![VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_fieldwork_sazare_pokehint_04	That’s my partner for you!\c\nYou know, I bet there could be Pokémon in caves\nnearby too. You could probably snap some shots![VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_fieldwork_sazare_pokehint_05	You’ve got a real knack for this sort of thing!\c\nI bet getting those Pokémon that hang near the\nwater in the northwest part of the forest would\r\nbe a walk in the park for someone like you![VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_fieldwork_sazare_pokehint_06	Nice... You’ve done some real fine work here!\c\nOh, one tip from me? Watch your footing when\nyou get to that area with all the rocks—I tripped\r\nand nearly faceplanted in the dark![VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_fieldwork_sazare_pokehint_07	So it looks like you’ve got a real good handle on\nhow to take photos by now, huh?\c\nI bet you even know that some Pokémon are so\nwary they’ll run if you get too close! You’ve gotta\r\nbe careful if you wanna catch them on film![VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_fieldwork_sazare_pokehint_08	You are getting all kinds of different Pokémon\nin your photos!\c\nIt can be tricky—like with Ghost-type Pokémon!\nSnapping a photo of one before it disappears\r\nrequires a quick shutter finger![VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_fieldwork_sazare_pokehint_09	Mm-hmm! You’re getting real practiced at\ncatching Pokémon out and about their daily lives.\c\nI’d guess you could even catch Pokémon up in\nthe trees searching for their next meal![VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_fieldwork_sazare_pokehint_10	Just what I’ve come to expect of my partner!\nYour photos really showcase your good taste!\c\nOh, and did you hear that sound coming from the\nnortheast? Like thunder or something? I wonder\r\nif it could be Electric-type Pokémon...[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_fieldwork_sazare_pokehint_11	The composition! The motifs! I think your skills\nare wasted here in the backwater, helping me.\c\nOh, but before you abandon me...have you\nbeen up around the water in the northwest?[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_fieldwork_sazare_pokehint_12	I bet there are still some more Pokémon hiding in\nthe forest you haven’t photographed yet...[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_fieldwork_sazare_poke_02	Well, keep up the good work! I’ve got nothing\nbut high hopes for you, partner![VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_fieldwork_sazare_poke_03	Just one more Pokémon and your survey work\nwill be complete! Keep it up, partner![VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_fieldwork_sazare_pokemiss_01	Huh...? Wait, this picture doesn’t contain a single\nPokémon, does it?![VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_fieldwork_sazare_pokemiss_02	Ummm... Yeah, I’m not sure the machine will be\nable to process this without a clearer shot...[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_fieldwork_sazare_pokemiss_03	Nothing new to see here! Try looking for\nPokémon you haven’t photographed yet![VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_fieldwork_sazare_pokemiss_04	Hmm... Yeah, I don’t think the machine can get\nmuch from images so small. Can’t you get closer?[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_fieldwork_sazare_pokemiss_05	Hmm... Looks like the machine can’t use your\nphoto data.\c\nI guess it’s too hard to get a clear reading when\na Pokémon is in the process of running away?[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_fieldwork_sazare_pokeclear_01	And with that, you’ve completed your survey!\nWell done, partner![VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_fieldwork_stop_01	Do you want to end your survey early?
s1_side02_fieldwork_select_03	End it now
s1_side02_fieldwork_select_04	Keep going
s1_side02_fieldwork_stop_02	Okay, let’s call it! We’re all done for tonight!
s1_side02_fieldwork_pokenige_01	[~]
s1_side02_fieldwork_ride_01	Probably best not to ride on [VAR 1107(00FF,0202)]KoMiraidon if the aim\nis to sneak up on Pokémon...
s1_side02_fieldwork_ui_01_01	Get Those Photos!
s1_side02_fieldwork_ui_01_02	Open Camera
s1_side02_fieldwork_ui_01_03	End Survey
s1_side02_fieldwork_sazare_talk_01	How’s the survey coming along, partner?[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_fieldwork_sazare_camera_01	Huh? What’s this? You got a shot of me?[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_fieldwork_sazare_camera_02	Heh heh! Did you get a good shot? Hope I didn’t\nlook too stiff or anything![VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_fieldwork_sazare_camera_03	Wow, I’m not used to being on the other side of\na lens. It’s kind of awkward...[VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_fieldwork_sazare_camera_04	Gah! Stop, stop, stop! Now I’m all self-conscious\nand can’t look natural! It’s embarrassing![VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_fieldwork_sazare_camera_05	...OK, for real—I’m not your subject! Take photos\nof Pokémon already, would you![VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_side02_fieldwork_camera_01	It’s hard to get a good shot crouched down low...
s1_side02_fieldwork_growlithe_camera_01	Wa-wow!
s1_side02_fieldwork_growlithe_camera_02	Aw, you took Growlithe for me? You sweetie!\c\nI mean, sure, it’s no help at all for the survey,\nbut I still love to see his photos![VAR 0114(0046)]
s1_sub_001.dat
s1_sub_001_ecology_00	Oh! Well, if isn’t my pal [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nI’d actually love to grab your ear for something,\nbut...just look at how many Pokémon you’ve got!\c\nThink you could make some space in your Boxes\nor your team, then come talk to me again?[VAR 0114(002A)]
s1_sub_001_ecology_01	[VAR BD06(0000)]Oh, hello, hello, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nEnjoying\r\nthat\r\nschool\r\ntrip,\r\nare\r\nyou?[VAR 0114(002A)]
s1_sub_001_select_01	Mr. Jacq?!
s1_sub_001_select_02	Why’re you—?!
s1_sub_001_ecology_02	Hehe... I came to check on how you’re doing!\nI AM your homeroom teacher, after all.[VAR 0114(002A)]
s1_sub_001_ecology_03	Once I got here, I decided to do a bit of\nresearch on the Pokémon of Kitakami, and—[VAR 0114(002A)]
s1_sub_001_ecology_04	Oh! That’s right! Sorry![VAR 0114(002A)]
s1_sub_001_ecology_05	I got so engrossed in my own research that I\nactually forgot to come find you, didn’t I![VAR 0114(002A)]
s1_sub_001_ecology_06	Well, how about I make up for it by treating you\nto a picnic?[VAR 0114(002A)]
s1_sub_001_ecology_07	I thought something like this might happen,\nso I borrowed all the usual picnic things from\r\nDirector Clavell.[VAR 0114(002A)]
s1_sub_001_ecology_08	Dig in! I hope you like the sandwich I made![VAR 0114(002A)]
s1_sub_001_ecology_09	It may, um, look a bit strange—but I can assure\nyou it tastes great![VAR 0114(002A)]
s1_sub_001_ecology_10	I don’t get out much, so this kind of fieldwork\nsure wears me out quick...[VAR 0114(002A)]
s1_sub_001_ecology_11	I can’t believe how you kids run all over the place\nfor your Treasure Hunt! You’re really something![VAR 0114(002A)]
s1_sub_001_ecology_12	Oh...? Could there be something in my basket?[VAR 0114(002A)]
s1_sub_001_ecology_13	Feast your eyes on that![VAR 0114(002A)]
s1_sub_001_ecology_14	A Pokémon Egg appeared in the basket![VAR 0114(002A)]
s1_sub_001_ecology_15	Quite the mystery, isn’t it? I only brought Gulpin\nto this picnic with me, and yet...[VAR 0114(002A)]
s1_sub_001_select_03	How could it have appeared, then?
s1_sub_001_select_04	Did you put the Egg in the basket?
s1_sub_001_ecology_16	Hehe... OK, I confess! Truth is, I had this Egg\nwith me the whole time.[VAR 0114(002A)]
s1_sub_001_ecology_17	[VAR BD06(0000)]Hehe... I can’t get anything past you, can I,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(002A)]
s1_sub_001_ecology_18	You know about the Pokémon Eggs you can find\nduring picnics, right?[VAR 0114(002A)]
s1_sub_001_ecology_19	Whenever a Trainer doesn’t have the means to\ncare for an Egg they find, they can have it sent to\r\nthe academy, where we’ll take care of it.[VAR 0114(002A)]
s1_sub_001_ecology_20	But then I thought, “Say, wouldn’t it be better to\nhave a great Trainer raise the Pokémon instead?”\r\nSo I brought this Egg with me![VAR 0114(002A)]
s1_sub_001_ecology_21	And now...it’s yours, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(002A)]
s1_sub_001_system_01	You were entrusted with the Pokémon Egg!
s1_sub_001_ecology_22	[VAR BD06(0000)]Hehe... I know it’s odd of me to come all the way\nto Kitakami just to hand over a Pokémon Egg.\c\nBut I knew it would be safe with you,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(002A)]
s1_sub_001_ecology_23	That reminds me—are you still using your\nPokédex app over here too?[VAR 0114(002A)]
s1_sub_001_ecology_24	You should be able to fill the Kitakami Pokédex\nby catching Pokémon that live around here.[VAR 0114(002A)]
s1_sub_001_ecology_25	I’ll be doing fieldwork in the area for a while...[VAR 0114(002A)]
s1_sub_001_ecology_26	so let me know if you manage to complete the\nKitakami Pokédex in your app![VAR 0114(002A)]

s1_sub_007_woman_03	Y-you’re telling me this is a lake?! Surely it can’t\nbe more than a pond![VAR 0114(0041)]
s1_sub_007_woman_04	Say, Billy—what’s the difference between a lake\nand a pond, anyway?[VAR 0114(0041)]
s1_sub_007_man_02	I’m not sure, dearest O’Nare... We Glitterati\ndon’t tend to clutter our heads with such trivial\r\ncommon knowledge...[VAR 0114(0040)]

s1_sub_008_woman_05	Oh my! That’s awfully flimsy, isn’t it?![VAR 0114(0041)]
s1_sub_008_woman_06	Say, Billy—do you suppose commoners have an\neasier time dealing with the cold?[VAR 0114(0041)]
s1_sub_008_man_05	I’m not sure... But I’ve heard that commoners say\nwe Glitterati “line our pockets with money.”\c\nPerhaps that means the high quality of our\nclothing is unusual to them?[VAR 0114(0040)]
s1_sub_008_man_06	If all commoners dress like our dearest one here,\nthen they must simply be used to the cold![VAR 0114(0040)]

s1_sub_008_woman_12	You must never, ever forget that![VAR 0114(0041)]
s1_sub_008_man_08	That’s my dearest O’Nare! Your aphorisms are\nbecoming more off-the-cuff by the day![VAR 0114(0040)]

s1_sub_009_man_02	We mustn’t, dearest O’Nare! Entering the crater\nis strictly forbidden! I petitioned the League for\r\naccess, but to no avail...[VAR 0114(0040)]
s1_sub_009_woman_04	I beg your pardon?! They won’t even let a\nGlitterati enter?[VAR 0114(0041)]

s1_sub_009_man_04	You’re right! Your eyes do not deceive you—\nit’s that commoner who can’t get enough of us![VAR 0114(0040)]
s1_sub_009_woman_07	Say, dear commoner... Have you entered this\ncrater before, perchance?[VAR 0114(0041)]
s1_sub_009_select_01	I have!

s1_sub_009_woman_08	Rags to riches! This commoner’s had the fortune\nto enter the crater, but the Glitterati have not?![VAR 0114(0041)]
s1_sub_009_woman_09	If neither the common folk nor the Glitterati are\nallowed inside, just who is?! I don’t understand![VAR 0114(0041)]
s1_sub_009_woman_10	Well, then. It seems we have no choice but\nto duel.[VAR 0114(0041)]

s1_sub_009_woman_12	One last duel—what do you say?[VAR 0114(0041)]
s1_sub_009_woman_13	You know, I think I quite like it when a commoner\ntells me no now and then...\c\nBut the time of a Glitterati is exceedingly\nvaluable! We will have this battle RIGHT NOW![VAR 0114(0041)]

sch_entrance01_girl_08	Reading out loud from your textbook gets your\nears and mouth in on the learning!
sch_entrance01_girl_09	I joined the school because I wanted to learn\nabout Pokémon, but now I’m getting interested\r\nin the STEM track too!
sch_entrance01_boy_11	Bug types eat grass—that’s why they’re strong\nagainst Grass types!
sch_entrance01_boy_12	I asked so many questions that the teacher\nlearned my name on the first day!
sch_entrance01_woman_03	So between a Super Potion and a Hyper Potion,\nwhich one heals your Pokémon more?

sdc01_0090_caretaker_06	On each signboard, you’ll find snippets of an\nold folktale passed down here in Kitakami.\r\nRead them all and learn a bit about our home.[VAR 0114(0045)]
sdc01_0090_caretaker_07	To prove you’ve completed the task, we ask that\neach pair take a snapshot together in front of\r\nthese signboards with their phone or camera.[VAR 0114(0045)]

sdc01_0090_caretaker_09	It’s a self-guided tour of Kitakami! Learn all\nabout its rich history![VAR 0114(0045)]
sdc01_0090_caretaker_10	Much more fun than sitting around and listening\nto me ramble on and on, eh?[VAR 0114(0045)]
sdc01_0090_bbteacher_04	Wonderful! What an innovative idea for a group\nactivity![VAR 0114(0042)]
sdc01_0090_caretaker_11	Oh, and I’ve got a gift for each of you as well![VAR 0114(0045)]

sdc01_0090_system_01	You learned the [VAR FF00(0008)]Eureka emote[VAR FF00(0000)] from the\ncaretaker!
sdc01_0090_bbteacher_05	Ah, yes. Real...rad...[VAR 0114(0042)]
sdc01_0090_bbteacher_06	Remember that one of the goals of this trip is to\ndeepen the ties between our two schools.[VAR 0114(0042)]
sdc01_0090_bbteacher_07	It seems like having someone who knows the\narea well would be a big help. That being said...[VAR 0114(0042)]
sdc01_0090_bbteacher_08	Let’s try to maximize the number of interschool\npairs, OK? Time to mingle![VAR 0114(0042)]
sdc01_0090_caretaker_13	Be sure to tell me if Carmine or Kieran cause\nyou any trouble during your stay.[VAR 0114(0045)]

sdc01_0100_sister_09	See, my brother’s no good at talking to people.[VAR 0114(0044)]
sdc01_0100_sister_10	He’d probably never work up the nerve to ask\nyou himself, but he’d really like a battle with you.[VAR 0114(0044)]
sdc01_0100_sister_11	C’mon, please? Just have a battle with my\nbrother, would you?[VAR 0114(0044)]

sdc01_0100_sister_20	Don’t what? It’s not like we can pair up. Or were\nyou hoping to partner with some other rando\r\noutsider instead of [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0044)]

sdc01_0230_history_01	A long, long time ago, a man and an ogre came\nto Kitakami from a foreign land.[VAR 0114(0030)]
sdc01_0230_history_02	The people of the village feared the man and the\nogre, who looked so different from them...[VAR 0114(0030)]
sdc01_0230_history_03	And so they refused to let the travelers come\nanywhere near the village.[VAR 0114(0030)]
sdc01_0230_history_04	The man and the ogre were saddened that the\nvillagers did not welcome them...[VAR 0114(0030)]

sdc01_0230_history_06	There was only one villager who pitied the two\ntravelers: the village mask maker.[VAR 0114(0030)]
sdc01_0230_history_07	He made several masks for the man and the ogre.[VAR 0114(0030)]
sdc01_0230_history_08	The masks were brilliant works, adorned with\ngems the man brought from somewhere far away.[VAR 0114(0030)]

sdc01_0230_history_14	But rumors of exquisite, shining masks attract\nmore than just innocent curiosity...[VAR 0114(0030)]
sdc01_0230_history_15	A group of greedy Pokémon soon made their way\nto the land of Kitakami.[VAR 0114(0030)]
sdc01_0230_history_16	These Pokémon sneaked into the cave in which\nthe man and the ogre lived...[VAR 0114(0030)]
sdc01_0230_history_17	and tried to make off with the masks, which were\ncarefully stored away.[VAR 0114(0030)]
sdc01_0230_history_18	The man happened to be there. He managed to\nhold on to one of the masks...[VAR 0114(0030)]
sdc01_0230_history_19	but he was not strong enough to protect them all.\nThe Pokémon stole the other three masks.[VAR 0114(0030)]
sdc01_0230_history_20	Several hours later, when the ogre returned to\nthe cave...[VAR 0114(0030)]
sdc01_0230_history_21	it found its beloved home in ruin. All that was left\nwere the signs of a struggle and a teal mask.[VAR 0114(0030)]
sdc01_0230_history_22	The ogre donned that mask and went down to\nthe village, perhaps to search for its friend.[VAR 0114(0030)]
sdc01_0230_history_23	It found the greedy Pokémon there, gloating over\ntheir stolen masks, and defeated them.[VAR 0114(0030)]

sdc01_0230_history_27	To honor their sacrifice, the villagers named them\nthe Loyal Three and interred them with care.[VAR 0114(0030)]
sdc01_0230_history_28	Wounded and weak, the ogre returned to its\ncave—alone and with great sadness.[VAR 0114(0030)]

sdc01_0260_gfather_05	The villagers believe their own version of history.[VAR 0114(0030)]
sdc01_0260_gfather_06	They revere the Loyal Three—so how would they\nreact to being told that they’ve got it all wrong?[VAR 0114(0030)]
sdc01_0260_sister_05	They’d probably get...angry?[VAR 0114(0044)]
sdc01_0260_gfather_07	Exactly.[VAR 0114(0030)]
sdc01_0260_gfather_08	Back when this all first occurred, the mask\nmaker—that is to say, our ancestor—tried\r\ndesperately to tell the truth of the matter.[VAR 0114(0030)]
sdc01_0260_gfather_09	But nobody would take him seriously. In fact, it’s\nsaid he was persecuted as a heretic.[VAR 0114(0030)]
sdc01_0260_sister_06	Oooh, that REALLY gets my blood boiling![VAR 0114(0044)]
sdc01_0260_gfather_10	In the end, the mask maker chose to protect his\ndescendants—us—by keeping his mouth shut.[VAR 0114(0030)]
sdc01_0260_gfather_11	However, he kept the truth alive—passed down\nfrom generation to generation as a family secret.[VAR 0114(0030)]

sdc01_0260_gfather_12	He shouldn’t, no—I’ve certainly never spoken to\nhim about it. Why do you ask?[VAR 0114(0030)]
sdc01_0260_sister_09	I dunno. He just really seems to like the ogre...\nHe’s practically obsessed.[VAR 0114(0044)]
sdc01_0260_sister_10	And he’s been trying to one-up me—as if he\nknows more about Ogerpon than I do.[VAR 0114(0044)]
sdc01_0260_gfather_13	Well, I can’t say what’s going on with the boy...\nbut he always was a sensitive child. It wouldn’t\r\nsurprise me if he’s somehow intuited the truth.[VAR 0114(0030)]
sdc01_0260_gfather_14	I promise to tell Kieran the whole story when the\ntime is right.[VAR 0114(0030)]
sdc01_0260_gfather_15	Until then, take care not to breathe a word of the\ntruth to anybody![VAR 0114(0030)]
sdc01_0260_sister_11	OK, Grandpa...[VAR 0114(0044)]
sdc01_0260_sister_12	Now I REALLY can’t tell Kiki we met the ogre...[VAR 0114(0044)]
sdc01_0260_gfather_16	About that mask you showed me...I noticed the\njewel on its forehead was chipped.[VAR 0114(0030)]
sdc01_0260_gfather_17	I might be able to fix it. Would you mind leaving\nthe mask with me for a little while?[VAR 0114(0030)]
sdc01_0260_sister_13	Oh, huh. Maybe it got chipped when it fell down\nthe stairs?[VAR 0114(0044)]
sdc01_0260_sister_14	Since Grandpa’s offering, let’s get it all nice and\nfixed up before we give it back to Ogerpon![VAR 0114(0044)]
sdc01_0260_system_01	You gave the Teal Mask to Carmine’s grandfather!
sdc01_0260_gfather_18	Don’t you worry. I’ll be sure to take good care\nof this.[VAR 0114(0030)]
sdc01_0260_sister_15	I wanna see Ogerpon again, but getting its mask\nfixed will have to come first.[VAR 0114(0044)]
sdc01_0260_sister_16	For now, we should carry on with the orienteering\nbefore Kiki gets suspicious.[VAR 0114(0044)]
sdc01_0260_sister_17	I bet we’ll find Kiki just killing time somewhere\nin town![VAR 0114(0044)]
sdc01_0260_sister_18	The boy I partnered up with is so...ordinary.\nPretty underwhelming, if I’m being honest.[VAR 0114(0044)]
sdc01_0260_gfather_19	You mustn’t tell anybody about the true history\nof our village.\c\nNow, I’d better get everything ready to fix the\nogre’s mask![VAR 0114(0030)]

sdc01_0270_brother_04	S-so! About those signs! The last one’s a bit of a\nhike away.[VAR 0114(0043)]
sdc01_0270_brother_07	It’s in the [VAR FF00(0006)]Paradise Barrens[VAR FF00(0000)] on the other side of\nOni Mountain.\c\nWe’ll need to head over the mountain and down\ntoward the northwest...[VAR 0114(0043)]

sdc01_0270_brother_06	Why...why’d you lie to me...?[VAR 0114(0043)]
sdc01_0270_sister_01	Don’t worry, I’ll do the whole orienteering thing\nlike a good li’l student. Keep a low profile, OK?[VAR 0114(0044)]
sdc01_0270_student1_01	Carmine’s actually taking this orienteering thing\nseriously! FINALLY!

sdc01_0280_student1_02	Carmine wanted me to tell you that she’s waiting\nat her place. She said, “You’d better get a move\r\non—and don’t keep me waiting!”
sdc01_0280_student1_03	I’m her partner, and yet you’re the one who gets\ninvited to her house... What exactly is going on\r\nwith you two, anyway?
sdc01_0280_student2_01	The caretaker showed us some really cool masks\nyesterday!
sdc01_0280_student3_01	You’re already done with the assignment?!\nWow, that was fast!\c\nThe girl I’m paired with is taking it slow for me—\nshe’s making sure I don’t overexert myself.
sdc01_0280_bbteacher_01	Some student pairs haven’t finished the\norienteering assignment yet.\c\nIn the meantime, why not do some exploring?\nEnjoy Kitakami to your heart’s content![VAR 0114(0042)]

sdc01_0290_gfather_01	I wanted to fix dear Ogerpon’s mask, but...[VAR 0114(0030)]
sdc01_0290_gfather_02	I’ll need one more material if I want to do a\nproper job of it.[VAR 0114(0030)]
sdc01_0290_sister_03	Yeah...[VAR 0114(0044)]
sdc01_0290_sister_04	According to Grandpa, we need to get a [VAR FF00(0006)]Crystal[VAR FF00(0000)]\n[VAR FF00(0006)]Cluster[VAR FF00(0000)] from the bottom of the Crystal Pool.[VAR 0114(0044)]
sdc01_0290_sister_05	I mean, we COULD just return the mask as it is.[VAR 0114(0044)]
sdc01_0290_sister_06	But I think it would make Ogerpon real happy if\nwe fixed it up first![VAR 0114(0044)]
sdc01_0290_select_01	Yeah, I bet it would!
sdc01_0290_select_02	That’s a nice thing to do
sdc01_0290_sister_07	Especially now that I’ve heard the real story...\nI just want Ogerpon to be happy, you know?[VAR 0114(0044)]
sdc01_0290_gfather_03	I’m sure Ogerpon will be pleased to know you\ncare so much for it.[VAR 0114(0030)]
sdc01_0290_sister_08	Right?[VAR 0114(0044)]

sdc01_0290_sister_09	Kiki! You’d better go kill time somewhere—[VAR 0114(0044)]
sdc01_0290_brother_02	Yeah, yeah. Do whatever you want, Sis.[VAR 0114(0043)]
sdc01_0290_sister_10	E-excuse me?! I don’t need that kinda attitude\nfrom you![VAR 0114(0044)]
sdc01_0290_brother_03	I got stuff to do, OK?[VAR 0114(0043)]
sdc01_0290_sister_11	What’s his problem? He’s been all bent out of\nshape since yesterday.[VAR 0114(0044)]
sdc01_0290_gfather_05	I don’t know... He spent the evening in his room\nwithout so much as a bite of dinner.[VAR 0114(0030)]
sdc01_0290_sister_12	Must be teen angst or something. It happens![VAR 0114(0044)]
sdc01_0290_sister_13	[VAR BD06(0000)]It woulda been hard to get stuff done with Kiki\nclinging to you, [VAR 0100(0000)].\r\nGuess\r\nthings\r\nworked\r\nout\r\nin\r\nour\r\nfavor![VAR 0114(0044)]
sdc01_0290_sister_14	The Crystal Pool’s at the top of Oni Mountain.[VAR 0114(0044)]
sdc01_0290_sister_15	I’m usually not too keen on outsiders heading\nup the mountain, but I think we can make an\r\nexception for you![VAR 0114(0044)]
sdc01_0290_sister_16	What say you and I go for a hike to find\nourselves a Crystal Cluster?[VAR 0114(0044)]
sdc01_0290_gfather_06	The Pokémon around the Crystal Pool are strong.\nYou be careful out there.[VAR 0114(0030)]
sdc01_0290_student1_01	You already found all three signs?! Me and\nCarmine only just made it to one!
sdc01_0290_student2_01	Is Kieran upset about something? I said hi, but I\ndon’t think he even noticed me...
sdc01_0290_student3_01	I wish I could spend all my time at the festival!\nBut I guess I need to work on the assignment...

sdc01_0300_sister_02	This is the Crystal Pool. Bet you didn’t expect it\nto be so pretty, huh?[VAR 0114(0044)]
sdc01_0300_sister_03	The crystals here are always shining. Isn’t that\nstrange? There’s even a weird rumor that you\r\ncan meet people here who’ve passed away.[VAR 0114(0044)]
sdc01_0300_sister_04	Now we’ll just need to get a little bit of the\ncrystal from the bottom of the pool so we can\r\nfix the mask properly![VAR 0114(0044)]
sdc01_0300_sister_05	[VAR BD06(0000)]And that’s where you come in,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]!\r\nGo on,\r\nthen!\r\nJump in!\r\nDon’t\r\nbe\r\nscared![VAR 0114(0044)]

sdc01_0300_select_02	Jump in? Like, into the pool?!
sdc01_0300_sister_06	Well, yeah. I can’t swim. And besides, my clothes\nwould get soaked if I did it.[VAR 0114(0044)]
sdc01_0300_sister_07	You’ve got a real nifty Pokémon to ride on, right?\nYou’ll be fiiiiiine![VAR 0114(0044)]

sdc01_0300_sister_10	Now that I think about it, Pokémon like that one\ndo show up here from time to time...[VAR 0114(0044)]
sdc01_0300_sister_11	Y’know, you’re pretty handy to have around in a\nbattle, aren’t you?[VAR 0114(0044)]
sdc01_0300_sister_12	Hey, is that...?[VAR 0114(0044)]
sdc01_0300_sister_13	Maybe it was stuck to that Pokémon you fought?[VAR 0114(0044)]
sdc01_0300_bbteacher_01	The energy coming from those crystals at the\nbottom of the pool... I knew it![VAR 0114(0042)]

sdc01_0300_bbteacher_03	I’m aware that this is sacred ground, yes.[VAR 0114(0042)]
sdc01_0300_bbteacher_04	I did get permission from the caretaker, though.\nWas that not sufficient?[VAR 0114(0042)]
sdc01_0300_sister_16	...Why did you come here?[VAR 0114(0044)]
sdc01_0300_bbteacher_05	Oh, just doing a bit of field research. I was\ninterested in the properties of the water here.[VAR 0114(0042)]
sdc01_0300_bbteacher_06	And, well...my hunch was on the money![VAR 0114(0042)]
sdc01_0300_bbteacher_07	You see, the Crystal Pool’s waters emit energy\nof the same wavelength as Terastal energy.\r\nThough I have no idea why that is...[VAR 0114(0042)]
sdc01_0300_bbteacher_08	Once I figure that out, I might be able to\nstabilize the Terastal phenomenon in regions\r\nother than Paldea![VAR 0114(0042)]
sdc01_0300_sister_17	Uh, I see...[VAR 0114(0044)]

sdc01_0300_sister_19	Let’s head back, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0044)]
sdc01_0300_bbteacher_09	If I can just get the Terastal phenomenon to\nreliably occur in regions other than Paldea, that\r\nshould bring me one step closer to Terapagos...[VAR 0114(0042)]

sdc01_0310_sister_03	What? Why would Kiki do that?![VAR 0114(0044)]
sdc01_0310_sister_04	Did you tell him about the ogre or something?![VAR 0114(0044)]

sdc01_0350_caretaker_04	But yes, you did miss out on an incredible treat!\c\nThe Loyal Three were just visiting our humble\nlittle hall![VAR 0114(0045)]
sdc01_0350_caretaker_05	It seemed they wished to collect the shining\nmasks we’ve kept safe here at Kitakami Hall...[VAR 0114(0045)]
sdc01_0350_caretaker_06	so naturally we representatives of the hall were\nhappy to return the masks to them with all haste![VAR 0114(0045)]
sdc01_0350_sister_03	You gave them the masks?![VAR 0114(0044)]
sdc01_0350_caretaker_07	And we offered them a platter of our special\nKitakami Mochi, packed full of our best herbs!\r\nThe Loyal Three gobbled them up in a flash![VAR 0114(0045)]
sdc01_0350_sister_04	And you FED them?![VAR 0114(0044)]
sdc01_0350_person_01	Kitakami Mochi are full of nutrition! The Loyal\nThree are bigger and stronger now, I’m sure!
sdc01_0350_sister_05	But those lousy three are the bad guys! The masks\nbelong to Ogerpon!\c\nUgh, I really wish I could tell them everything...[VAR 0114(0044)]
sdc01_0350_sister_06	So, where did those three go?[VAR 0114(0044)]
sdc01_0350_caretaker_08	They went at once to ascend Oni Mountain![VAR 0114(0045)]
sdc01_0350_caretaker_09	Perhaps they have it in mind to finish off the\nterrible ogre that lurks in the Dreaded Den.[VAR 0114(0045)]
sdc01_0350_caretaker_10	No wonder they were dubbed the Loyal Three!\nSuch hardworking heroes they are! Hahaha!
sdc01_0350_sister_07	This isn’t the time to be laughing at all![VAR 0114(0044)]
sdc01_0350_sister_08	If the story we heard is true, then those three\nmust’ve gone to get revenge on Ogerpon.[VAR 0114(0044)]
sdc01_0350_sister_09	They say the ogre fought using the powers of its\nmasks.[VAR 0114(0044)]
sdc01_0350_sister_10	But Ogerpon doesn’t have any masks right now,\nright?! It won’t stand a chance![VAR 0114(0044)]
sdc01_0350_select_01	We should help it!
sdc01_0350_select_02	Let’s return its mask!
sdc01_0350_sister_11	Yeah, we’re on the same page! But we should\nsplit up![VAR 0114(0044)]
sdc01_0350_sister_12	You head to the Dreaded Den and help\nOgerpon![VAR 0114(0044)]
sdc01_0350_sister_13	I’ll go back home to get the mask fixed up! Give\nme the mask and the crystal![VAR 0114(0044)]
sdc01_0350_system_01	You gave Carmine the Teal Mask and the Crystal\nCluster.
sdc01_0350_sister_14	Thanks![VAR 0114(0044)]
sdc01_0350_sister_15	I’ll head your way the moment the mask’s fixed!\nUntil then, make sure Ogerpon’s safe![VAR 0114(0044)]

sdc01_0360_brother_03	A-about the mask. I just got so angry, and...[VAR 0114(0043)]
sdc01_0360_brother_04	What I did was real dumb...[VAR 0114(0043)]
sdc01_0360_brother_05	So... I’m sorry.[VAR 0114(0043)]

sdc01_0360_sister_07	He was sulkin’ around, so I grabbed him by the\ncollar and dragged him here![VAR 0114(0044)]
sdc01_0360_sister_08	And, well...I’m glad I did![VAR 0114(0044)]
sdc01_0360_ogre_03	Pon pon.
sdc01_0360_brother_07	It’s really you... The real-life ogre...[VAR 0114(0043)]
sdc01_0360_brother_08	Wowzers... You’re really something![VAR 0114(0043)]
sdc01_0360_sister_09	You wanted to be the one to give the mask back\nto Ogerpon, right, Kiki?[VAR 0114(0044)]
sdc01_0360_brother_09	This is...for you, dear ogre.[VAR 0114(0043)]
sdc01_0360_ogre_04	Gah... Grrr...
sdc01_0360_sister_10	It seems scared... Maybe it’s not good with new\npeople, Kiki.[VAR 0114(0044)]
sdc01_0360_brother_10	... ... ...[VAR 0114(0043)]
sdc01_0360_brother_11	I don’t think it’ll take the mask if I’m the one\ngiving it back. You should be the one to do it,\r\n[VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0043)]
sdc01_0360_system_01	You returned the Teal Mask to Ogerpon!

sdc01_0360_sister_13	It’d be nice if we could give the other three\nmasks back to Ogerpon too, don’t you think?[VAR 0114(0044)]
sdc01_0360_brother_13	Did those... Did those three Pokémon take the\nmasks that were in Kitakami Hall?[VAR 0114(0043)]
sdc01_0360_sister_14	Yeah! Never mind that the masks rightfully belong\nto poor Ogerpon here![VAR 0114(0044)]
sdc01_0360_sister_15	I wouldn’t put it past the so-called Loyal Three\nto plot a second ambush, either. We need to\r\nkeep Ogerpon safe while we deal with them![VAR 0114(0044)]
sdc01_0360_sister_16	That means the three of us are gonna form a\nteam—the Mask Retrieval Squad![VAR 0114(0044)]
sdc01_0360_select_03	Count me in!

sdc01_side01_010_system_06	In admiration, the people of the village bestowed\nupon this brave trio the title “the Loyal Three.”
sdc01_side01_010_system_07	Their remains were given a proper burial, and\nstatues of the three were erected above the site.
sdc01_side01_010_brother_27	The Loyal Three Monument is right over there...[VAR 0114(0043)]
sdc01_side01_010_brother_06	But don’t you think the ogre in that folktale\nsounds kinda...cool?[VAR 0114(0043)]
sdc01_side01_010_select_01	Yeah, it sure does!
sdc01_side01_010_select_02	You think...?
sdc01_side01_010_brother_07	[VAR BD06(0000)]Right?! I knew you’d get it,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nIt was up against three whole opponents at once,\nbattling it out all by itself—wowzers, that’s so cool![VAR 0114(0043)]
sdc01_side01_010_brother_08	C’mon, it was all alone!\c\nThe battle was three against one, but the ogre\nstill managed to hold its own. That’s way cool![VAR 0114(0043)]
sdc01_side01_010_brother_09	Oh... But I guess most people would just think\nan ogre like that is scary, huh? I don’t think\r\nthere’s any reason to be afraid...[VAR 0114(0043)]
sdc01_side01_010_brother_10	When I was little, I went up into the mountain so\nmany times at night—all on my own—an’ I never\r\nonce met that ogre.[VAR 0114(0043)]
sdc01_side01_010_brother_11	Only scary thing that happened was the\ngrown-ups givin’ me a real earful about it...[VAR 0114(0043)]
sdc01_side01_010_brother_12	Umm... So yeah, we’re s’posed to take a photo\nin front of the signboard, right?[VAR 0114(0043)]
sdc01_side01_010_brother_13	I don’t have a smartphone... Could you...?[VAR 0114(0043)]
sdc01_side01_010_brother_14	That turned out great. You’re even good at\ntaking photos...[VAR 0114(0043)]
sdc01_side01_010_select_03	Thanks!
sdc01_side01_010_select_04	You wanna try?
sdc01_side01_010_brother_15	S-sorry... Not trying to butter you up or anythin’...[VAR 0114(0043)]
sdc01_side01_010_brother_16	Oh! No! I didn’t mean—\c\nM-maybe...next time...[VAR 0114(0043)]
sdc01_side01_010_brother_17	Y’know...I didn’t wanna have to come do this\nwhole school trip thing, but...well...it might\r\nactually be kinda fun...[VAR 0114(0043)]
sdc01_side01_010_brother_18	I get to be out in nature around my hometown...\nand talk to you, [VAR 0100(0000)]...[VAR 0114(0043)]
sdc01_side01_010_brother_19	H-hey, if you want, maybe we could set up a\npicnic. Would you like a sandwich—?[VAR 0114(0043)]
sdc01_side01_010_legend_01	Agia!
sdc01_side01_010_brother_20	Gyah! Wh-what is that thing?! Some kinda...kaiju\nor somethin’?![VAR 0114(0043)]
sdc01_side01_010_select_05a	A “kaiju”? This is Koraidon!
sdc01_side01_010_select_05b	A “kaiju”? This is Miraidon!
sdc01_side01_010_select_06	This is my ride. It’s called [VAR 1107(00FF,0202)]KoMiraidon!
sdc01_side01_010_brother_21	It’s called Koraidon? And you ride on it, huh...?\nI’ve never seen another Pokémon like this...[VAR 0114(0043)]
sdc01_side01_010_brother_22	It’s called Miraidon? And you ride on it, huh...?\nI’ve never seen another Pokémon like this...[VAR 0114(0043)]
sdc01_side01_010_brother_23	And it seriously comes out whenever it hears\nthe word “sandwich”?[VAR 0114(0043)]
sdc01_side01_010_legend_03	Agias.
sdc01_side01_010_brother_24	Never thought I’d actually get to meet such an\nawesome Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0043)]
sdc01_side01_010_brother_25	[VAR BD06(0000)]No wonder you’re so strong,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]...\r\nYou’re...you’re\r\nspecial.[VAR 0114(0043)]
sdc01_side01_010_brother_26	So, the next—! Errr, we should go find the next\nsignboard! It’s on the grounds of Kitakami Hall.\c\nUm, Kitakami Hall is...\c\nWell, first double back to town from here, then\nthere’s this bridge you cross, and from there,\r\nyou’ll need to climb up the mountainside.\c\nI’ll hang back for now an’ meet you there later![VAR 0114(0043)]
sdc01_side01_010_legend_02	Agia...?
sdc01_side01_020.dat
sdc01_side01_020_brother_01	That’s the second signboard. Bit tricky to find,\nhuh?[VAR 0114(0043)]
sdc01_side01_020_brother_02	S-sorry... I’m followin’ at a distance, so...I...I hope\nyou can get used to me showing up like this.[VAR 0114(0043)]

sdc01_side01_020_system_01	The ogre possessed four mysterious, glimmering\nmasks.
sdc01_side01_020_system_02	It is said that depending on the mask the ogre\ndonned, the powers of its cudgel would change.
sdc01_side01_020_system_03	When wearing the teal mask, it could bring life\nback into withered greenery around it.
sdc01_side01_020_system_04	When wearing the crimson mask, it could turn a\ncandle’s flame into a raging inferno.
sdc01_side01_020_system_05	When wearing the blue mask, it could stop the\nvery flow of a river.
sdc01_side01_020_system_06	When wearing the ashen gray mask, it could\neasily break the hardest stone in two.
sdc01_side01_020_system_07	Before the Loyal Three fell, they wrested away\nthree of the ogre’s masks, greatly weakening it.
sdc01_side01_020_brother_10	Did you read it...?[VAR 0114(0043)]

sdc01_side01_020_brother_32	The masks the Loyal Three stole are kept over at\nKitakami Hall.[VAR 0114(0043)]
sdc01_side01_020_brother_14	Everyone in town is scared of the ogre...but me?\nI really like it.[VAR 0114(0043)]
sdc01_side01_020_brother_15	It was strong...and cool...and it didn’t even care\nwhen everyone shunned it...\c\nI’ve always wanted to be like that, ever since I\nwas a kid.[VAR 0114(0043)]
sdc01_side01_020_brother_33	I want to be as cool as the ogre.[VAR 0114(0043)]
sdc01_side01_020_brother_34	My sis sorta ends up doin’ everything for me...\neven when we’re at school...[VAR 0114(0043)]
sdc01_side01_020_brother_35	I...wanna try to get stronger. So I can do things\nfor myself, you know?[VAR 0114(0043)]
sdc01_side01_020_brother_36	I’m gonna become someone people can rely on.\nThen, just maybe...I could be that ogre’s friend.[VAR 0114(0043)]
sdc01_side01_020_brother_16	Oh! Um...right. Picture. We’re s’posed to take\na picture![VAR 0114(0043)]
sdc01_side01_020_brother_17	You can take the next one, too, if you don’t mind,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]...[VAR 0114(0043)]
sdc01_side01_020_brother_18	Phew. I knew it was the right call to let you\nhandle it, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0043)]
sdc01_side01_020_brother_37	Now, on to the next signboard...[VAR 0114(0043)]
sdc01_side01_020_brother_38	Oh. And you know the mountain the stories say\nthe ogre lives on? It’s actually Oni Mountain.\r\nYou can climb it from the stairs over there.[VAR 0114(0043)]
sdc01_side01_020_brother_39	If you wanted, we could...go see the ogre’s\nhome? Folks call it the [VAR FF00(0006)]Dreaded Den[VAR FF00(0000)].[VAR 0114(0043)]
sdc01_side01_020_select_07	I wanna see it!
sdc01_side01_020_select_08	Hmm, I dunno...
sdc01_side01_020_brother_40	Y-yes! I really...wanted you to see it for yourself,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0043)]

sdc01_side01_020_brother_42	So...if you keep climbing up, you’ll reach the\nInfernal Pass. There’s a sign before that... If you\r\nturn at the sign, you can get to the Dreaded Den.[VAR 0114(0043)]
sdc01_side01_020_brother_43	S-so I’ll just head on up, then. Come along when\nyou’re ready. An’ be careful![VAR 0114(0043)]

sdc01_side01_030_brother_02	According to the old legends, the ogre used to\nbe seen around here lots.[VAR 0114(0043)]
sdc01_side01_030_brother_03	Hey, before we check out the sign...could you...\nbattle me...?[VAR 0114(0043)]
sdc01_side01_030_select_01	Let’s do it!
sdc01_side01_030_select_02	I dunno...

sdc01_side01_030_brother_09	We should go check out the sign... Come on, let’s\nget this over with.[VAR 0114(0043)]
sdc01_side01_030_system_01	If you see a shadowy figure approaching you\noutside the village at twilight, be wary.
sdc01_side01_030_system_02	Don a mask at once, and hide your face.
sdc01_side01_030_system_03	Do so, and whether the shadow is man or monster,\nyou will pass each other by as fellow mask wearers.
sdc01_side01_030_system_04	If you should meet the shadow when you have no\nmask in hand, then pray that it is only a man.
sdc01_side01_030_system_05	If it is, you will live to see another day, and you\nwill remember to never forget your mask again.
sdc01_side01_030_system_06	But if it is the ogre, you will meet your end, as do\nall humans whose faces are seen by it.
sdc01_side01_030_system_07	Once it sees your face, your soul will be forfeit.\nAnd you shall never return to the village.
sdc01_side01_030_brother_18	In the old days, everyone carried masks wherever\nthey went. And...the one who made those masks\r\nwas actually my great-great-great-grandpa’s\r\ngreat-great-great-grandpa...or something.[VAR 0114(0043)]
sdc01_side01_030_brother_19	That’s amazing!
sdc01_side01_030_brother_20	So the stories are true?!
sdc01_side01_030_brother_21	I mean, I don’t think any of that stuff about the\nogre stealing souls is true or anything, but...\r\nit is true that our family used to make masks.[VAR 0114(0043)]
sdc01_side01_030_brother_22	Our family...has a long line of mask makers.\nEven my gramps can make ’em.[VAR 0114(0043)]
sdc01_side01_030_brother_23	I even heard that the reason we hold the Festival\nof Masks is ’cause our ancestors came up with\r\nthe idea.[VAR 0114(0043)]
sdc01_side01_030_brother_10	But I don’t really like what they wrote on this\nsign here...[VAR 0114(0043)]
sdc01_side01_030_brother_24	Just because the ogre seemed sorta scary,\neveryone got all afraid of it and drove it away\r\nfrom the village...[VAR 0114(0043)]
sdc01_side01_030_brother_11	But I’m pretty sure the ogre must’ve been lonely\non its own.[VAR 0114(0043)]
sdc01_side01_030_brother_25	Left all alone like that... Treated like some kind\nof outcast...[VAR 0114(0043)]

sdc01_side01_030_brother_15	Well, we’re all done with our assignment now.[VAR 0114(0043)]
sdc01_side01_030_brother_16	But I’ve gotta get stronger with my Pokémon...[VAR 0114(0043)]

sub_043_picnicnpc_07_03	Ahhh, a lakeside picnic! Nothing better! Care to\nrest up?

t05_82	More junk mail! Ugh!\c\nMaybe I’ll just crumple it all up into a ball that I\ncan throw around with my Pokémon...
t05_83	These big, long metal box things here are what\nwe call shipping containers.\c\nWe pack ’em full of goods and things to sell,\nthen ship ’em off across the sea.
t05_85	To get to other regions, we go by boat! Our\npoor Pokémon couldn’t carry us that far.
t05_86	I swam to those rocks out in the water, and I’m\npretty sure I spotted something on top of them.\c\nBut I don’t know how to get up there... I’m no\npro at climbing cliffs or anything...

t05_96	Ol’ man Kofu from the Cascarrafa Gym drops by\nthe market from time to time.\c\nThat old coot gets so excited whenever he wins\nat the auction that he dances a merry little jig!
t05_97	When I was younger, I got into my fair share of\nbidding wars and brawls both. I was a real spitfire!

t06_79	How about a sandwich? They’re tempting even\nwhen you’re full—that’s how good they are!
t06_101	Before climbing Glaseado Mountain, I like to\nvisit the shopping area in Medali and fuel up\r\nwith something to eat.
t06_106	This town is an important hub here in Paldea.\c\nLots of people from other places come through,\nso naturally, lots of restaurants have popped up.
t06_107	My little Greedent here has gotten bigger\nrecently. I wonder if it’s about time to move to a\r\nbigger living space...
t06_109	The way up Glaseado Mountain is rough! Be sure\nyou’re prepared if you’re headed out that way.
t06_115	This town doesn’t have a battle court, y’know?\nI wonder where you battle the Gym Leader...
t06_117	Long ago, the space at the bottom of these stairs\nwas a stage for plays and concerts.
t06_133	Hello there, young’un. Are you a student? The\nTreasure Hunt’s rolled around again, then, eh?

t07_01	Welcome to Zapapico! It’s a mining town, full of\nhardworking folks.
t07_06	Sure, big cities are fun to go visit, but plain little\ntowns like this one have their own charm!
t07_07	The name Zapapico comes from a word for a\npickaxe. Fitting for a town of mostly miners, no?
t07_09	Nothing like finding a bench when you really\nneed one! You’ll understand when you’re older.
t07_11	I saw this Pokémon in the mine that was so big,\nit was like a mountain!
t07_12	Well, I saw a Pokémon so long it was like a river!
t07_16	Phanpy’s a Ground type! It’s resistant to poison,\nand it shrugs off electricity altogether!\c\nJust, um, don’t pour water on it.
t07_31	My buddies and I battle our Pokémon on that\ncourt on our way home from work.
t07_36	My job would be a lot harder without my dear\nCarkol around!\c\nBy that, I mean it provides moral support, not\njust manual labor...although it helps with that too.
t07_42	Once, I was on the verge of fainting a little ways\noutside town, when a wild Pokémon Center lady\r\nappeared and came to my rescue!
t07_taxi	Flying Taxi here! Take a ride through the sky,\npowered by Squawkabilly!\c\nNeed a lift? Just open your map app and give us\na call. We’ll pick you up practically anywhere!

t08_01	Montenevera is a town with lotsa snow and lost\nsouls. But lately, the concerts are a real draw too!
t08_02	The fluttering snow! The flickering candlelight!\nEvery day is like a festival here! Don’t you think?
t08_06	The Snow Slope Run is popular these days. You\ncan try it out on Glaseado Mountain!
t08_08	Isn’t Snorunt cute? Only the females have a\nchance of evolving into Froslass.
t08_20	It’s cold again today. I’ll have something spicy to\neat to warm me up!
t08_22	Do you know about the ultimate class of\nsandwiches? They’re called “Master” sandwiches,\r\nand no one seems to know the recipes for them.
t08_23	Everything tastes better when you eat outside!
t08_26	The Gym Leader here used to be Tyme, but she\nretired a year and a half ago. Her sister Ryme is\r\nthe Gym Leader now.
t08_28	Have you ever seen one of Ryme’s concerts? Her\nmusic shakes you right down to your soul!
t08_29	The stage lights up purple for the Gym Test! It’s\nso pretty!

t09_01	Welcome to Alfornada, a town where you can\nsee the stars and find excellent pottery.
t09_02	My family’s been making pottery for generations!\nIsn’t that cool?
t09_03	The water’s trickling out...\c\nI wish it’d shoot out like Hydro Pump, though.\nWouldn’t that be neat?
t09_05	This plate’s huuuge! How big of a sandwich d’you\nthink would fit on it?
t09_06	Tableware made in Alfornada is popular all\nacross Paldea!
t09_07	Pottery is born from the kiln!\c\nPotters put shaped clay inside and let it fire nice\nand slow for days.
t09_19	The battle court here was originally built as an\nobservatory to view the stars.
t09_23	There was a Pokémon that reminded me of tea\nup the hilly road ahead here.
t09_24	Wasn’t it rough coming all the way out to\nAlfornada?\c\nBut now that you’ve been here once, you can use\nthe Flying Taxi to come back whenever you want.
t09_30	Alfornada is in such an inconvenient location!\nHaving a trusty Cyclizar is an absolute must here.
t09_40	I actually came to see the Gym Leader, Tulip. But\nthese plates are super cute too!
t09_43	The Pokémon mosaic art on the observatory is\nreally cute, isn’t it?\c\nIt reminds me of some kind of old video game!

t10_orien_01_01	Welcome to Mossui Town! We’re known for our\napples and for the natural beauty all around us!
t10_orien_05_01	You’re here on some kind of school field trip, eh?\nNo wonder you kids didn’t look familiar!
t10_orien_07_01	Are the festival preparations going OK? We’re\nstarting to fall behind on our merch deliveries...
t10_orien_08_01	I’ve been perfecting my fried noodle recipe by\npracticing at home every day!
t10_orien_09_01	Peachy’s is such a handy shop to have around!\c\nSure, they’ve got all your item needs covered.\nBut more importantly, the little old lady who runs\r\nthe place knits THE warmest socks ever!
t10_orien_11_01	Kitakami Hall is just up this hill!\c\nWell, I guess it’s more of a mountain...but\nwhatever you call it, it’s all uphill from here!
t10_orien_14_01	Looking at Poliwag’s belly makes me dizzy!
t10_orien_23_01	Carmine and Kieran both got into a school in\nsome far-off region!
t10_orien_24_01	Is it true? Are those rowdy siblings back in town?
t10_orien_28_01	Once the rice fields turn nice and golden, they’ll\nbe ready for harvesting!
t10_orien_32_01	Let me get this straight—you put rice IN your\nsandwiches? Don’t see that around Kitakami...
t10_orien_34_01	Not a whole lot going on in this town, is there?\nThat’s exactly what I like about it!
t10_matsuri_01_01	This is Mossui Town, known far and wide for its\nFestival of Masks!
t10_matsuri_05_01	The local youth group is pitching in to make the\nfestivities extra special. We hope you have fun!
t10_matsuri_05_02	I saw the Loyal Three chowing down on mochi at\nKitakami Hall!
t10_matsuri_05_03	I heard some kid became friends with Ogerpon!\nI’ll bet it was Kieran.
t10_matsuri_07_01	I love Okidogi! So green. So cool!
t10_matsuri_07_02	I got to see Okidogi! The real one wasn’t as\ngreen as the Okidogi masks, though.
t10_matsuri_07_03	The real Ogerpon’s mask looks just like the masks\nthey sell at the festival—super green!
t10_matsuri_11_01	You know those candy apples they sell during the\nfestival?\c\nThey’re made using ingredients picked fresh from\nthe Apple Hills!
t10_matsuri_15_01	Which came first: the festival or the masks?

team_0150.dat
team_0150_botan_01	[VAR BD06(0000)]Thanks for everything, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nAnd\r\nyou\r\ntoo, Clive...[VAR 0114(0008)]
team_0150_nelke_01	I’m glad I could see this through to the end.[VAR 0114(001E)]
team_0150_botan_02	I guess this is it for Team Star...and me, too—[VAR 0114(0008)]
team_0150_nelke_02	Hold that thought, Mis— Ah...Penny! I’d like to\ncheck something with you first.[VAR 0114(001E)]
team_0150_botan_03	Check...what?[VAR 0114(0008)]
team_0150_nelke_03	Why resort to something like Operation Starfall\nif you’re the big boss of Team Star?\c\nWasn’t there any other way to handle this?[VAR 0114(001E)]
team_0150_botan_04	I tried telling the bosses that we were done once\nbefore. But they still didn’t quit...[VAR 0114(0008)]
team_0150_nelke_04	Why not simply order them to?[VAR 0114(001E)]
team_0150_botan_05	Our code states that no one in the team has the\nright to order people around. I could ask them\r\nall to do stuff, but I could never order them.[VAR 0114(0008)]
team_0150_nelke_05	So, it’s back to the code once again... The bosses\nmust’ve taken it very seriously.[VAR 0114(001E)]
team_0150_botan_06	They did. That’s why I knew I could use it to force\nTeam Star to disband.[VAR 0114(0008)]
team_0150_nelke_06	Because the bosses would do anything the code\nrequired of them? Even leave the team?[VAR 0114(001E)]
team_0150_botan_07	Yes... And according to the code, they had to\naccept any challenge made to them.[VAR 0114(0008)]
team_0150_nelke_07	Thus the idea for Operation Starfall...[VAR 0114(001E)]
team_0150_nelke_08	Cassiopeia. Let me ask you one last thing.[VAR 0114(001E)]
team_0150_nelke_09	What does Team Star— No, what do your friends\nin the team mean to you?[VAR 0114(001E)]
team_0150_botan_08	... ... ...\nThey’re...[VAR 0114(0008)]
team_0150_botan_09	They’re my greatest treasure.[VAR 0114(0008)]
team_0150_nelke_10	Splendid. Thank you for apprising me of the\nsituation, Miss Penny.[VAR 0114(001E)]
team_0150_botan_10	Wha—?[VAR 0114(0008)]
team_0150_nelke_11	Now, young lady, there’s something I should very\nmuch like to discuss with you.[VAR 0114(001E)]
team_0150_botan_11	Hey, quit it with the old geezer act, Clive!\nYou’re creeping me out...[VAR 0114(0008)]

team_0150_nelke_13	Ha-hah![VAR 0114(001E)]
team_0150_botan_12	D-Director Clavell?![VAR 0114(0008)]
team_0150_nelke_14	Just as Cassiopeia was your disguise, the boy\nyou knew as Clive was mine![VAR 0114(000A)]

team_0150_nelke_15	[~]
team_0150_nelke_16	I needed a way to talk to Team Star on\nequal terms.[VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0150_nelke_17	Students do tend to shy from speaking their mind\nto their teachers, after all... Much more so when\r\nfaced with the director of the academy.[VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0150_botan_14	Yeah, but...where do I even start? Wasn’t the\noutfit a bit much?\c\nPlus I have some big feelings about that wig...[VAR 0114(0008)]
team_0150_nelke_18	Ahem! Well, that’s quite enough of that for now.\c\nEveryone! Why don’t you come on out?[VAR 0114(000A)]

team_0160.dat
team_0160_head_teacher_01	Now then, Miss Penny—and each of you young\nbosses, as well.[VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0160_head_teacher_02	On behalf of the academy, I have something I\nwould like to say to Team Star.[VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0160_head_teacher_03	You all have...my sincerest apologies.[VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0160_botan_01	...Come again?[VAR 0114(0008)]
team_0160_head_teacher_04	As director of the academy, I let you down. My\nhandling of your situation was a dismal failure...[VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0160_botan_02	Wha—? I still don’t... I mean... Why?[VAR 0114(0008)]
team_0160_head_teacher_05	You all told me about your reasons for forming\nTeam Star and about your subsequent actions.[VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0160_head_teacher_06	Ever since my first days as director, all I’ve ever\nexperienced of the academy is an environment\r\nblessedly free from bullying.[VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0160_head_teacher_07	But I now know this peace was built on the backs\nof your hurt and anger—and, of course, your\r\nimmense courage in putting things to right.[VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0160_head_teacher_08	And so, I’ll get straight to the conclusion.[VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0160_head_teacher_09	The academy’s order for Team Star to disband\nand my threat to expel those who did not obey...\r\nare hereby revoked![VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0160_aku_03	Does that mean what I think it means...?[VAR 0114(0021)]
team_0160_head_teacher_10	Indeed! Team Star can continue to exist, should\nthat be your wish![VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0160_kakutou_03	Woo-hoo! Penny, isn’t this great? Now we can all\nstay together![VAR 0114(0022)]
team_0160_doku_03	O, mine heart is giddy with glee![VAR 0114(0023)]
team_0160_botan_03	B-but...I betrayed all of you...[VAR 0114(0008)]
team_0160_fairy_01	You mean Operation Starfall? Director Clavell\ntold us all about it![VAR 0114(0020)]
team_0160_aku_01	Far as we heard, you only went through with it\nto save us from getting expelled!\c\nYou were just worried about us, right?[VAR 0114(0021)]
team_0160_honoo_01	Not like we’d ever chuck the team just ’cause\nsomeone told us to, after all. Ain’t our style.[VAR 0114(001F)]
team_0160_doku_01	I cannot even begin to imagine how you must\nhave fear’d for us, Lady Penny...[VAR 0114(0023)]
team_0160_kakutou_01	Sorry for making you worry, B.B. We’re all\nOK now.[VAR 0114(0022)]
team_0160_botan_04	But—! Even so...[VAR 0114(0008)]
team_0160_head_teacher_11	Hold on, everyone. I’ve more to say.[VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0160_head_teacher_12	As previously stated, the requirement for Team\nStar to disband has been revoked.[VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0160_head_teacher_13	However! There are still some unsettled matters\nto discuss. Allow me to provide a few examples...[VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0160_head_teacher_14	Your protracted truancy! Your brazen\ncustomization of school uniforms![VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0160_head_teacher_26	Your unauthorized usage of academy equipment![VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0160_head_teacher_27	Your reckless modification and jeopardous\ndriving of Pokémon-powered vehicles![VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0160_head_teacher_28	Need I go on? Your flagrant disregard for school\nrules cannot simply be overlooked![VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0160_head_teacher_15	Thus, as punishment, you will all be required to\nengage in community service.[VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0160_botan_05	Community...service?[VAR 0114(0008)]
team_0160_head_teacher_16	Yes. Specifically, I will be asking you to manage\nthe STCs.[VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0160_botan_06	Aaand that stands for...?[VAR 0114(0008)]
team_0160_head_teacher_17	The Star Training Centers![VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0160_head_teacher_18	They shall be facilities for cultivating Pokémon\nTrainers’ talents. I plan for the academy to found\r\nthem in collaboration with the Pokémon League.[VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0160_head_teacher_19	[VAR BD06(0000)]The idea came to me when I saw M[VAR 1100(00FF,0305)]asteriss\n[VAR 0100(0000)]\r\nbattling\r\nh[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]iser\r\nway\r\nthrough\r\nyour bases.[VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0160_head_teacher_20	The bases’ construction, as well as the battle\ntactics employed by the students in Team Star,\r\nare remarkably unique and creative![VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0160_head_teacher_21	I would ask that you continue your team activities\nbut henceforth as STC staff members, using your\r\nformer bases as training facilities.[VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0160_head_teacher_22	And that is the sum of it. Does anyone have\nany concerns?[VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0160_botan_07	Um...no? It sounds like fun, so I don’t see how\nthis’d be anything but a win-win...[VAR 0114(0008)]
team_0160_fairy_02	This may be a weird thing to say since the STCs\nare supposed to be a punishment and all, but\r\nyou should totally join in too, Penny![VAR 0114(0020)]
team_0160_doku_02	’Tis true... We would most happily have you at\nour sides, my lady.[VAR 0114(0023)]
team_0160_kakutou_02	We can go to school together too! That way if\nanything happens, we’ll be there to protect you![VAR 0114(0022)]
team_0160_aku_02	We were already talkin’ about how great it’d be\nto have both Team Star and school in our lives.\r\nThis’d be a sweet deal for us![VAR 0114(0021)]
team_0160_honoo_02	So, whaddya say...?[VAR 0114(001F)]
team_0160_botan_08	You guys...[VAR 0114(0008)]
team_0160_botan_09	[VAR 0100(0000)]...what do you think?[VAR 0114(0008)]

team_0160_select_02	Give it your best!
team_0160_botan_10	Huh? B-but—! Ummm... I just...[VAR 0114(0008)]
team_0160_head_teacher_23	No need to give your response right this moment,\nMiss Penny. Do take some time to decide.[VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0160_head_teacher_24	For now, at least, I think our little group should\ngo their separate ways.\c\nAh. Not to say you should break up Team Star\nafter all! I simply meant it is time to leave.[VAR 0114(000A)]

team_0170_head_teacher_09	Why so? Because of Operation Starfall?[VAR 0114(000A)]
team_0170_botan_03	No, not that. Because of the other really bad\nthing I did...[VAR 0114(0008)]
