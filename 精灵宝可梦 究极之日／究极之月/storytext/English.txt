64	Welcome to the Battle Agency reception desk.\nNot to brag, but this facility is pretty sweet...
65	First, go ahead and borrow a Pokémon at the\nreception desk.
66	You can choose one of three Pokémon.
67	Once you’ve borrowed a Pokémon, next is\nasking Trainers to join your team.
68	Look for Trainers who have strong Pokémon.
69	Battle alongside your teammates and\nget rewards!
70	If you keep winning, your grade will go up.
71	If your grade goes up, you can battle with\nstronger Pokémon!
72	Battle a lot and raise your grade.
73	That’s how it works.\nGo ahead and give it a try.
74	Back
75	Battle preparation
76	All right. Let’s move on to battle preparation.
77	You don’t have enough teammates.\nPlease ask some Trainers to be your teammates.
78	Would you like to prepare for your battles?\nWhat would you like to do?
79	Would you like to select this Pokémon?
80	It seems there are no Trainers you can ask\nto be your teammates yet.\c\nTo ask Trainers to be your teammates, please\nuse StreetPass.
81	I’ll give you Festival Coins to commemorate your\nvictory against Trainers.
82	Please take this.
83	Oh!! Who are you?\nI’ll beat you![VAR 0114(0033)]
84	You’ve come a long way...\nIt’s time for me to get serious![VAR 0114(0010)]
85	... ... ...\n... ... ...[VAR 0114(0020)]
86	[VAR 0100(0000)], your grade will go up with\n[VAR 0200(0001)] more successful challenge[VAR 1101(0001,0100)]s.
87	You’re currently in the middle of your challenge\nat the Battle Agency.\c\nA boss will appear if you have [VAR 0200(0000)] more\nsuccessful challenge[VAR 1101(0000,0100)]s.
88	A boss will appear if you have\n[VAR 0200(0000)] more successful challenge[VAR 1101(0000,0100)]s.
89	You’ve reached grade 50 and cleared the\nBattle Agency! Congratulations!\c\nFrom now on, for every five successful\nchallenges, you’ll receive a reward.
90	Pokémon have type matchups.\c\nIt’s a shortcut to victory to know which type\nyour Pokémon is weak against or strong against.
91	It’s also effective to swap Pokémon in or out\nduring a battle.\c\nIf your Pokémon is weak to the opposing\nPokémon, swapping it out can be advantageous.
92	Do you check your Pokémon’s Ability?\c\nAbilities may be different even among the\nsame species of Pokémon.
93	Sometimes defense is more important\nthan offense.\c\nMoves that change statuses are also useful.
94	You might want to consider swapping out your\nPokémon if you think the opposing Pokémon\r\ncould use a supereffective move against it.
95	Do you pay attention to changes in the\nopposing Pokémon’s stats?\c\nTouch the icon of the Pokémon, and you can\nsee its stat changes.
96	You should check if your Pokémon is good at\nphysical attacks or special attacks.\c\nIt may be effective to use physical moves on\na Pokémon that seems to be strong against\r\nspecial attacks.
97	Even if the power of two moves is the same,\nif one move’s type is the same as the\r\nPokémon’s type, it will be more powerful than\r\na move of a different type.
98	If your Pokémon’s Speed stat is higher than\nthe opponent’s, your Pokémon can use a move\r\nbefore the opponent.\c\nIt may be a good idea to compare Speed and\ncreate a strategy.
99	If your Pokémon in battle doesn’t have a\nsupereffective move, why don’t you swap it\r\nout for another Pokémon?
100	Last but not least, we request that you project\nthe proper look as an agent at the\r\nBattle Agency. Good luck!
101	Your grade is now [VAR 0201(0000)].\nCongratulations!\c\nI’d like to give you something.\nI’m pretty sure they’ll look cool on you.
102	You received Agent Sunglasses.
103	Installing a battle program...\nType “[VAR 010E(0000)].”
104	Installing a battle program...\nType “[VAR 0100(0000)].”
105	Next, please ask other Trainers to join your\nteam to battle with you.
106	Next is to ask other Trainers to join your team\nto battle with you, but you don’t seem to know\r\nTrainers who you can ask to join your team.\c\nTo ask Trainers to be your teammates, please\nuse StreetPass.
107	Please select Challenge to start your challenge,\nM[VAR 1100(0000,0101)]rs. [VAR 0100(0000)].
108	You succeeded in your challenge!\c\nYour talent as an agent has been recognized,\nand you have received a grade.\c\nWe hope for your further success!
109	Since your grade is now [VAR 0201(0000)], a battle setting to\nfurther test your ability as an agent will appear.\c\nThat means a weather effect or a field effect\nwill be added at the beginning of a battle.\c\nCreate a battle strategy by selecting Pokémon\nwith certain types or moves, depending on the\r\nbattle setting.\c\nReselecting Pokémon at an exchange center—\nSwitcheroo in Festival Plaza—is effective.
110	There is no battle setting today.

0	Welcome to the Battle Tree. I’m the receptionist.
1	How can I help you?
2	What would you like to hear about?
3	You can enjoy various kinds of battles with\nmany different Trainers here.\c\nYou can choose either Single Battles, Double\nBattles, or Multi Battles.\c\nYou’ll be competing to see how many Trainers\nyou can win your way through in a row.\c\nIf you lose even once, your win streak will\nend there. You’ll have to start over from zero,\r\nso please be careful.\c\nThere are two courses in the Battle Tree—\nNormal Course and Super Course.\c\nIf you clear the Normal Course, the Super\nCourse will become available.\c\nEach time you defeat a Trainer you’ll receive\nBattle Points, or BP, that you can use to scout\r\nTrainers or exchange for prizes.\c\nThe longer your win streak, the more BP\nyou’ll receive.\c\nDo your best to set an awesome record!
4	There are three important points you need to\nkeep in mind to battle at the Battle Tree.\c\nFirst, some Pokémon are not allowed in the\nSuper Course while all Pokémon are\r\nallowed in the Normal Course. Battles in the\r\nSuper Course are held under Flat Rules.\c\nAny Pokémon higher than Lv. 50 will have\ntheir level lowered to 50.\c\nSecond, you’ll need a certain number of\nPokémon for your battles.\c\nYou’ll need three for Single Battles, four for\nDouble Battles, and for Multi Battles, each\r\nTrainer will need two.\c\nAnd the last thing, you can’t use more than one\nof the same Pokémon or item in your battles.\c\nHowever, if your partner in a Multi Battle has\nthe same Pokémon or item as you, that’s not\r\na problem.
5	We hope to see you again.

1	Welcome to the Battle Royal!\nWe welcome you, Champion!
2	Would you like to have a Battle Royal?
3	What rank will you enter as?
4	Would you like to take part in a Hyper Rank\nBattle Royal match?
5	Would you like to take part in a Master Rank\nBattle Royal match?
6	A Pokémon Battle Royal takes part between four\nTrainers, who each bring three Pokémon into the\r\nring for a four-way free-for-all!\c\nEvery other Trainer in the ring is an opponent,\nand the goal of each match is to win your way\r\nthrough to victory against them all.\c\nOnce any of the participating Trainers have all\nthree of their Pokémon faint and can no longer\r\nbattle, the match ends.\c\nWhichever Trainer is in first place at the point\nwhen the battle ends will be the winner.\c\nPlaces are decided by how many Pokémon\nyou’ve defeated and how many you have left.\c\nYou score higher by defeating more Pokémon\nand having fewer Pokémon on your team faint.\c\nIf you tie with another Trainer based on these\ntwo factors, then the one who defeated more\r\nPokémon will be declared the winner.\c\nIf it’s still a tie, then whoever has the most\nnet HP left will be declared the winner.\c\nTry your best to knock out as many other\nPokémon as possible while keeping your\r\nPokémon from fainting!\c\nBattle Royals are sorted into four ranks: Normal,\nSuper, Hyper, and Master. Once you clear a\r\nrank, you can try the next rank.\c\nIn the Normal Rank, any Pokémon higher than\nLv. 30 will have their level lowered to Lv. 30,\r\nand in the other ranks, any Pokémon higher\r\nthan Lv. 50 will have their level lowered to\r\nLv. 50, so be careful.\c\nNow that we’ve reviewed all that, let me ask\nyou once again...
7	Then please select the Pokémon you would\nlike to battle with.
8	I am the Masked Royal!\c\nI heard about your efforts here at the Battle\nDome, and it made me want to battle you!\r\nLet’s do this. Woo!
9	It looks like you’re all ready for battle.\nThen please come this way.
10	Then we hope you’ll come back again!
11	Good effort today!
12	Congratulations on your win!\c\nYou tried really hard today, [VAR 0189(0000)].\nYou and [VAR 0102(0001)] both!
13	You’ll be promoted up to Super Rank for your\nnext battle, [VAR 0189(0000)]!
14	You’ll be promoted up to Hyper Rank for your\nnext battle, [VAR 0189(0000)]!
15	You’ll be promoted up to Master Rank for your\nnext battle, [VAR 0189(0000)]!
16	Now that you’ve won a Master Rank match,\nI’ll present you with a special stamp!
17	Please accept your BP from the battle.
18	You received [VAR 0200(0001)] BP!
19	We look forward to your next Battle Royal!

21	I’ll participate

2	On How to Heal Your Pokémon\nWhen your Pokémon are injured or suffering \nfrom some status condition, either get them to\na Pokémon Center or use the appropriate \nmedicines on them!
3	On How to Trigger Abilities\nMethod 1: An Ability may be triggered when the\nPokémon appears in a battle, and its effects will\nthen continue as long as that Pokémon remains\nin the battle.\c\nMethod 2: An Ability may be triggered when the\nPokémon takes an attack from an opponent.\n\nMethod 3: An Ability may be triggered when the\nPokémon is not in a Pokémon battle.
4	On the Origins of the Alola Region\nThe islands of Alola were given form when\nunderwater volcanoes erupted long, long ago.\nPokémon came to live in Alola when they flew,\nswam, or were carried on the wind to the isles.
5	On the Number of Pokémon Moves\nAs of this writing, scholars in this field have\nidentified more than 600 distinct moves that\ncan be used by Pokémon in battle.\c\nYet each Pokémon is only able to remember\na maximum of four moves at a time.\nTo learn a fifth move, it must forget one of the\nother moves that it knows.\c\nAdditionally, it must be noted that there are\nalso many different ways through which\nPokémon are able to learn moves.\nThere is still much for us to learn about the\nrelationship of Pokémon and their moves.
6	On the Classification of Pokémon Moves\nPokémon moves can be divided into three broad\ncategories: physical moves, special moves, and\nof course status moves.\c\nPHYSICAL MOVES\nMoves that attack an opponent, dealing damage\nbased upon the Attack stat of the Pokémon\nusing the move and the Defense stat of the\nPokémon on the receiving side.\c\nSPECIAL MOVES\nMoves that attack an opponent, dealing damage\nbased upon the Sp. Attack stat of the Pokémon\nusing the move and the Sp. Defense stat of the\nPokémon on the receiving side.\c\nSTATUS MOVES\nMoves that have effects other than directly\nattacking another target in battle.

0	Welcome to the Pokémon Center Café!\nIt’s about [VAR 0201(0000)]:00 now in Alola.\c\nHere in our café space, we provide a moment of\npeace to our customers.
1	Please come visit us again soon!
2	What can I get started for you today?
3	Lemonade
4	Tapu Cocoa
5	Moomoo Milk
6	Pinap Juice
7	Roserade Tea
8	Komala Coffee
9	A [VAR 01C2(0002)] will be $[VAR 0202(0001)].\nWill that be all right?
10	This is our café’s original blend, made with\nplenty of freshly picked Alolan Berries.\c\nIts intensely sweet flavor will linger on\npleasantly for hours.
11	Just one sip and you’ll be hooked.\c\nThis milk is so mellow, yet rich, that it’ll \nmake you wish your mother were a Miltank.
12	Please enjoy the harmonious tones of sweet\nand sour that can only be performed by Pinap\r\ngrown under the Alolan sun.
13	We’ve mixed up all different kinds of Berries to\nmake this special Lemonade!\c\nThe refreshing sweetness of it might just\nswallow you!
14	Moomoo Milk!\c\nGulping it down will bring a smile to your face\nand your heart!
15	This highly aromatic tea is made with extracts\nfrom Roserade’s favorite leaves.\c\nWhen you drink it, you may find yourself wanting\nto Petal Dance.
16	Never mind
17	When your adventures have tired you out,\nit’s time to relax with a hot cup of Tapu Cocoa.\r\nYou’ll love it iced, too.
18	Pinap Berries don’t deal well with wind or cold.\nHere in the Alola region, however, they can grow\r\nto their full potential under the Alolan sun.\c\nMeaning they’re really delicious.
19	Enjoy this mellow tea made from the Pokémon \nRoserade’s favorite leaves which we\r\nhave fermented.
20	This Lemonade is made artisanally by hand, so it\nmust be better than what you get out of a\r\nvending machine.\c\nIt is, right?
21	Chocolate cream...\c\nTapu Cocoa is so good it’ll make you\ncompletely forget about counting calories!\c\nMaybe I’ll stop worrying about my blood sugar\nlevel and have some, too.
22	Don’t you think sour juice makes your body\nfeel great?\c\nOf course it’s just a feeling, but I guarantee\nthe taste.
23	Such a rich and mellow flavor...\c\nTapu Cocoa makes you feel so warm inside,\nit’s as if the tapu are watching over you.
24	You try to stay cool when you taste the\nspiciness, and you try to act strong when the\r\nsourness hits you.\c\nTry gulping down a glass of Pinap Juice\nlike that!
25	Coffee from Alola is famous all over the world.\c\nEven the timid Pokémon Granbull, with its scary\nface, can’t help but smile when it drinks some.
26	Drinking Tapu Cocoa improves your\ncirculation, allowing you to feel more relaxed.\c\nMixing in a little salt is also quite nice.
27	We’ve pressed the skins of Pinap Berries,\nfreshly picked on Akala, to make this juice.\c\nI ate all the flesh myself! It was crazy spicy!
28	The bitterness comes pouring out...\c\nJust one sip could knock you out like the\nPokémon Komala.
29	This Moomoo Milk is made with milk I\njust collected.\c\nAllow it to roll gently across your tongue as you\ndrink it.
30	When you peel a Pinap Berry, it’ll make your\nfingers tingle.\c\nBut I guarantee this juice is even better than\nthe Berry Juice that Shuckle make!
31	I became an apprentice to a mysterious barista\nand, after many struggles, I am finally allowed to\r\nbrew some coffee.\c\nWhat I have brewed is this mythical\nKomala Coffee.
32	We’ve crushed all kinds of Berries and mixed\nthem all up!\c\nHuzzah for you, who ordered this\nspecial Lemonade!
33	It’s good to gulp down fresh Moomoo Milk.
34	When you taste Roserade Tea, you’ll first notice\na Sweet Scent filling your nose.\c\nDrink it while it’s hot, before you miss out on\nthe fullness of its aroma!
35	Here in the Alola region we can harvest\nmany Berries, so we use over 50 kinds of\r\nBerries to make this.\c\nBut I’m actually too lazy to use so many, so I\njust throw in about 47.
36	This Tapu Cocoa is our specialty here.\c\nBy the way, did you know the English word\n“taboo” may have its origins here in Alola?\c\nBut I’m actually too lazy to check whether\nthat’s true or not, though.
37	You can get Moomoo Milk from Miltank.\c\nThis is just between you and me, but there’s a\nGym Leader named Whitney in Goldenrod City\r\nwith a Miltank.\c\nI heard that you can get some real tip-top\nMoomoo Milk from her Miltank. \c\nBut I’m actually too lazy to check whether\nthat’s true or not, though.
38	This is the finest Tapu Cocoa I have ever\nmade in my life. Please savor it.\c\nOf course I will continue to work hard to\nsurpass even this Tapu Cocoa.
39	In the old days Moomoo Milk was regarded as a\nhighly nutritious medicine.\c\nIf you drink two cups a day, other than the\noccasional tummy ache, you’ll be the picture\r\nof health!
40	In the old days Moomoo Milk was regarded as a\nhighly nutritious medicine.\c\nIf you drink two cups a day, other than the\noccasional tummy ache, you’ll be the picture\r\nof health!
41	I’ll be able to brew and offer you the finest\ncoffee only if I continue Pokémon battling and\r\nsurpass my master, a mysterious barista.
42	By using Berries that have become almost too\nripe to eat, our Lemonade here has a depth like\r\nnone other.\c\nWe’re quite proud of just how sour it is.
43	We had to battle Roserade to gather all the\nleaves for this tea.\c\nEnjoy it to your heart’s content. If you don’t, my\ngrandson who gathered the leaves will never\r\nfind peace.
44	We blend beans that we import from\na distant region.\c\nIn other words, you can experience not just one\nnovel flavor but several!\c\nIt might not actually be correct to call this\nKomala Coffee.
45	Got it! Then if you’ll just give me a moment...
46	Here you are!\c\nOne [VAR 01C2(0002)] just for you!
47	I’m sorry, but it looks like you don’t quite have\nenough this time.\c\nBut I really do appreciate how much you love\nour drinks, and I thank you for stopping by!
48	Here you are. This will make you feel better.
49	Here you are. This will clear your head.
50	Here you are. This will wake you up.
51	All the cool kids headed for their trial at\nBrooklet Hill are drinking Tapu Cocoa.\c\nAgainst Water-type Pokémon, Grass types and\nElectric types can attack efficiently.
52	All the cool kids headed for their trial at\nBrooklet Hill are drinking Moomoo Milk.\c\nAgainst Water-type Pokémon, Grass types and\nElectric types can attack efficiently.
53	All the cool kids headed for their trial at\nBrooklet Hill are drinking Pinap Juice.\c\nAgainst Water-type Pokémon, Grass types and\nElectric types can attack efficiently.
54	This is the best Moomoo Milk in all of Alola!\c\nI won’t bother you with all the details of\neverything it took to get it here to you, but try\r\nto imagine while you’re drinking it.\c\nBy the way, if you don’t finish it all, can I have\nthe rest?
55	I brew very strong Roserade Tea because if it\nwas weak, you wouldn’t get the stimulation you\r\nwant no matter how many cups you drink of it.\c\nIf you want to make it weaker, add Moomoo Milk\nlittle by little.
56	If you’re feeling comatose, it’s time for a\nKomala Coffee. The flavor’s still a work in\r\nprogress, though.\c\nThe water we get up here on the mountain is\ncold, so it’s hard to get the flavor right.
57	Did you know the “-ade” part of Lemonade\noriginally comes from the Kalos region?
58	This Tapu Cocoa has been prepared with\nplenty of Moomoo Milk to give it the richest\r\nflavor possible.
59	Drinking Roserade Tea up here near the stars...\nIsn’t the thought of it delicious?
60	This is a popular snack in Lumiose City in the\nKalos region.
61	This candy bar is a specialty from Mahogany\nTown in the Johto region.
62	This ice cream is a specialty from Castelia City\nin the Unova region.
63	This is authentic food from Eterna City in the\nSinnoh region.
64	This snack is a specialty of Shalour City in the\nKalos region.
65	These cookies are a specialty from Lavaridge\nTown in the Hoenn region.
66	This chocolate is just ridiculously sweet.
67	You’re limited to one per day, but have a tea\nbiscuit on us.
68	We’d like to offer your Pokémon something on\nthe house.
69	Poké Beans are a specialty in Alola, and\nPokémon love to eat them!\c\nFeed them to your Pokémon in Pokémon\nRefresh, and they’ll become more affectionate!
70	By the way, do you give your\nPokémon nicknames?\c\nYou know, no one can change those names\nbesides the Trainer who gave them to\r\nthe Pokémon.\c\nIf you trade a Pokémon away, it will always\nkeep the nickname you gave it.\c\nYou better think long and hard about what\nnicknames to give your Pokémon.
71	By the way, are you saving your progress?\c\nIt can be kind of a pain to save your progress\nsometimes.\c\nIt is important, though, so do try to save often.
72	By the way, are you going to Festival Plaza?\nYou can connect with other Trainers anytime!\c\nThere’s an exclamation symbol that lets you\nknow when events are going on, too.
73	By the way, are you going to the Poké Pelago?\c\nMy Pokémon are spending their days on an\nisland far away from me.\c\nI hope they’re having a good time out there...
74	By the way, are you using the Poké Finder?\c\nIt lets you capture all your\nunforgettable moments.\c\nIt’s so lovely that you can save all your precious\nmemories forever.
75	By the way, are you using Pokémon Refresh?\c\nWhen I catch new Pokémon, I make sure to\ntake really good care of them.\c\nIt bothers me when they get dirty in battles.\nI spend all my downtime taking care of them.
76	By the way, are you riding Stoutland?\c\nYou can find all kinds of stuff when you’re\nriding that Pokémon.\c\nI get so into it when I ride Stoutland that I\ncompletely lose track of time.
77	By the way, are you watching Battle Videos?\c\nI like battling, so I’m hooked on taking and\nwatching videos.\c\nI’ve stayed up all night doing it and been late to\nwork here before!
78	By the way, are you checking out your\nTrainer Passport?\c\nI get a bit wistful when I look at all the stamps\nI’ve gotten in mine.\c\nI guess I’m just the sentimental type.
79	By the way, are you using\nQuick Link?\c\nWhen you’ve got too many friends around, you\nmight not know who you’ll connect with.\c\nYou really can connect quickly, though, so it’s\nstill really convenient.
80	By the way, are you visiting the\nPokémon Nursery?\c\nWhen you drop off a male Pokémon and a female\nPokémon who get along well there for a while,\r\napparently sometimes you’ll find an Egg.
81	By the way, are you gathering Poké Beans?\c\nPeople give them to Pokémon or roast them\nand use them as coffee beans.\c\nThat’s a foodstuff that has a long history here\nin Alola.\c\nApparently the Poké Beans you can get from\nMohn’s Poké Pelago are the best these days.
82	When you get to be my age, it really makes you\nthink about things.\c\nThey say time is money, but time itself is\nactually really important.\c\nI mean, you can never buy more time for\nyourself with money, right?\c\nThe present is truly a present. Once it’s gone,\nyou can never get it back.
83	The reason I run a café is because everybody’s\nalways rushing around and busy these days.\c\nI hope people can come here and relax, even if\nit’s just for a little while.
84	These days you can easily communicate with\npeople all over the world.\c\nKeep in mind that there are time differences in\nthe world, though.\c\nWhat I mean to say is that it isn’t necessarily\nthe same time for you and whatever Trainer\r\nyou’re communicating with.\c\nDepending on what time you’re trying to\ncommunicate with other Trainers, you might find\r\nit easier to connect to Trainers from a\r\ncertain country.
85	Once time has passed you by, it will never come\nback. And no one is selling more time\r\nanywhere, either.\c\nThat’s what makes time so important for all\nof us.\c\nWhen you’re late for an appointment, it’s like\nyou’re stealing the other person’s time.\c\nI was often late for dates with my wife, so she\nused to give me an earful!
86	Time is the same for everyone.\c\nWhether you’re outside playing or laying around\nsleeping, time just keeps on flowing.\c\nHow you spend it is up to you. Remember that\ntime you enjoy wasting is not wasted time.
87	Vehicles sure are convenient.\c\nYou can get to where you’re going a whole lot\nfaster than if you had to walk everywhere.\c\nSo by convenient, I mean that they’ll save you a\nlot of time.
88	Each day the sun rises, filling the world\nwith light.\c\nEach of us grows big and strong, bathing in its\nlight so bright.\c\nEach night the moon rises and quietly\nshines down.\c\nEach of us wrapped in peaceful silence, not one\nheart with a frown.\c\nI wrote that poem myself. We take for granted\nthat the sun and the moon keep shining down\r\non us, but we shouldn’t forget to be grateful.
89	Long ago, months were decided by the moon,\nand days by the sun.\c\nThe sun and the moon have always been\nessential for our way of life.
90	The little planet we live on revolves around\nthe sun...\c\nAnd the moon revolves around our planet...\c\nHey, have you ever stopped to think about what\nit is your life revolves around?
91	By the way, are you using Festival Plaza?\c\nYou can connect with someone anytime and\nspend some time together.\c\nDon’t you think all the things you can do at\nFestival Plaza are miraculous?
92	You can have Pokémon battles with your friends\nor with people you don’t know.\c\nBattles can get so hot that you completely lose\ntrack of time.
93	Those who keep moving have more time than\nthose who don’t move at all.\c\nThat’s not some kind of riddle, it’s\nscientific fact.\c\nOnce I learned that, I started to more carefully\nconsider how I spend my time.
94	You got some Poké Beans!
95	Oh, you’ve given your Pokémon\n[VAR 0205(0000,002C)] Poké Bean[VAR 1101(0000,0100)]s.
96	Poké Beans make Pokémon happy. I think I’ll\ngive you a present!
97	Try giving your Pokémon some Poké Beans when\nyour island challenge gets rough.
98	That Alola Photo Club sure is something...\c\nPutting together the various poses and the\nhundreds of different Pokémon to come up\r\nwith the perfect photo...\c\nBoy, when you pull it off just right, it sure does\ngive you a sense of accomplishment!\c\nPlus, you’ve made yourself a memory with your\nPokémon that you can treasure forever, too.
99	So tell me, friend, what do you think of that\nMantine Surfing?\c\nSome people seem to see it as a bit of fun. And\nother people take it as seriously as any battle.\c\nEither way, facing off against the wild waves\nnature throws your way, with only the moves\r\nyou can pull off together with a Pokémon...\c\nThe scale of it simply takes my breath away!
100	The Battle Agency, huh...\c\nIt’s all a question of who you’re going to partner\nup with and which Pokémon you choose to use.\c\nFighting your way forward even in a situation\nthat you can’t fully control...\c\nWell, maybe I’m the only one who sees it as\na kind of metaphor for how you sometimes have\r\nto take fate head on in life and try to defy it.
101	Welcome to the Pokémon Center Café, Champ!\nIt’s about [VAR 0201(0000)]:00 now in Alola.\c\nHere in our café space, we provide a moment of\npeace to our customers.

19	Sorry! I can’t trade with a person who has only\none Pokémon.
20	Hello!\nYou’re a Pokémon Trainer, aren’t you?\c\nHave you caught Spearow?\nWill you trade it for my Hawlucha?

46	No, no, no! I have something I want to find out\nby trading Phantump for Phantump!
47	I’ll be waiting!

4	All right, here’s a lovely gift from me to help\nmake today special, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]

20	Let me see... So we open the X Menu by tapping\n and then select Save...\c\nAnd that’s how we can save our progress to\ncontinue again at any time, right?
21	It’s important to save your memories!\c\nYou can save them by jotting them down so\nthat you don’t forget what you’ve done.
22	Didja know? When a Rockruff really likes you,\nit rubs against you with the stones on its neck!\r\nBut...it does kinda hurt...
23	Little Hau is a sweet one, eh?\nNothing like his fearsome granddad, Hala!
24	If you treat your Pokémon wrong, the guardian\ndeity will strike you down with lightning!\r\nBut the children all laugh when I tell them that.
25	Both sides’ Pokémon will give it their all!
26	Pokémon have been there for me from the\nday I was born.\c\nI’d guess that Pokémon will keep being there\nfor me my whole life!
27	That Hau is the kahuna’s own grandson.\c\nBoy, I might just get my hopes up for this battle.\nI hope it’ll be a good one!
28	The tall grass is like a treasure trove, full of\nall kinds of Pokémon just waiting to be found!

1	Ho! Howzit, [VAR 0100(0000)]?\c\nMan, I thought you’d never make it!\nMe and [VAR 0101(0001)]’ve been waiting for ages![VAR 0114(0007)]
2	Hoo!
3	Grrr!
4	Arf!
5	Hold on...\nDidn’t anyone explain to you about tonight?![VAR 0114(0007)]
6	Oh yeah, right on time![VAR 0114(0005)]
7	But to what exactly?[VAR 0114(0006)]
8	Pew!
9	A full-powered festival for Pokémon battling!\c\nWe battle in the name of Tapu Koko, pitting our\nbest moves against one another in friendly\r\ncompetition to please our guardian. Woo![VAR 0114(0005)]
10	So, you two will be taking part in the battle?\c\nI don’t like seeing Pokémon fight one another,\nsince they so often end up getting hurt.\c\nBut...I’ll be sure to watch you both.[VAR 0114(0006)]
11	[~ 11]
12	Your Pokémon have fought for you, so show\nthem the same care in return, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nAllow me to heal them for you this time.[VAR 0114(0008)]
13	Are you ready for this Pokémon battle?[VAR 0114(0008)]
14	When you feel that you’re ready, come back\nand tell me.[VAR 0114(0008)]
15	Then let’s begin![VAR 0114(0008)]
64
0	For all life on our islands...[VAR 0114(0008)]
1	and for those who undertake the\nisland challenge with joy in their hearts...[VAR 0114(0008)]
2	we pray for your protection...\nfor them and all Melemele.[VAR 0114(0008)]
3	May this Pokémon battle be an offering to\nour island’s guardian deity—Tapu Koko![VAR 0114(0008)]
4	Before you stands Hau—grandson\nto the kahuna.[VAR 0114(0008)]
5	Let’s have fun with this, [VAR 0101(0001)]![VAR 0114(0007)]
6	Before him stands [VAR 0100(0000)]—\none who has met with Tapu Koko.[VAR 0114(0008)]
7	What?!
8	What a curious little thing Tapu Koko is!\nHah, that’s just typical of it!
9	[VAR 0101(0001)]!\nTake care of my little [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0004)]
10	As long as we both have a good time,\nthen I think we can call it a great battle, eh?[VAR 0114(0007)]
11	[VAR 0100(0000)]! Hau!\nBring forth the power of your Pokémon![VAR 0114(0008)]
12	Hoo-ee! Another great battle this year.
13	I bet Tapu Koko liked it, too.
14	Phew...\nThat was awesome, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0007)]
15	That was a really great battle!\nI had a blast fighting you![VAR 0114(0007)]
16	It was a good battle.\nWith this, even Tapu Koko...[VAR 0114(0008)]
17	Ko-ko-kooo!
18	Ho! You heard it yourself!\nTapu Koko’s song of approval.[VAR 0114(0008)]
19	Oh, I nearly forgot! I think it is time you take\nthis, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0008)]
20	Your [VAR FF00(0001)]Z-Power Ring[VAR FF00(0000)], a mysterious armband that\ncan draw out the power that lies deep\r\nwithin Pokémon...\c\nIt can bring forth their [VAR FF00(0001)]Z-Power[VAR FF00(0000)]![VAR 0114(0008)]
21	You slipped the Z-Power Ring onto your wrist!
22	We kahunas can make Z-Power Rings using\nstones like the Sparkling Stone that you\r\nreceived from Tapu Koko.[VAR 0114(0008)]
23	Though you will need to undergo the island\nchallenge and collect Z-Crystals for yourself,\r\nif you wish to draw forth Pokémon’s Z-Power![VAR 0114(0008)]
24	And yet you have already received that\nSparkling Stone...\c\nIt seems Tapu Koko took quite a liking to you...\nor perhaps it has a mission for you.[VAR 0114(0008)]
25	Well, it’s time for you to get out there and start\nyour [VAR FF00(0001)]island challenge[VAR FF00(0000)]!\c\nIf you visit every island, maybe you’ll figure out\nwhat that mission is.[VAR 0114(0005)]
26	The island challenge?
27	Every island?
28	Four islands![VAR 0114(0005)]
29	You’ll travel to each of the four islands here\nin the Alola region.\c\nThe island challenge is about aiming to be the\nstrongest Trainer—\r\nthe [VAR FF00(0001)]island challenge champion[VAR FF00(0000)]. Woo![VAR 0114(0005)]
30	Sounds great, right?\nI can’t wait to have a real adventure![VAR 0114(0007)]
31	But I’ll let Kahuna Hala explain the details![VAR 0114(0005)]
65
0	The island challenge Kukui spoke of...\c\nIt is a journey to overcome your own limitations,\nas you travel the far corners of Alola and meet\r\nwith others along the path.[VAR 0114(0008)]
1	It is the great adventure that children in the\nAlola region embark upon, along with their\r\nPokémon, once they reach 11 years of age![VAR 0114(0008)]
2	Allow me to give you both the island challenge\namulets you will need.[VAR 0114(0008)]
3	Awesome!\nThanks, Tutu![VAR 0114(0007)]
4	I’m gonna make it through the island challenge\nto try to become an island challenge champion![VAR 0114(0007)]
5	There is one for you as well, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nPlease do give the island challenge a try.[VAR 0114(0008)]
6	Yeah, doing the island challenge is the best way\nto really get to know Alola![VAR 0114(0005)]
66
0	That was a most mysterious event...\c\nA festival to celebrate drawing forth one’s\nfull power...[VAR 0114(0030)]
1	You looked like you were enjoying the show.\nDid you want to take part in the battles, too?[VAR 0114(0030)]
2	Don’t be silly...\nWe are here to investigate and learn.[VAR 0114(0030)]
3	Even with all of our technology, we cannot\ncontrol the Blinding One’s light...\c\nThus we are left with no choice but to try to\nstop it by force!\c\nAnd yet it seems that the humans of this Alola\ncan wield powerful auras.[VAR 0114(0030)]
4	Yeah, what’d they call that thing?\nA Z-Power Ring?\r\nIts aura readings were off the chart!\c\nDo you think that’s why they can control auras\nlike that?\c\nAlola is definitely an amazing place!\nLet’s go check the next site![VAR 0114(0030)]
5	Captain...\c\nI was able to detect high levels of aura at this\nfull-powered festival.[VAR 0114(0030)]
6	I suppose you would...\c\nAccording to our earlier research it seems that\nthe Z-Power Ring and this Tapu Koko creature\r\nare bathed in a great deal of light.[VAR 0114(0030)]
7	Alola overflows with the light that was released\nby the Blinding One...\r\nI find myself rather envious.[VAR 0114(0030)]
8	I wonder if we can’t find some way to use the\ngreat power that fills Alola for ourselves...[VAR 0114(0030)]
9	That is precisely what we, the Ultra Recon\nSquad, are here to make clear.\c\nOnward! There is still so much of Alola we have\nnot seen, and we must investigate it all![VAR 0114(0030)]
10	Tapu Koko is amazing, isn’t it?\c\nI hope I can meet it again someday and thank it\nfor saving Nebby...[VAR 0114(0006)]
11	Pew!
12	Me, too
13	Oh yeah?
14	It saved you as well, didn’t it?\nAnd left you with that Sparkling Stone...\r\neven though you’re a stranger to this place.[VAR 0114(0006)]
15	You know, [VAR 0100(0000)]...\nit did save your life, too.\c\nAnd it even gifted you that Sparkling Stone...\neven though you’re a stranger to this place.[VAR 0114(0006)]
16	Suppose it’s time we get you kids home, yeah?[VAR 0114(0005)]
17	Nebby...\nAlola is full of all kinds of wonders, isn’t it?[VAR 0114(0006)]

1	Mrawr!
2	Oh, [VAR 0100(0000)]! You’re back already?\nI thought you’d want to stay in Iki Town longer...[VAR 0114(0004)]
3	Especially right after that great Pokémon battle!\nOoh, I was just captivated to see my own [VAR 1100(00FF,0403)]boygirl\r\nfighting in such perfect sync with h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]iser partner![VAR 0114(0004)]
4	Maybe it would be a good idea for you to try\nthat island challenge thing...\c\nIt’s something you can only do in Alola, right?[VAR 0114(0004)]
5	But right now I’ve got a date with my bed.\nI danced my feet off at that festival!\r\nNight-night, sweetie. You get some sleep, too![VAR 0114(0004)]

4	If it’s Kukui, he’ll probably let himself in without\neven waiting for us to open the door![VAR 0114(0004)]
5	Mrowr.

0	Oh. Um...[VAR 0114(0006)]
1	The professor said...[VAR 0114(0006)]
2	“Hey there, Lillie!\nBring me that great new Trainer. Woo!”[VAR 0114(0006)]
3	So I’m here to show you the way to his Pokémon\nlab, if you’ll come with me.[VAR 0114(0006)]
4	It’s, um... It’s this way.[VAR 0114(0006)]
5	[VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0004)]
6	Here. A little pocket money for you.\nDon’t go wasting it on anything too silly![VAR 0114(0004)]
7	Oh! Well done, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nYou’re already making friends, aren’t you?\r\nAnd what a cute little friend you’ve found!\c\nI knew Alola would be a great place for us.\nWe just keep meeting wonderful people here![VAR 0114(0004)]
8	M-me? Well, thank you...\c\nMy name is Lillie.\nIt’s very nice to meet you.[VAR 0114(0006)]
9	Looks like it’s finally your time to shine, sweetie!\c\nEnjoy yourself out there with [VAR 0101(0001)].\nAnd don’t be gone too long![VAR 0114(0004)]
10	You...have a very nice mother, don’t you?[VAR 0114(0006)]
11	We should get going.\nI’ll show you to the Pokémon Research Lab.[VAR 0114(0006)]
71
0	You can reach the professor’s lab by treading\nthrough the tall grass here.\c\nHe says he can research moves better when\nhe is so surrounded by Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0006)]
1	Since I’m not a Trainer, though, I have to rely on\nusing Repels all the time.\c\nYou do know that using Repel keeps Pokémon\nfrom attacking, right?[VAR 0114(0006)]
2	A-and about Nebby...\c\nOh. I mean...Cosmog.\c\nCosmog seems to be a very rare Pokémon.\nIt came from far, far away.[VAR 0114(0006)]
3	Pew!
4	It seems to have a very strange power...\c\nIt used that power to save me once when I was\nin danger.[VAR 0114(0006)]
5	But some...other people want Cosmog for\nthemselves, to use that power.\c\nThat’s why only the professor and Kahuna Hala\nand other people I can trust know about it...[VAR 0114(0006)]
6	Can you keep a secret?\c\nCan you not tell anyone else about Nebby\nor what happened on that bridge? Please...[VAR 0114(0006)]
7	Oh...[VAR 0100(0000)]?\nDo you want to know something neat?[VAR 0114(0006)]
8	You can reach the Pokémon Research Lab\nwithout having to go through any patches of\r\ntall grass if you jump down from this ledge.[VAR 0114(0006)]
9	Just like this.[VAR 0114(0006)]
10	Hyup![VAR 0114(0006)]
11	If you’d like to take a shortcut, I suggest you\ntry it, too.\c\nI’ll be heading to the lab now, so see you there![VAR 0114(0006)]
12	Not that way![VAR 0114(0006)]
72
0	Ahh...\nThere they go again...[VAR 0114(0006)]
1	The Pokémon Research Lab has its own unique\ncharm, as I think you might agree.\c\nI’ve actually been, um, imposing on the\nprofessor here for the past three months.\c\nI’m not much of an assistant, but it’s the least\nI can do to pay him back for letting me stay.[VAR 0114(0006)]
2	Maybe I’d be more help if I were a real Pokémon\nTrainer, too...[VAR 0114(0006)]
3	Raaaa-oooooohhh! Raff ruff!
4	Oh yeah, Rockruff! Let’s go!\nGive it everything you’ve got!\r\nMy body is ready. Woo![VAR 0114(0005)]
5	The professor...\c\nHe never stops researching moves.\nNot even...inside the lab itself.[VAR 0114(0006)]
6	Looks like we’ll have to patch the roof again...[VAR 0114(0006)]
7	And I had just washed his lab coat and finally\ngotten it clean, too. Now it’ll be in shreds...\r\nand I’m no good at mending clothes...\r\nso he’ll just have to buy another new one...[VAR 0114(0006)]
8	We should probably go in before he does\nany more damage...[VAR 0114(0006)]
9	Please don’t wander off![VAR 0114(0006)]
10	[~ 10]
11	[~ 11]
73
0	Hey there, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nThanks for getting h[VAR 1100(0000,0202)]imer for me, Lillie![VAR 0114(0005)]
1	Of course. However I can be a help...\nI am supposed to be your assistant, right?[VAR 0114(0006)]
2	Rockruff’s moves were just so stylin’, and I was\nmaking good progress with my research.\c\nSay, [VAR 0100(0000)], lemme see your Pokédex\nfor a second, yeah?[VAR 0114(0005)]
3	So what do you think of the place?\nNot bad, right?[VAR 0114(0005)]
4	But that’s not why I called you here, eh?\nHere! It finally arrived![VAR 0114(0005)]
5	“It”...?[VAR 0114(0006)]
6	What’s wrong, Lillie? Don’t make me do all\nthe talking![VAR 0114(0005)]
7	See, there’s this Pokémon inside your Pokédex\ncalled Rotom...[VAR 0114(0005)]
8	Really?
9	Rotom?
10	Oh, I can tell you about Rotom.\c\nIt is a peculiar Pokémon, with a body made up\nof something like electricity.\r\nIt can take up residence in machines.[VAR 0114(0006)]
11	Yeah, buddy! And to put that crazy skill of\nRotom’s to work...
12	It’s the next generation of Pokédexes, but it’s\nonly complete once Rotom has gone into this\r\nbody specially developed for it!
13	A whole new way for people and Pokémon\nto communicate. Woo!\c\nAnd there’s only a few of these beauties out in\nthe world so far!
14	And now if I power up your Pokédex with the\nparts that I just got in...[VAR 0114(0005)]
15	...Kzzzt?
16	Hey now! Sorry ’bout that, Rotom.\nGuess I surprised you?[VAR 0114(0005)]
17	Zz-zzt...
18	Rotom!\c\nHere, boy! I powered up your favorite ’Dex!\c\nGive [VAR 0100(0000)] here a Helping\nHand, yeah?[VAR 0114(0005)]
19	Kzzzt...
20	Check it out, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nNow Rotom can talk right to you!\c\nIt may take it a little while to get used to its\nnew job, but I’d say Rotom’s taken a liking\r\nto you![VAR 0114(0005)]
21	[~ 21]
22	And this will help how exactly?[VAR 0114(0006)]
23	[VAR 0100(0000)] hasn’t been here in Alola too\nlong yet.\c\nSo I decided to give h[VAR 1100(0000,0202)]imer this special Rotom Dex\nto help h[VAR 1100(0000,0202)]imer navigate around.[VAR 0114(0005)]
24	Thank you very much
25	Nice to meet you, Rotom!
26	You can see where you’re headed just by\nlooking at Rotom, and if you give it a little tap,\r\nyou can even check out the [VAR FF00(0001)]Town Map[VAR FF00(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
27	A-lo-la![VAR 0114(0007)]
28	The salty breeze sang to me and brought me\nhere to you![VAR 0114(0007)]
29	Whoa-ho-ho![VAR 0114(0007)]
30	Is that a loft?! That’s awesome![VAR 0114(0007)]
31	No, it’s not! It’s private!\c\nThe professor has been kind enough to let me\nuse it...[VAR 0114(0006)]
32	If you see a person or a Pokémon\nwho needs help, you just help them...\r\nRight, [VAR 0100(0000)]? Hau?[VAR 0114(0005)]
33	And that’s why I’m letting Lillie stay up there\nin the loft.[VAR 0114(0005)]

22	OK!
23	What?
24	To the Trainers’ School![VAR 0114(0005)]
25	You’ve gotta learn the basics of being a\nPokémon Trainer through Pokémon battling.\c\nIt’s a long road to becoming the island challenge\nchampion, and the Trainers’ School is the\r\nfirst step![VAR 0114(0005)]
26	What about you, Hau?[VAR 0114(0005)]
27	I’m good. I just wanna play with my Pokémon![VAR 0114(0007)]
28	The island challenge...\c\nSo this is how the people of Alola connect with\nthe world around them.[VAR 0114(0006)]
29	And then there’s the way that you and\n[VAR 0101(0001)] both chose one another.\r\nAnd now with Rotom helping you out as well...\c\nEven Nebby likes you! I guess there’s something\nabout you that makes Pokémon feel comfortable\r\nwhen they’re by your side.[VAR 0114(0006)]
30	Lillie!\nYou take care of [VAR 0100(0000)], yeah?\c\nUntil [VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]she gets used to Rotom, help h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer find h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]iser\nway around![VAR 0114(0005)]
31	[~ 31]

2	Everything has fallen into darkness...
3	Pew...
4	Nebby...\nDon’t worry—it’s OK.[VAR 0114(0006)]
5	This must be what they call a solar eclipse.\nIt happens when the sun gets covered up.[VAR 0114(0006)]
6	This must be what they call a lunar eclipse.\nIt happens when the moon gets covered up.[VAR 0114(0006)]
7	Was a solar eclipse forecast for today?\c\nAh, well. It must be some kind of good\nomen, yeah![VAR 0114(0005)]
8	Was a lunar eclipse forecast for today?\c\nAh, well. It must be some kind of good\nomen, yeah![VAR 0114(0005)]
9	An omen?\nYou think something good will happen?[VAR 0114(0006)]
10	Sure! A long, long time ago, Alola was cloaked in\ndarkness, yeah...\c\nBut people say that’s when Alola’s people and\nPokémon blasted all that darkness away\r\nwith light!\c\nAnd they also say that was why people started\ngathering Z-Crystals, and that custom turned\r\ninto the island challenge.[VAR 0114(0005)]
11	[VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nNow that you’ve got that Z-Power Ring, I hope\nyou’ll collect tons of Z-Crystals! Woo!\c\nThat’s exactly what a move researcher like me\nneeds to uncover new secrets![VAR 0114(0005)]
12	Professor, that’s not why [VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]she’s supposed to be\ndoing it...\c\nCome on, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nI’ll show you to the Pokémon Center.[VAR 0114(0006)]
13	Visiting every last part of Alola, yeah...\nThat will be your island challenge![VAR 0114(0005)]

1	It’s amazing, isn’t it?\c\nI can’t stand seeing Pokémon in pain...[VAR 0114(0006)]
2	You can also deposit Pokémon in the PC here\nor take them out.[VAR 0114(0006)]
3	And at the Poké Mart you can buy all kinds of\nitems that should help you during your trials.\c\nI’d take a look, if I were you.[VAR 0114(0006)]
4	Over there is the café area.[VAR 0114(0006)]
5	I like to relax there sometimes with a frosty\nglass of Moomoo Milk.[VAR 0114(0006)]
6	I read something in a travel guide about\nAlola once...\c\nApparently each Pokémon Center in Alola offers\na different selection of drinks.\r\nI wonder how they pick what to serve?[VAR 0114(0006)]
7	The cafés may also offer more than just drinks.\c\nI’ve heard they also sell special treats and that\nsometimes the staff have tips for trial-goers.[VAR 0114(0006)]
8	Pew!
9	We should head to the Trainers’ School next.\c\nBut have your Pokémon taken care of first if\nyou think that they need a little aid.[VAR 0114(0006)]

3	But we were only planning to go as far as\nthe Trainers’ School anyway.[VAR 0114(0006)]
4	We’ll just leave that for someone else to deal\nwith. Come. Follow me.[VAR 0114(0006)]
5	Moo-aaarrr!

0	Hey there, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nI must’ve passed you two somehow, yeah?[VAR 0114(0005)]
1	But welcome to the Trainers’ School, the place\nto learn how to be a Pokémon Trainer![VAR 0114(0005)]
2	[~ 2]
3	[~ 3]
4	Professor Kukui!\nIs this the child you told me about?
5	Yeah. [VAR 0100(0000)]’s a real tough one, too.\nPut h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer through the wringer good, Teach![VAR 0114(0005)]
6	Four Trainers![VAR 0114(0005)]
7	You’ve got to beat four Pokémon Trainers here\nat the school, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nThe experience will surely help you and your\nPokémon grow stronger, yeah.\c\nActually... Speaking of experience, why don’t\nyou take this.[VAR 0114(0005)]
8	If you keep that Exp. Share on, yeah,\nall the Pokémon on your team can get\r\nExp. Points from battle.[VAR 0114(0005)]
9	The Trainers who will take part in this lesson\nmay be inside or outside the school.
10	You may also want to visit our classrooms.\c\nYou’ll learn things there that will help on your\njourney, I’d say.
11	[~ 11]
12	[~ 12]
13	All right. Let the lesson begin!
14	She may not look all that tough, but that teach\ntrains her kids right!\r\nOne of her students is even a captain![VAR 0114(0005)]
15	If you want a bit of advice from me, here’s\nsomething that might help.\c\nOnce you’ve fought a species of Pokémon once,\nyou can easily see what types of moves will\r\nwork best on it in your next battle.[VAR 0114(0005)]
16	Wandering about in the tall grass to meet\nlots of different Pokémon’ll help with that!\r\nBattle all the time, oh yeah![VAR 0114(0005)]
17	Seeing a Pokémon in pain makes my own heart\nseem to ache.\c\nYou can come talk to me anytime that you want\nyour team’s health restored. I’m happy to help.[VAR 0114(0006)]
18	Let me take care of poor [VAR 0101(0001)], OK?[VAR 0114(0006)]
19	Please try not to push your Pokémon too hard...\nUm...I mean...if you don’t mind...[VAR 0114(0006)]

5	Metapod looks so cute munching down an Oran\nBerry in the middle of battle!
6	[~ 6]
7	You can tell me anytime that you want your\nteam’s health restored, and I’ll help you.\c\nSeeing a Pokémon in pain makes my own heart\nseem to ache...[VAR 0114(0006)]

9	Please try not to push your Pokémon too hard...\nUm...I mean...if you don’t mind...[VAR 0114(0006)]
10	I’ll show you my Grimer’s best move!\nWith Poison Gas, it’ll poison everyone that\r\ncomes at us!
11	Grass-type Pokémon are immune to powder\nmoves, like Poison Powder and Sleep Powder.\c\nBut you can still poison ’em with Poison Gas!
12	If my precious Bonsly takes damage in a\nPokémon battle, I’ll want to use a Potion on it!
13	You can help your Pokémon win by using items\nat the right time.\c\nThey can do more than just healing your\nPokémon’s HP, too. You can even boost their\r\nstats and things like that.
14	You wanna know why I’m standing here?\nBecause I’m the strongest, that’s why!\c\nI won’t even bother battling you unless you can\nbeat everyone else here!
15	Looks like you beat everybody else, huh?\c\nBut don’t think you’ll beat me the same way!\nEkans’s Ability is gonna get you!
16	Intimidate is an Ability that lowers your\nopponent’s Attack stat.\c\nIf you understand your Pokémon’s Abilities,\nyou can use the best strategies in battle.
17	But fine! Whatever!\c\nI can admit it when I’m beat.\nI’ll give you a reward even.\r\nTake this Technical Machine!
18	OK. First thing to know about TMs.\c\nTechnical Machines teach new techniques.\nThey’ll give your Pokémon a new move in a flash.\c\nBut if your Pokémon can’t learn the move in a\nTM, then too bad. You are up the creek, pal.\c\nSecond thing to know about TMs.\c\nYou can use a TM as many times as you want,\non as many different Pokémon as you want.\c\nThey don’t wear out or get used up.\nPretty nice gift from me, huh?
19	Oh, that’s the school bell.[VAR 0114(0006)]
20	Attention, all students...\c\nWould [VAR 0100(0000)] please come to the\noffice on 2F?\c\n[VAR 0100(0000)] to the 2F office, please.
21	What terrible thing did you do to get called to\nthe office so soon?[VAR 0114(0006)]
22	Nothing!
23	Well...
24	That’s what you say...[VAR 0114(0006)]
25	So you did do something?![VAR 0114(0006)]

1	beat all of my students! Fantastic!
2	After seeing such a performance, I think I’d like\nto battle you myself!\c\nWhat do you say?\nAre you ready to take me on?
3	Good. I heard about you from Professor Kukui.\c\nI’ll be challenging you with a Pokémon that has\na type advantage against that [VAR 0101(0000)]\r\nyou chose for your partner!
4	You must be joking!\c\nYou do know how much experience you could\ngain from battling me, right?
5	Nice! Maybe you’d like to take over as teacher\nhere for me!
6	All joking aside, though, I do want you to take\nthese from me...\c\nIt’s a little reward for beating me.
7	They’re Great Balls. Great Balls are better at\ncatching Pokémon than normal Poké Balls.
8	Know your Pokémon and know their moves.\nThose are the basics of being a Trainer![VAR 0114(0005)]
9	How about it?[VAR 0114(0005)]

2	This is [VAR 0100(0000)], who moved here to\nAlola from the Kanto region.\c\n[VAR 1100(00FF,0201)]HShe’s got a real sense for how to use moves,\nand I think [VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]she’s gonna go far as a Trainer, yeah![VAR 0114(0005)]
3	I see!\nThen welcome, newcomer.\c\nI look forward to seeing the brilliance of your\nmoves in my [VAR FF00(0001)]trial[VAR FF00(0000)].[VAR 0114(000C)]
4	Indeed! We captains are the ones who conduct\nthe trials you will face on your way to\r\nchallenging the island kahuna.[VAR 0114(000C)]
5	My trial is held in Verdant Cavern.\nThe trial of Captain Ilima.[VAR 0114(000C)]
6	You can find Pokémon living everywhere, even\nin the patches of tall grass in Hau’oli City.\c\nPerhaps you’ll want to fill out your team a bit\nbefore attempting my trial?[VAR 0114(000C)]
7	I sincerely look forward to your challenge.[VAR 0114(000C)]
8	Oh yeah!
9	I reported to the folks upstairs about that\nTauros blocking the road out front again.
10	That guy’s Tauros is pretty much a celebrity\nhere on Melemele, you know?[VAR 0114(0005)]
11	Well, I guess it’s time that we dismiss you from\nschool, [VAR 0100(0000)].

1	You know...\c\nI was really impressed seeing how you battled\nwith your Pokémon at the Trainers’ School...[VAR 0114(0006)]
2	It feels like you’re really giving it your all for\nyour Pokémon’s sake...\c\nI think that’s why you were able to save Nebby\nthat time, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0006)]

2	Oh, but I’ve got an idea...\nWhy not give him a little pat, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0008)]
3	Where will you try petting Tauros?[VAR 0114(0008)]
4	Pet its face
5	Stroke its mane
6	Grab it by the tail
7	Hrmmm. That doesn’t seem to have impressed\nTauros very much.[VAR 0114(0008)]
8	Bwoh!
9	Ha ha ha! You see that? This rascal already\nloves you!\c\nPokémon become happier when we show them\nsome [VAR FF00(0001)]care[VAR FF00(0000)].[VAR 0114(0008)]
10	Wa ha ha! Oh the places you’ll go, child!\c\nAnd as you do, you will surely meet more\nPokémon and people who will enrich your life.[VAR 0114(0008)]
11	The kahunas sure are something, eh?\nAble to calm a raging Pokémon without even\r\nneeding to battle... Now that’s something!\c\nI mean, I like Tauros plenty and all...\c\nbut it is pretty scary! I don’t want to ride on it![VAR 0114(0007)]
12	So where are you two off to now?[VAR 0114(0007)]
13	I was thinking I should show [VAR 0100(0000)]\naround Hau’oli City a bit.[VAR 0114(0006)]
14	Nice idea!\nYou’re always on top of things, Lillie!\c\n[VAR 0100(0000)] just got here to Alola, huh?\c\nThen let me tag along, too!\nI wanna go get something good to eat![VAR 0114(0007)]
15	All right. Let’s all go together.[VAR 0114(0006)]
16	Then what’re we waiting for!\nThis way! Come on![VAR 0114(0007)]
17	Oh, Hau...\c\nI guess we should go catch up with him before\nhe gets too far, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nHau’oli City is the biggest city in all Alola.[VAR 0114(0006)]
18	Oh, Tauros...\c\nWell, at least it’s nice that the Pokémon in Alola\nare so lively and such a part of everyday life.[VAR 0114(0006)]
19	Don’t worry, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nThat Tauros likes being petted by people.[VAR 0114(0007)]

0	Hey, miss. Is it true that you can get some kinda\nspecial gift if you have a Rotom Dex?[VAR 0114(0007)]
1	My goodness, you get the news fast!\c\nHardly anyone has a Rotom Dex, but it is true\nthat we have a special item to go with it.\c\nIt’s our very own [VAR FF00(0001)]Poké Finder[VAR FF00(0000)]! Here you go!
2	Awesome![VAR 0114(0007)]
3	Isn’t that awesome, [VAR 0100(0000)]?\nYou got a Poké Finder![VAR 0114(0007)]
4	So, like, what’s a Poké Finder?[VAR 0114(0007)]
5	The Poké Finder is a tool that lets you take\nphotos of Pokémon.\c\nRotom will help point out places where you’ll\nbe able to take photos, too.\c\nHere, I’ll read you the instruction manual.\c\n“Tap on Rotom or press .”\nYup, that’s all it says. Quite simple, isn’t it?
6	Man, that Rotom Dex is cool!\c\nIt’s like a whole nother partner, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nI mean, on top of your Pokémon partner![VAR 0114(0007)]
7	Oh, but I guess since it’s Rotom inside...\nit pretty much is a Pokémon partner?\c\nEither way, you’re pretty darn lucky.\nMeet you outside when you’re done in here![VAR 0114(0007)]

4	Oh, your mother must have a great sense of\nstyle then. I love the way that you dress.[VAR 0114(0006)]
5	I...I’ve always just worn the clothes that my\nmother wanted me to wear.\c\nI don’t really know what kind of thing would\nsuit me...[VAR 0114(0006)]
6	Oh! But that’s not why I stopped you.\nI meant to give you th[VAR 1100(00FF,0302)]isese, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nI received [VAR 1100(00FF,0402)]itthem inside the apparel shop here.[VAR 0114(0006)]
7	I didn’t even buy anything, but they said I was\nthe 99,999th customer to visit the store...\c\nBut I already have the same [VAR 1100(00FF,0303)]oneset, so I thought\nthat maybe you might...want [VAR 1100(00FF,0402)]itthem?[VAR 0114(0006)]
8	It looks like we have something in common now,\ndon’t we, [VAR 0100(0000)]? Hee...[VAR 0114(0006)]
91
0	Yo, Trainer. Look what you’ve got!
1	You lucky kid. If you’ve got a Poké Finder, then\nI guess I’ll give you a little tip.
2	See that spot where the wall is cracked?\nThat’s a photo spot right there.
3	Look at that! Your Rotom there is trying to tell\nyou, too! Give him a tap!
4	You can’t just let a chance like this go by!\nCome on, fire up that Poké Finder!
5	I hear it’s best to try to photograph Pokémon\nhead on and zoomed in as close as possible!
6	If you want to know more about the Poké Finder,\nwell, just keep on taking tons of pictures!
92
0	[VAR 0100(0000)], Hau...\nDid you visit the tourist bureau? How was it?[VAR 0114(0006)]

2	What a bunch of useless thugs!\c\nAll they do is drag Trainers into battles they\ndon’t want and try to steal people’s Pokémon!
3	I heard they keep trying to sneak into the\ntrial site to steal Pokémon to sell...\r\nand that they fail every single time!

4	What, what?! Why you trying to act hard when\nwe’re already hard as bone out here, homie?[VAR 0114(0031)]
5	Yo, let’s check these fools.[VAR 0114(0032)]
6	Oh my... How terrifying...[VAR 0114(000C)]

3	Pew!
4	I read something in an old book once. It said \nthat the island challenges were once a journey\r\nmade to prove yourself and gain the strength to\r\nbattle against the guardian deities of Alola.\c\nLike Tapu Koko...\c\nThe people in Iki Town said that Tapu Koko\nloves Pokémon battles, didn’t they?[VAR 0114(0006)]
5	If we could meet Tapu Koko once more, do you\nthink we would find the answer to why it saved\r\nyou and Nebby that day, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0006)]
6	Pew?
7	Oh yes... Please take these.\nThey are called Revives.\c\nIf you use one on a Pokémon that has fainted,\nit will recover and feel a little better.[VAR 0114(0006)]

2	Who could resist giving their Pokémon a few\nmalasadas, eh? They’re just so cute![VAR 0114(0007)]
3	Yo, yo, yo, check it!\c\nWhenever, wherever we meet you,\nTeam Skull don’t even greet you![VAR 0114(0030)]
4	Yo, you wanna throw us a bone and hand over\nthose island challenge amulets to us now?[VAR 0114(0033)]
5	Ohhh. So you’re part of that Team Skull, huh?\c\nAll you guys ever do is steal Totem Stickers\nand people’s Pokémon and get in the way\r\nof other people’s island challenges![VAR 0114(0007)]
6	You know it!\c\nWe hate the island challenge, yo!\nAnd every kid fool enough to try it![VAR 0114(0031)]
7	Yo, let’s check these fools.[VAR 0114(0032)]
8	[VAR 0100(0000)]! Come on!\c\nLet’s teach these Team Skull jerks not to get\nin the way of anybody’s island challenge![VAR 0114(0007)]
9	Where you think you’re stepping off to, li’l\n[VAR 1100(00FF,0603)]mansister? You ain’t even fought me yet![VAR 0114(0032)]
10	Yo, check how I change the game with my mad\nPokémon skills![VAR 0114(0032)]
11	No fair! I was playing a different game![VAR 0114(0032)]
12	Stupid kahuna’s grandson or whatever! We’re\nnot a fan of you![VAR 0114(0031)]
13	Let’s get up out this port, B! Nobody has to\nknow about this!\c\nWe don’t need your wack little amulets anyway!\nWouldn’t even take ’em if you gave ’em to us![VAR 0114(0031)]
14	Those Team Skull jerks really must have too\nmuch time on their hands, yeah?\c\nBut keeping other people from doing their\nisland challenges isn’t gonna just make it like\r\nthey managed to finish theirs, you know?[VAR 0114(0007)]
15	I already went down to the Marina and\nscreamed out over the ocean, “Watch out, world!\r\nSomeday I’m gonna beat even my old\r\ngramps in an all-out serious battle!”\c\nSo maybe I’ll go try to find some more Totem\nStickers next. See you around![VAR 0114(0007)]

0	Moo-aaarrr!
1	[VAR 0100(0000)]!\nYou stand back.\c\nOld kahuna Hala will take care of this\nornery Tauros!\r\nWhy don’t you take a stroll through Hau’oli?[VAR 0114(0008)]
2	Hah![VAR 0114(0008)]
3	There! [VAR 0100(0000)], I’ve got this ornery\ncreature calmed again, for now.\c\nWant to try giving him a little pat again?\nThat’s the only way he’ll get used to you.[VAR 0114(0008)]
4	Come on, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nTry showing Tauros a bit of affection![VAR 0114(0008)]
5	Poke it on the nose
6	Touch its forelegs
7	Grab it by the horns
8	Hrmmm. Tauros didn’t seem to care for that.[VAR 0114(0008)]
9	Moo-oo-oo. ♪
10	Maybe old Tauros here can feel your love for\nPokémon. He sure seems happy to know you.\c\nAnd yet...\c\nIt still seems to me like Tauros wants to stretch\nhis legs on his own island challenge! Ha![VAR 0114(0008)]
11	What! You want to play tag, now?\nThe Melemele kahuna never loses, friend![VAR 0114(0008)]

1	Crabrawler doesn’t seem to want to let you\npast it...\c\nIt seems to be forcing you toward the motel,\nin fact.
2	Crabrawler doesn’t seem to want to let you\npast it...\c\nIt seems to want you to go see what lies past\nthe motel, in fact.
100
0	We’re right by the sea! That’s right!\nWelcome to my wonderful seaside motel!
1	My Crabrawler sure is something, ain’t he?\c\nHe nabs passersby to bring them to me,\nso I can send them down by the bay!
2	[~ 2]
3	Though he’s actually been a little too good at\nhis job, so I’ve got no vacant rooms to offer you.\c\nBut that doesn’t mean you’ve come for nothing!
4	Here, follow me this way.
5	See that! Look at that broad expanse of beach!\nIts name is Big Wave Beach.\c\nThere are some interesting Pokémon to be found\ndown on the beach, so I’d suggest having a look.
6	And, just so you know, the path to the beach\nwas made by none other than yours truly.\r\nThat’s right, just me and my Crabrawler!
7	[~ 7]
101
0	Hey, little cousin! Welcome to Big Wave Beach!\c\nYou’ve come to exactly the right place if you’re\nlooking for some Mantine Surf!
1	Mantine Surf is just what it says on the box.\nYou climb up on the back of our Mantine...\r\nand then you surf!\c\nSurfing is the best sport, where you can enjoy\ntraveling across the ocean waves!
2	Though youngsters like yourself who want to\nget into Mantine Surf have to toughen up\r\nand show that they can really handle it first.\c\nSurfing is a bit of a dangerous sport, to be fair.
3	Come back when you’re as tough as a real\nkahuna, OK?\c\nMe and Mantine will be holding our breath in\nanticipation till you do!\c\nWait, do Mantine breathe?\nCan they even hold their breath?
102
0	You’d better be ready for the mischief masters\nof Team Skull to do some Mantine Surfing, too![VAR 0114(0031)]
1	Oh. Team Skull.\nYou know you guys can’t ride here.
2	What’s up with that?! We look like kids to you\nor somethin’?![VAR 0114(0032)]
3	No. The real reason is...
4	Yeah, the real reason is?[VAR 0114(0031)]
5	Every time you try, you keep up those ridiculous\ndance moves even on Mantine’s back.\r\nAnd then you end up in the water.
6	You want us to stop dancing?! That’s our\nidentity, yo! It’s all we’ve got![VAR 0114(0032)]
7	Man, forget her, B![VAR 0114(0031)]
8	We’re Team Skull! No one can stop us from\nacting hardheaded![VAR 0114(0032)]
9	Somebody! Please help keep these numskulls\naway from Mantine!
10	What’re you looking at, short stuff?\nHuh? Huh... Wait, huh?!\c\nYou’re that kid![VAR 0114(0031)]
11	You wanna scrap, tiny Trainer? A battle, yo?\c\nYou might’ve beat us in Hau’oli City, but we’ll\nput our heads together to beat you this time![VAR 0114(0032)]
12	Seriously, home slice?!\nYou’re too strong for a kid, yo!\c\nArgh! I’ve gotta go make someone else miserable\nto feel better!\c\nLet’s go mess with Ilima again, B![VAR 0114(0032)]
13	I’m down with that.\nVerdant Cavern’s pretty close by anyway.\c\nHey, you!\c\nYou better listen to what my homie says\nand drill it into that thick skull of yours!\r\nSeriously! You’d better not forget, numskull![VAR 0114(0031)]
14	Nice one, kid! Mantine won’t be subjected to\ntheir terrible surfing skills thanks to you!\c\nYou’re a decent Trainer. Just like I’d expect\nfrom a trial-goer on the island challenge!\r\nWhy don’t you take this from me?
15	I bet you could take on Captain Ilima’s trial\nwith how well you handled that battle.\r\nEven Kahuna Hala would probably say you’re\r\nready to take on all of Alola!\c\nIf he says that you’re ready, come back here\nand we’ll get you up on Mantine in no time!
16	Meet lots of different Pokémon on your journey!\c\nThat’s how I became friends with Mantine here,\nback in the days of my own island challenge.
103
0	Yes, I see...\nSo this way lies Verdant Cavern...\c\nIt is one of the places in this land filled with\nthe Blinding One’s power...\r\nMost certainly worth our investigating![VAR 0114(0030)]
1	Yup! The aura levels are really high![VAR 0114(0030)]
2	Calm yourself, Zossie.\c\nIt will be difficult for us to investigate it, though,\nsince we do not use Pokémon of our own...\r\nWe will have to think of some other way.\c\nPerhaps we could use our technology to find\na way to control Pokémon...[VAR 0114(0030)]
3	Maybe I could go in as a trial-goer?\nTake on the trial and everything?\c\nThough I don’t have one of those island\nchallenge amulet thingies...[VAR 0114(0030)]
4	Verdant Cavern...\nIt’s showing very high numbers.[VAR 0114(0030)]
5	It would.\c\nIn the heart of this cave lies an item that has\nan undeniable connection to the Blinding One.\c\nI certainly would like to investigate this place.[VAR 0114(0030)]
6	Shall we go in then?[VAR 0114(0030)]
7	No... It seems that people are not allowed within\nthis Verdant Cavern without specific reason.\c\nWe should ask the president to arrange for\nsome special accommodations on our behalf.\c\nWe don’t yet have the means to capture\nPokémon on our own, after all.[VAR 0114(0030)]
8	Perhaps we will have to think of some new\nmethods, such as asking some trial-goer to\r\ncooperate with our investigations...[VAR 0114(0030)]
104
0	Wow!\nA Z-Crystal![VAR 0114(0030)]
1	So that is what they call a Z-Crystal!\c\nIt appears that Alola’s mysterious Z-Crystals\nare received for overcoming trials, is that right?[VAR 0114(0030)]
2	I suppose it may be admirable to overcome such\ntrials using your own strength and skill...\r\nrather than relying on technology, as we do.[VAR 0114(0030)]
3	I’m Zossie!\nYou’re kind of awesome, you know?[VAR 0114(0037)]
4	Ah. This is when you are supposed to say\n“Alola” to one another, is it not?\c\nI am Dulse.[VAR 0114(0036)]
5	And we’re part of the Ultra Recon Squad, yup!\c\nThat ball thing you used there...\nThat is some amazing bit of tech!\r\nWe might just have to borrow that idea![VAR 0114(0037)]
6	We’re investigating all about Z-Crystals and\nauras and all kinds of stuff.\r\nSo I guess we’ll probably see you around![VAR 0114(0037)]
7	Ho! So [VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]she claimed the light of the Z-Crystal as\nh[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]iser own, with the aid of h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]iser Pokémon...[VAR 0114(0030)]
8	The people of Alola overcome these trials\nwillingly to obtain this mysterious power...\r\nto gain access to Z-Power. Is that it?[VAR 0114(0030)]
9	Depending on no one and nothing but yourself...\nThat is a fine aspiration.\c\nQuite different from our tendency to use our\ntechnology to solve all of our problems.[VAR 0114(0030)]
10	It is a pleasure to meet you.\nMy name is Soliera.[VAR 0114(0038)]
11	I am Phyco.\c\nAh, yes!\nI believe we are expected to greet you with an\r\n“Alola.” Is that right?[VAR 0114(0039)]
12	We are investigating the Z-Crystals found here\nin Alola for our own particular reasons.\c\nAnd I also find those Poké Balls that you use to\nbe most intriguing...[VAR 0114(0038)]
13	Perhaps we will find reason to work together\nsometime in the future.[VAR 0114(0038)]

1	Oran Berries can restore some of a Pokémon’s\nHP for them.\c\nYou can feed a Berry to a Pokémon, or let one\nhold a Berry and they’ll eat it when they need it.

2	Oh yeah! Almost forgot!\c\nI have something pretty amazing to share with\nyou, [VAR 0100(0000)]. You lucky thing![VAR 0114(0007)]
3	Revives are solid items to have!\nIf your Pokémon faints in battle and can’t go on,\r\nthen a Revive will perk ’em right back up!\c\nBut you probably won’t find Revives here.\nDidja know that Poké Marts sometimes sell\r\ndifferent things? And not just that!\c\nThe two clerks at the counter even sell\ndifferent things from one another![VAR 0114(0007)]
4	Oh yeah! But you’ve got that Rotom Dex, right?\nIf you tap it and play with it a lot, then you can\r\nuse [VAR FF00(0001)]Roto Loto[VAR FF00(0000)], too, right?[VAR 0114(0007)]
5	That’zzz right!\nGive me a tap when my eyezzz flash![VAR 0114(0035)]
6	Awesome! Do it, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Do it!\nTry Roto Loto for me![VAR 0114(0007)]

0	Greetings.\nCaptain Ilima here.[VAR 0114(000C)]
1	And my trial...[VAR 0114(000C)]
2	begins mere steps from here in Verdant Cavern![VAR 0114(000C)]
3	[~ 3]
4	Note that the Pokémon living within Verdant\nCavern are quite fierce.\c\nI wouldn’t venture in unless you’ve prepared\nsome Potions and so forth.[VAR 0114(000C)]
5	Through attempting the trials during the island\nchallenge, one can exceed his or her own limits.\r\n...That is what the Alolan people believe.[VAR 0114(000C)]
6	Once you enter Verdant Cavern, you will not be\nable to leave until you have completed the trial.\r\nAre you prepared for the trial?[VAR 0114(000C)]
7	I’ll be waiting for you![VAR 0114(000C)]
8	Please make your preparations. I’ll be waiting\nfor you![VAR 0114(000C)]
110
0	Let me formally welcome you to Verdant Cavern!\nI am your captain, Ilima.[VAR 0114(000C)]
1	Allow me to explain the basics of my trial.[VAR 0114(000C)]
2	What you should attempt to do is...[VAR 0114(000C)]
3	Defeat three of the Pokémon that lurk\nhere in their dens![VAR 0114(000C)]
4	Then reach the pedestal deep within the cave...\c\nand collect the [VAR FF00(0001)]Z-Crystal[VAR FF00(0000)] there![VAR 0114(000C)]
5	You’ll need to be completely in sync with your\nPokémon to succeed.[VAR 0114(000C)]
6	Grrrr!
7	Oh dear!\c\nAnd there’s one more thing I forgot to mention.[VAR 0114(000C)]
8	Many strong Pokémon make their home in this\ncave, but one stronger and more fearsome\r\nthan all the rest, known as a [VAR FF00(0001)]Totem Pokémon[VAR FF00(0000)],\r\nalso resides here!\c\nIt will be the greatest obstacle you face as you\nattempt to clear my trial![VAR 0114(000C)]
9	By the way, until you clear the trial, you will not \nbe able to catch Pokémon in Verdant Cavern.[VAR 0114(000C)]
10	This is but one of the eight trials you will face\nduring your island challenge. [VAR 0114(000C)]
11	And it begins now! The trial of Captain Ilima![VAR 0114(000C)]
12	Let the Verdant Cavern trial of Ilima...begin!
13	Not sure what to do?\nIt’s quite simple.\c\nDefeat the three Pokémon, reach the\npedestal at the back of the cave,\r\nand get the Z-Crystal.[VAR 0114(000C)]
14	Now all you need do is claim the Z-Crystal from\nthe pedestal![VAR 0114(000C)]
15	Ki-ki-ki-kiii!
16	The Totem [VAR 0101(0002)] is a formidable\nopponent for any Trainer to take on.\c\nIt is a Normal-type Pokémon, so perhaps you\nshould battle back with Fighting-type\r\nPokémon or moves![VAR 0114(000C)]
111
0	I’m a Trial Guide, here to help young boys and\ngirls attempting the island challenge.
1	Looks like there [VAR 1101(0000,0302)]isare [VAR 0200(0000)] more Pokémon for you\nand your team to prove yourself against.
2	Fantastic!\nYou proved your strength to all three Pokémon!\c\nThen go right ahead inside!
3	Going somewhere? The goal of the trial is\nto get the Z-Crystal, remember?
4	It’s pretty tough to even attempt the trial.\nAnd you managed to get a Z-Crystal and finish!\r\nYou’ll be a Trainer to keep an eye on!
5	Ooh, sorry, but I can’t let you through here till\nyou beat all three Pokémon you were asked to!
112
0	Yo, yo, yo![VAR 0114(0032)]
1	It’s your bad beach boys, back...back again!\nRemember us?[VAR 0114(0031)]
2	Sure, I do
3	Sorry, who are you?
4	Whoa! Even though we look identical?\nThat’s pretty impressive, actually![VAR 0114(0031)]
5	Oh, I see...[VAR 0114(0032)]
6	Just ’cause we switched places, you can’t tell\nwho we are anymore?![VAR 0114(0032)]
7	Who cares about that anyway?!\c\nWe’re here to mess h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]iser trial up, yo![VAR 0114(0031)]
8	Oh yeah, that’s right! Yo, let’s get that\nPokémon, homie![VAR 0114(0032)]
9	What’s up with that?[VAR 0114(0031)]
10	For real, though?! I can’t get my skull around it!\nThis kid’s mad strong, yo![VAR 0114(0032)]
11	Naw, it ain’t even like that. This kid is straight\nup dangerous, homie![VAR 0114(0031)]
12	I don’t know, man...\nIsn’t this whole place trouble?![VAR 0114(0032)]
13	Yeah! It totally is, homie!\c\nI mean, that thing is so strong that regular\nPokémon don’t even wanna come out and battle![VAR 0114(0031)]
14	Yo, kid! You know there’s a mad strong\nPokémon lurking back here somewhere, right?\r\nI’d run if I were you.[VAR 0114(0032)]
15	Naw, we’re not going out like that!\nWe gotta get our revenge!\c\nGo stand over that den and catch that skulking\n[VAR 0101(0001)], yo![VAR 0114(0031)]
16	For real?! Fine!\nI got no bones to pick with you![VAR 0114(0032)]
17	Yo, you think maybe all these dens are, like,\nconnected or something?\c\nIf they are, and we park our bones right here,\nthen nobody’ll come out these holes, right?[VAR 0114(0032)]
18	Yo, yo, yo! Come on out!\c\nI’m gonna make you man enough...or, uh,\n’mon enough to take on that big ol’ boss inside![VAR 0114(0031)]
19	Yo, yo, yo, homie!\nYou giving up already?![VAR 0114(0032)]
20	Yo, I’m over this! I’m out![VAR 0114(0031)]

114
0	Yes, [VAR 0100(0000)]?\c\nWould you like to give up so you can better\nprepare for my trial?\c\nKeep in mind you’ll have to start from the\nbeginning if you leave the cave now, though![VAR 0114(000C)]
1	I see.\c\nUnfortunately, I’ll have to ask you to go make\nwhatever preparations you may need to\r\nand then come back to try again.[VAR 0114(000C)]
2	Good!\c\nThen go and defeat the three Pokémon.\c\nOnly then will you be able to claim the Z-Crystal\nwaiting in the final chamber of the cave![VAR 0114(000C)]
3	Yes, [VAR 0100(0000)]? I take it you would like\nto attempt my trial again?[VAR 0114(000C)]
4	Very well, let the trial begin![VAR 0114(000C)]
5	I see.\c\nUnfortunately, I’ll have to ask you to go make\nwhatever preparations you may need to\r\nand then come back to try again.[VAR 0114(000C)]

0	You feel a piercing gaze that seems to cut right\nthrough you...but from where?
1	Will you take the Z-Crystal from the pedestal?
116
0	[VAR 0101(0000)], the Totem Pokémon of\nVerdant Cavern, has appeared!
1	Thhhh!
2	Thhhh!
3	[VAR 0101(0000)] disappeared back into the\ncave somewhere...
4	You reached out to grab the Z-Crystal from\nthe pedestal!
117
0	What an incredible Trainer you are![VAR 0114(000C)]
1	For you to be able to defeat the Totem Pokémon\nthat I had trained up to such a powerful state...\r\nI don’t know what I can say![VAR 0114(000C)]
2	Working in harmony with your Pokémon, you\nhave cleared the trial of Ilima!\r\nYou’re a phenomenal Trainer![VAR 0114(000C)]
3	Congratulations, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nThe Z-Crystal from the pedestal is yours now![VAR 0114(000C)]
118
0	You reached out to grab the Z-Crystal from\nthe pedestal!
1	You obtained a Normal-type Z-Crystal!\nThe Normalium Z is yours!
2	You placed the Normalium Z in your Bag’s\nZ-Crystals Pocket.
119
0	What you have just received is the Normal\nZ-Crystal![VAR 0114(000C)]
1	It is known as [VAR FF00(0001)]Normalium Z![VAR FF00(0000)][VAR 0114(000C)]
2	[~ 2]
3	Now if you let a Pokémon that can use a\nNormal-type move hold that...[VAR 0114(000C)]
4	and strike an elegant pose like this one...\c\nthen you will be able to strengthen a\nNormal-type move by unleashing Z-Power![VAR 0114(000C)]
5	Moving right along...[VAR 0114(000C)]
6	Ah, yes. First, there is one thing I forgot\nto mention.[VAR 0114(000C)]
7	The Totem Pokémon![VAR 0114(000C)]
8	In every locale where a captain holds his or\nher trials, you will encounter a particularly\r\nstrong Pokémon, like [VAR 0101(0001)] just now.[VAR 0114(000C)]
9	And during battles against such Pokémon, they\nmay [VAR FF00(0001)]summon allies [VAR FF00(0000)]to shore up their offense.\c\nIt’s not a tactic often seen in other regions.\c\nPerhaps Pokémon in Alola are simply more\ninclined to help one another?[VAR 0114(000C)]
10	Since you have managed to defeat the\nTotem Pokémon and proved yourself, you can\r\nnow try to catch any of the Pokémon you find\r\nhere in this cave.\c\nIn fact, have some Great Balls.[VAR 0114(000C)]
11	And here, let me see to your Pokémon after all\nof their hard work in there![VAR 0114(000C)]
12	If we’re done here, I have something interesting\nI’d like to show you. Come with me to Route 3.[VAR 0114(000C)]
120
0	Greetings.\nCaptain Ilima here.[VAR 0114(000C)]
1	As you travel around the islands of Alola, you\nwill find captains’ barricades here and there.[VAR 0114(000C)]
2	These barricades help mark areas where\nparticularly strong Pokémon can be found.\c\nAnyone can pass through them, of course, if\nthey are escorted by a strong Trainer.\c\nThose attempting the island challenge can pass\nthe barricades, as long as they clear the trials.[VAR 0114(000C)]
3	Are you ready?\c\nThen behold the power of a captain![VAR 0114(000C)]
4	Voila!\nYour world just got a little bigger.[VAR 0114(000C)]
5	I am the only captain here on Melemele Island,\nmeaning my trial is the only one here.[VAR 0114(000C)]
6	Now that you have cleared the trial, please\ninform our island kahuna, Hala![VAR 0114(000C)]

0	Hey there, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nOooh, looking at the expression on Ilima’s face,\nI’d say you cleared your first trial, yeah?[VAR 0114(0005)]
1	Guess I better give you a little reward...\nTime to learn about [VAR FF00(0001)]Z-Power[VAR FF00(0000)]. Woo![VAR 0114(0005)]
2	Watch and learn, cousin![VAR 0114(0005)]
3	[~ 3]
4	[~ 4]
5	[~ 5]
6	[~ 6]
7	Phew! Z-Powers heap all of a Trainer’s feelings\nonto a Pokémon, yeah,\r\nwhich totally wears you out!\c\nUsing Z-Power once per battle\nis all a team can handle, yeah.[VAR 0114(0005)]
8	Oh, so is that why you’ve been looking so\nragged, Professor?[VAR 0114(000C)]
9	No! It’s like I was hit with Amnesia!\c\nI forgot that I lost Lillie somewhere on Route 3!\c\nThink you could spare some time to help me look\nfor her, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0005)]
10	I can also look around where I think she might\nhave wandered off to.[VAR 0114(000C)]
11	Thanks, cousin.\nLet’s split up and find her, yeah![VAR 0114(0005)]
122
0	Nebby!\nNebby, come back![VAR 0114(0006)]
1	Ah...\n[VAR 0100(0000)]...[VAR 0114(0006)]
2	Nebby...\c\nIt got out of my bag again...[VAR 0114(0006)]
3	But why would it want to go in that cave...?\c\nAnd right after it got into so much trouble\non the bridge, too...\c\nWhat if a wild Pokémon attacks it?\nIt doesn’t have any moves it can use to battle![VAR 0114(0006)]
4	Here, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nLet me heal your Pokémon for you...[VAR 0114(0006)]
5	I always carry lots of Potions on me to keep\nNebby healthy.\c\nThat’s the best I can do, since I’m not a real\nTrainer or anything...[VAR 0114(0006)]
6	Pew!
7	Oh, you![VAR 0114(0006)]
8	Pew?
9	Thank you, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0006)]
10	And I should thank [VAR 0101(0001)], too.\nHere, let me at least do this...[VAR 0114(0006)]
11	You know, I read something interesting in a\nbook once...\c\nIt seems the Pokémon called Oricorio changes\nappearance by feeding on the nectar from\r\ndifferent types of flowers.\c\nIt’s not actually evolving but undergoing a\nso-called “form change.”\c\nIsn’t that interesting? I thought it was, anyway...[VAR 0114(0006)]
12	Pew!
13	Back into the bag, please, Nebby.\c\nI know there aren’t many people around to see\nyou here, but that’s hardly an excuse!\c\nAnd I guess we should be going now...\c\nThe professor will probably be worried after\nthe way we just disappeared on him...[VAR 0114(0006)]
123
0	Pew!
1	Phew...\nRunning around like this sure is tiring!\c\nWhoa! So the people of Alola meet in places\nlike this, too, huh?[VAR 0114(0037)]
2	Calm yourself, Zossie.\nThere is only one thing we are here to confirm.\c\nWe must find someone strong enough to protect\nthe Blinding One.\r\nLet us see if you might be the one![VAR 0114(0036)]
3	I see...\nSo that is a Pokémon battle...\c\nWe had tried to investigate what it meant to\nbattle with Pokémon, but it is quite different\r\nwhen you do it yourself.\c\nAt least it seems that the Poké Ball we tried to\ncreate has worked properly to capture us a\r\nPokémon here in Alola.\c\nAnd I have seen for myself how strong you are,\nyoung Alolan Trainer.[VAR 0114(0036)]
4	So, Dulse, what’re we gonna do?[VAR 0114(0037)]
5	Trainer, you should know that this one here\nwarps away if it is threatened in any way...\c\nAnd the holes that are torn open as a result\ninvite dangerous beings into this world.\c\nBut perhaps things will be all right as long as\nthere are Trainers like you in Alola...[VAR 0114(0036)]
6	What about that [VAR 1100(00FF,0600)]other girl, though?[VAR 0114(0037)]
7	That girl should have nothing to do with our\ninvestigations, nor this Pokémon of hers...\r\nas long as no one is foolish enough to open a\r\npath that could lead here from Megalo Tower.\c\nLet us carry on, Zossie.[VAR 0114(0036)]
8	An elusive target, indeed...[VAR 0114(0039)]
9	Hmm. Soliera.\nTest this one.\c\nI would also like to check the functionality of\nthat Poké Ball we tried making in the image of\r\nthe devices used by these Alolan people.\c\nNow that we have at least succeeded in using\none to capture an Alolan Pokémon specimen.[VAR 0114(0039)]
10	Yes, sir.\nI will do so at once.[VAR 0114(0038)]
11	I see...\nSo that is what a Pokémon battle is!\c\nI suppose if there are strong Trainers like\nyourself around, we may not need to play any\r\ngreat role in this endeavor.[VAR 0114(0039)]
12	So then we do not need to bother with the\n[VAR 1100(00FF,0600)]other girl, I assume...[VAR 0114(0038)]
13	That one you have come to collect...\c\nYou must know that it is able to warp away in\nan instant when threatened.\c\nYou should remember, though, that the holes\nthat are created when it does so leave a path\r\nopen to dangerous beings.[VAR 0114(0039)]
14	Pew?
124
0	Start off by selecting a compatible Z-Crystal\nfrom the Z-Crystals Pocket in your Bag, yeah!
1	Then use the Z-Crystal you chose\non a Pokémon!
2	Z-Crystals are [VAR FF00(0001)]compatible [VAR FF00(0000)]with a Pokémon if it\nknows a move of the same type as the crystal.
3	Have your Pokémon hold Z-Crystals, and you’ll\nbe able to use Z-Power in battles!
4	And don’t worry, you can use your Z-Crystals\nover and over on as many Pokémon as you want!
125
0	He-e-ey, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nOh! And Lillie’s with you, too![VAR 0114(0007)]
1	What are you up to, Hau?[VAR 0114(0006)]
2	Just finished up my trial! Heh![VAR 0114(0007)]
3	Hey, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nI wanna see if I really learned anything from my\ntrial. Let me battle you again![VAR 0114(0007)]
4	So you and me both beat that Totem Pokémon,\nhuh, [VAR 0100(0000)]?\c\nLooks like we’re getting pretty strong!\c\nAnd I’m not stopping now. I’m gonna use\nthis momentum to beat my old gramps, too![VAR 0114(0007)]
5	Hey there, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nKnew I could count on you, yeah!\c\nThanks for tracking Lillie down for me![VAR 0114(0005)]
6	What’s this then?\nHau, you finished your first trial, too?\r\nI bet you used some stylin’ moves, yeah?[VAR 0114(0005)]
7	Heh heh, yeah...\nAll thanks to [VAR 0101(0001)]![VAR 0114(0007)]
8	Hala’s probably rubbing his hands together in\nglee right about now, oh yeah![VAR 0114(0005)]
9	What do you mean?[VAR 0114(0006)]
10	It’s all a part of the trials, yeah?\c\nAfter you clear one island’s trials, you gotta\nbattle that island’s kahuna![VAR 0114(0007)]
11	Taking on the island kahuna in battle is called\nthe [VAR FF00(0001)]grand trial[VAR FF00(0000)]!\c\nFor someone like me who’s researching Pokémon\nmoves, nothing could be better than the chance\r\nto see some more fierce Pokémon battles! Woo![VAR 0114(0005)]
12	I don’t know about fierce...[VAR 0114(0007)]
13	I’ll be the judge of that!\nCome on! Back to Iki Town!\c\nCatch that Tailwind and blast through Route 3![VAR 0114(0005)]
14	[~ 14]
15	[~ 15]
16	It seems to me...that Trainers can always find\na path to happiness as long as they have their\r\nPokémon with them. It’s a very nice way to live.[VAR 0114(0006)]
126
0	I’m lookin’ forward to seeing what moves you\nand your Pokémon will pour your soul into...\r\nnow that you’ve gone and cleared your first\r\ntrial, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
1	It’s true... I’m not a Trainer, so I’m sure I don’t\nreally understand how hard it must have been...\r\nbut even I think it’s a great achievement.[VAR 0114(0006)]
2	Pew!
3	Yes, yes... We all know how you feel!\nBut stay inside your bag, please![VAR 0114(0006)]
4	The Melemele kahuna is strong, cousin!\c\nHe’s a Trainer who can use [VAR FF00(0001)]Fighting-type[VAR FF00(0000)]\nPokémon to the fullest, yeah.\c\nMight not be a bad idea to work on those\nFlying- or Psychic-type moves![VAR 0114(0005)]
127
0	[~ 0]
1	Ho![VAR 0114(0008)]
2	I have been expecting you.\c\nAllow me to properly greet the young\nadventurers embarking on their island challenge.\c\nI am Hala, the kahuna of Melemele Island.[VAR 0114(0008)]
3	Shall we begin?\c\nThe final trial here on Melemele Island will be a\nPokémon battle against me, the kahuna!\c\nIt is known as the grand trial![VAR 0114(0008)]
4	Your spirit appears to be ready! However, your\nPokémon must also be healthy if they are to\r\nunleash their full power in battle![VAR 0114(0008)]
5	Yes! It seems that both you and your Pokémon\nare prepared to combine your mental and\r\nphysical strengths to unleash your full power![VAR 0114(0008)]
6	Well, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nYou have been entrusted with the\nSparkling Stone by Tapu Koko!\c\nNow show me you and your partner\n[VAR 0101(0001)]’s full power![VAR 0114(0008)]
7	Well, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nYou have been entrusted with the Sparkling\nStone by Tapu Koko!\c\nNow show me you and your partner\n[VAR 0101(0001)] and your team’s full power![VAR 0114(0008)]
8	Old Hala here will also be going all out!\nLet the grand trial begin![VAR 0114(0008)]
9	...Hmmph![VAR 0114(0008)]
10	The results come as no surprise to me.\c\nWhat a fine Trainer...and what fine Pokémon, too![VAR 0114(0008)]
11	Tapu Ko-ko-ko!
12	Ho! And our mighty Tapu Koko agrees![VAR 0114(0008)]
13	Hmmph! Perhaps Tapu Koko is hoping that a\nday may come when you will grow strong\r\nenough to battle it as well...[VAR 0114(0008)]
14	Accept this Z-Crystal! It allows Trainers to\nshare their power with their partner Pokémon![VAR 0114(0008)]
15	Observe, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nIf you wish to use the Fighting-type Z-Power,\nmove your arm like this...\r\nthen bend your hips like this and pose![VAR 0114(0008)]
16	Now then, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nWith this victory...\c\nyou have cleared all of the trials of Melemele\nIsland, the first of Alola’s islands!\c\nThe Melemele stamp is proof of\nyour accomplishments. With it, Pokémon up to\r\nLv. 35, even those you received in a trade,\r\nwill obey you![VAR 0114(0008)]
17	The moon in the daytime...\nThe sun at night...\c\nNow to see if you can pour your heart into\nsomething that cannot be seen but is very\r\nmuch real.\c\nAs you continue on your island challenge,\nconsider what makes up the people and\r\nPokémon that you meet: both what you\r\ncan see and what you cannot.\c\nYou will surely meet Tapu Koko again someday.[VAR 0114(0008)]
128
0	Moo-aaarrr!
1	Whoa there, Tauros![VAR 0114(0008)]
2	I’ve got an idea!\c\nHow about I set you up so you can ride my\nTauros whenever you’d like?\c\nNo reason why he shouldn’t get to enjoy the\nisland challenge, too![VAR 0114(0008)]
3	Moo-raaarrr!
4	I’ll take care of all the little things you’ll need in\norder to ride a Pokémon, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0008)]
5	You obtained a [VAR FF00(0001)]Ride Pager[VAR FF00(0000)]!
6	Why don’t you hop on there?[VAR 0114(0008)]
7	The world looks a bit different from atop a\nmighty Tauros, eh?[VAR 0114(0008)]
8	See, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nHere in Alola our Pokémon lend us their strength\nand let us ride about on them![VAR 0114(0008)]
9	Let me explain some of the gear I gave you...\c\nYour Ride Pager is a tool that lets you summon\na Ride Pokémon.\c\nAccording to the instructions, you need only \n“press the [VAR FF00(0001)]Y Button[VAR FF00(0000)] to turn on your\r\nRide Pager! Use the B Button to dash!”[VAR 0114(0008)]
10	And your Riding Wear will be the special outfit\nyou wear when riding Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0008)]
11	Have a little romp around Alola with Tauros\nhere. I’m sure you’ll be charmed by him![VAR 0114(0008)]
12	When you use your Ride Pager, Ride Pokémon\nwill kindly come running to help you wherever\r\nyou may be![VAR 0114(0008)]
129
0	Congratulations, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nYour performance has been a delight ever since\nI first laid eyes on you at the Trainers’ School.[VAR 0114(000C)]
1	Aren’t Z-Powers lovely?[VAR 0114(000C)]
2	I’m amazed that you won without\neven using your Z-Power.[VAR 0114(000C)]
3	Oh, I know! Why not stop by the Alola Photo\nClub for a commemorative photo?\c\nWith Tauros, you can be down to Hau’oli City\nin no time at all.[VAR 0114(000C)]
4	Very well then, off on your island challenge you\ngo! May the future bring you happiness![VAR 0114(000C)]
130
0	With a little help from Tauros, [VAR 0100(0000)],\nyou’ll be able to smash right through those big\r\nrocks on Route 1![VAR 0114(0008)]
1	[~ 1]
2	All right! I got a little something for you, too![VAR 0114(0005)]
3	False Swipe is a move that will leave your\nopponent with 1 HP when you attack.\c\nKeep on catching more and more Pokémon,\nyeah, and let Rotom learn all about ’em![VAR 0114(0005)]
4	But first, you’ve gotta go let your mom know\nwhat you’re up to.\c\nWhen you’re done with that, head on down to\nthe Marina in Hau’oli City. Oh yeah![VAR 0114(0005)]
5	Oh! If you’re heading into Hau’oli, you should\ntotally check out the Shopping Mall!\r\nAnd the Alola Photo Club, too![VAR 0114(0007)]
6	What do you mean?[VAR 0114(0006)]
7	Pew?
8	You know! The one Ilima mentioned!\nHe totally had the right idea.\c\nYou should go to the Alola Photo Club and take\na special photo to remember clearing your first\r\ngrand trial![VAR 0114(0007)]
9	Good thinking, Hau!\c\nAnd once you finish your grand trial, you’ll be\ndoing the same thing, yeah?[VAR 0114(0005)]
10	Heh heh! I sure hope so, but first...\c\nCome on, Tutu!\nDon’t go too easy on me now![VAR 0114(0007)]
11	You’re all getting so strong already, yeah...\nI can’t wait to see how much more you’ll grow.[VAR 0114(0005)]
12	All right, time to get the boat ready.\nLillie, you gonna help me clean it?[VAR 0114(0005)]
13	I guess I am...\nSo I suppose we’ll see you later in Hau’oli City.[VAR 0114(0006)]
14	Um...\c\nI actually wanted to ask a favor of you first,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]. If that’s all right?[VAR 0114(0006)]
15	Sure!
16	What is it?
17	You see...\nNebby is...\c\nIts real home is far away from here.\nAnd I want to help it get home.[VAR 0114(0006)]
18	It’s like I told you before...\nNebby saved my life once when I was in trouble.\c\nNow I want to save it![VAR 0114(0006)]
19	I feel like there’s not much I can do on my own,\nsince I’m not a Pokémon Trainer...\c\nBut if I had a real Trainer like you helping me,\n[VAR 0100(0000)], then maybe...[VAR 0114(0006)]
20	But I probably shouldn’t ask a near stranger to\nhelp, right?\c\nI know it’s just my own wish and it has nothing\nto do with you...[VAR 0114(0006)]
21	Of course I’ll help!
22	Yeah, I don’t know...
23	Oh, thank you so much. I’m so glad!\nI really didn’t know what else to do![VAR 0114(0006)]
24	Then I suppose...\c\nThe two of us will be heading to the next island\nas well![VAR 0114(0006)]
25	Pew!
26	I...I understand.\c\nUm, but if you ever do learn anything that you\nthink might help Nebby get home...\r\nI’d really appreciate it if you could tell me.\c\nI’ll do my best to look for clues on the next\nisland on my own.\c\nAnd maybe I’ll see you there.[VAR 0114(0006)]
27	Pew!
28	[~ 28]
29	[~ 29]
30	[~ 30]
31	You will grow even stronger from now on!\c\nAfter all, you have true partners who you can\nrely on as you walk your path together![VAR 0114(0008)]
32	If you could beat my gramps, [VAR 0100(0000)]...\nthen there’s no way I can lose this battle![VAR 0114(0007)]
131
0	Oh! Hello, Trainer!\nLooks like you’ve got a Z-Power Ring.
1	Here at the Alola Photo Club, you can take\nphotos with your favorite Pokémon as you\r\nstrike your favorite poses!
2	You should definitely give it a try.\nAfter all, you came this far already!
3	Oh? Don’t give up on me now!\nWe haven’t even taken your photo yet!\c\nAre you sure you want to quit?
4	Yeah, let’s at least take one snapshot to\ncommemorate all you’ve done on Melemele!
5	Well, come back anytime that you get the\nchance and we can take your photo then.\c\nI’ll give you a little something special so you\ncan check out your photos anytime, too!
6	Oooh!\nI like your photo!\c\nI’ll give you a little something special so you\ncan check out your photos anytime, too!
7	You got a [VAR FF00(0001)]Photo Album[VAR FF00(0000)]!
8	Once you’ve taken a picture, you can also\ndecorate it with special decorations, too.\r\nIt really adds some pizzazz, so give it a try!
9	And as you visit more places, Rotom will help\nyou out with capturing more backgrounds that\r\nyou can use when you are taking photos, too!\c\nDefinitely come to take more photos as you\nexplore the islands during your island challenge!
10	Open up your Photo Album from the X menu,\nwhich you can open just by pressing !
11	Once you open your Photo Album, you can\ndecorate your photos with stickers and more.
12	Add some pizzazz to really make them shine!
13	If you choose to share your jazzed up photos\nfrom your Photo Album...
14	Then everyone who comes to play in your\nFestival Plaza can see them, too!
15	Would you like to move right ahead to placing\nsome stickers on any photos you took?
16	Are your photos all simply amazing now?
17	If you want to decorate any photos later, you\ncan always add stickers from your Photo Album!
18	Then let’s open up your album...
132
0	Hey, there you are, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0007)]
1	I bet you and [VAR 0101(0001)] got a great shot\ntogether at the photo club, right?[VAR 0114(0007)]
2	Now it’s time for our next stop!\nAkala Island, here we come![VAR 0114(0007)]
3	You’re not taking a photo?
4	Yeah, let’s get going!
5	Man, once I get started with all the poses and\nthe stickers and things, I can’t stop myself!\c\nI’ll spend ages making sure [VAR 0101(0001)] is\nlooking awesome, so I should hold off on taking\r\nany photos of my own for now.\c\nWouldn’t want to leave you bored and hanging![VAR 0114(0007)]
6	Trrrrilll!
7	Nrarrr!
8	Bwon!
9	Just think...\nI wonder what kind of trials we’ll face next![VAR 0114(0007)]
133
0	Good timing, [VAR 0100(0000)] and Hau!\nI’ve just got the old girl all ready to set sail.[VAR 0114(0005)]
1	Oh. Yeah.\nSo, about that, Professor...[VAR 0114(0007)]
2	I was thinking that I’d really like to head to\nAkala Island with Mantine!\c\nAnd I want to see [VAR 0100(0000)] take a shot\nat Mantine Surfing, too![VAR 0114(0007)]
3	Mantine?
4	But the boat?
5	Shoots, yeah! The Mantine from Big Wave Beach\non Route 2. You saw them, right?[VAR 0114(0007)]
6	Aw, come on!\nI really want to ride on a Mantine! Don’t you?\c\nAnd I’m totally not just saying that because the\nprofessor’s boat is such a junk heap, either.[VAR 0114(0007)]
7	Right...\nWell, Hau, it’s all up to you!\c\nThe island challenge is all about journeying\ntogether with Pokémon, after all![VAR 0114(0005)]
8	Yeah!\nSo I’ll see you on Akala Island, Professor!\c\n[VAR 0100(0000)]! If you wanna go together,\nI’ll be at Route 2’s Big Wave Beach![VAR 0114(0007)]
134
0	Um... I was hoping to ask a favor of you,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]. If that’s all right?[VAR 0114(0006)]
1	Sure!
2	What is it?
3	You see...\nNebby is...\c\nIts real home is far away from here.\nAnd I want to help it get home.[VAR 0114(0006)]
4	It’s like I told you before...\nNebby saved my life once when I was in trouble.\c\nNow I want to save it![VAR 0114(0006)]
5	I feel like there’s not much I can do on my own,\nsince I’m not a Pokémon Trainer...\c\nBut if I had a real Trainer like you helping me,\n[VAR 0100(0000)], then maybe...[VAR 0114(0006)]
6	But I probably shouldn’t ask a near stranger to\nhelp, right?\c\nI know it’s just my own wish and it has nothing\nto do with you...[VAR 0114(0006)]
7	Of course I’ll help!
8	Yeah, I don’t know...
9	Oh, thank you so much. I’m so glad!\nI really didn’t know what else to do![VAR 0114(0006)]
10	Then, I suppose...\c\nThe two of us will get to see one another on\nAkala Island next, too![VAR 0114(0006)]
11	Pew!
12	I...I understand.\c\nUm, but if you ever do learn anything that you\nthink might help Nebby get home...\r\nI’d really appreciate it if you could tell me.\c\nI’ll do my best to look for clues on Akala Island\non my own.\c\nAnd maybe I’ll see you there.[VAR 0114(0006)]
13	Pew...
135
0	Oh? So the two of you were friends?
1	That’s right, we are!\nWe’re doing our island challenges together![VAR 0114(0007)]
2	And next up, we want to go to Akala Island![VAR 0114(0007)]
3	So I take it you beat old Hala?\c\nOur Mantine would be thrilled to have a couple\nof able Trainers like you riding them!
4	[~ 4]
5	[~ 5]
6	[~ 6]
7	[~ 7]
8	[~ 8]
9	Great! So, like...\nHow do we actually do Mantine Surfing?[VAR 0114(0007)]
10	Just go up to a Mantine and introduce yourself.
11	Do you think Mantine have rough skin like\nSharpedo?\r\nOr are they all slippery and slidey?[VAR 0114(0007)]

9	I’ll be all right.\nI can see the building from here, after all.\r\nEven I shouldn’t be able to lose my way. I think.[VAR 0114(0006)]
10	Pew!
11	And you! I’ll have you stay in your bag, mister.[VAR 0114(0006)]
12	I’ve heard that there is a group of terrible\npeople around who try to steal Pokémon.\r\nA group called Team Skull.\c\nWe need to be careful if we want to escape the\nnotice of such a collection of villains...\c\nIsn’t that right, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0006)]
13	I wonder if the guardian of Akala will also be\ninterested in you, [VAR 0100(0000)]...\r\nYou are the one who got that Sparkling Stone.[VAR 0114(0006)]

0	Stop right there![VAR 0114(0030)]
1	Ah ha ha! We didn’t mean to surprise you.\nYou must be doing your island challenge.[VAR 0114(0030)]

3	My name’s Sina!\nA beautiful name for a beautiful lady![VAR 0114(0026)]
4	We’re here seeing the sights in Alola.\c\nIts unique tradition of island challenge...\nIt’s pretty fascinating, I’ve got to say.[VAR 0114(0027)]
5	Oh, I’ve got an idea!\nYou and Dexio should battle![VAR 0114(0026)]
6	And why should we do that?\c\nThough I might as well test my skills.\c\nIs that all right with you?[VAR 0114(0027)]
7	Then I’ll let my partners go wild![VAR 0114(0027)]
8	If you’d ever like to battle, I’d be willing.\nJust ask.[VAR 0114(0027)]
9	Oh, I’ve got an idea!\nWhy don’t you test your skills with me?[VAR 0114(0026)]
10	OK! Let’s get this show on the road![VAR 0114(0026)]
11	OK, I’ll wait till you’re up to the challenge of my\nawesome team![VAR 0114(0026)]
12	That’s what I would expect from a Trainer\ndoing the island challenge.\c\nI felt the bond between you and your Pokémon![VAR 0114(0027)]
13	I get it... Facing trials helps you grow close to\nyour team.\c\nI think that’s absolutely wonderful![VAR 0114(0026)]
14	I feel like I’ve been able to have a glimpse of\nthe island challenge!\c\nLet me heal your Pokémon as thanks![VAR 0114(0026)]
15	You and your Pokémon are the ultimate team!\nNo doubt about it!\c\nThis battle reminded me of us in the past...and\nthat group of five young Trainers.\c\nTake this as a little token of our new friendship![VAR 0114(0027)]
16	Maybe training yourself up a bit on Route 4 will\nhelp you understand your Pokémon even better.\c\nWe’ll be taking our leave now!\nBon voyage![VAR 0114(0026)]
144
0	Hey! [VAR 0100(0000)]! Glad I ran into you...\c\nSo we can see who’s stronger now!\c\nI got a Z-Power Ring from my gramps, too,\nafter making it through his grand trial![VAR 0114(0007)]
1	Having a battle in a place like Paniola Town\nfeels like we’re in a real old-fashioned Western\r\nshowdown or something, right?\r\nThis is so cool!\c\nThough if we’re real honorable cowboys, we’ve\ngotta make sure our teams are healthy first.[VAR 0114(0007)]

6	Bwon!
7	Right then. Here. I’ll share my bit of good luck\nwith you, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0007)]
8	You know how the Totem Pokémon are all, like,\nsurrounded by some aura of power?\c\nIf you use a Dire Hit on your Pokémon and\nmanage to land a critical hit, that aura won’t\r\nmean a thing!\c\nYou might wanna try using some of those\nRotom Powers when you’re fighting a totem, too![VAR 0114(0007)]
9	You know, Pokémon battles are just, like,\nsometimes you win, sometimes you lose.\c\nBut you’re only really a loser if you don’t have\nany fun while you’re at it. Right?\c\nAnyway, I’m heading off to Paniola Ranch![VAR 0114(0007)]

3	The Moomoo Milk from Paniola Ranch is the\nbest. It’s so rich and creamy when you use\r\nit in white sauce and other things...\r\nMmm! The taste can’t even be described![VAR 0114(000E)]
4	Oh, by the way! Since I was lucky enough to run\ninto you here, I’ll do you a little favor.[VAR 0114(000E)]
5	Stoutland was registered to your Ride Pager!
6	See, Stoutland can sniff out items for you that\nare buried in the dirt where you can’t even\r\nsee them!\c\nWhen you’re riding Stoutland, pressing  to use\nthat Stoutland [VAR FF00(0001)]Search[VAR FF00(0000)] is what it’s all about![VAR 0114(000E)]
7	Get up there and try it! There’s all kinds of\nstuff lying around waiting for you to find it.\c\nAnd Stoutland will bark louder and louder the\ncloser it gets to some item buried in the ground![VAR 0114(000E)]
8	If you go all the way down Route 5, you’ll come\nout on Brooklet Hill. My friend Lana is up there,\r\nso say hi to her for me if you see her![VAR 0114(000E)]

1	Are you even taking this seriously?[VAR 0114(0030)]
2	I am! So seriously!\nI’m seriously enjoying it![VAR 0114(0007)]
3	...Enjoying it?[VAR 0114(0030)]
4	You can enjoy Pokémon battling when you put\neverything you have into it...\r\nwhich clearly you haven’t.[VAR 0114(0030)]
5	Whoa!\nHey, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0007)]
6	This guy is plenny scary![VAR 0114(0007)]
7	You’re [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0030)]
8	Yeah, that’s me
9	Nope, not me
10	Who?
11	Hmph. Not very cautious.\c\nEven some Pokémon have a better sense of\nself-preservation than you apparently do.[VAR 0114(0030)]
12	Hmm. So you have enough sense to be wary.\nNot bad...[VAR 0114(0030)]
13	I’m Gladion.\c\nMe and my partner, Type: Null, are training to\nget stronger...\r\nWe have to get stronger!\c\nThough most of our time these days goes to\nworking for Team Skull as their muscle.[VAR 0114(0013)]
14	Battle me.\nI won’t take no for an answer.[VAR 0114(0013)]
15	Hmph... \nIt’s not like me to slip up like that.[VAR 0114(0013)]
16	I’ve got to keep fighting stronger opponents.\nLooks like I’m still not ready...[VAR 0114(0013)]
17	What?
18	Strong opponents?
19	That kid there.\nHis Pokémon aren’t weak.[VAR 0114(0013)]
20	And sure, it’s fine to enjoy battling...[VAR 0114(0013)]
21	But this brat...\c\nhe’s just using that as an excuse not to try\nhard because he can’t beat the kahuna.\r\nBecause he can’t beat Hala when he’s serious![VAR 0114(0013)]
22	You know my gramps?\nWait. So you think I’m strong?[VAR 0114(0007)]
23	Awww, look at you, little Gladion!\nAren’t you just a real cool guy? Heh heh heh...[VAR 0114(0031)]
24	I guess it’s no surprise a homeless kid would\nturn out spineless, too, huh?\c\nNo worries! We’ve got enough backbone to\ncover for you![VAR 0114(0032)]
25	Just give it up already.[VAR 0114(0013)]
26	Huh?[VAR 0114(0031)]
27	You know you can’t beat me.\nYou’ll just get your Pokémon hurt for no reason.[VAR 0114(0013)]
28	They’re good Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0013)]
29	We came all this way, and for what?\nFor a big fat waste of our time, thanks to you.\c\nIf you hadn’t gotten in our way, we could’ve\nstolen the Totem Pokémon from Brooklet Hill![VAR 0114(0032)]
30	Let’s get out of here. Look, the Murkrow are\ncrying, and it’s time we should be flying.[VAR 0114(0032)]
31	Listen up good, Gladion...\nThe boss does like you. That’s true.\c\nBut you’re just some hired help we keep around\nfor when we need you.\c\nYou aren’t part of Team Skull, not really.\nAnd you never will be. Got it? You better get it.[VAR 0114(0031)]
32	Thanks, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nAnd [VAR 0101(0001)], too.\r\nYou both gave it your all![VAR 0114(0007)]
33	Phew... Looks like I’ve gotta train up my team if\nI’m gonna take on the trial at Brooklet Hill next!\c\nHere, [VAR 0100(0000)], take these with you.\nWe’re gonna beat this island challenge![VAR 0114(0007)]
34	Doing squats really uses all your muscles!\nMy legs are shaking so hard, I can’t move!
35	I’m not doing Alolan sumo! I’m not!\nI’m definitely not trying to be like Kahuna Hala!

2	So, brave trial-goer, I would like to ask you to\ninvestigate that splashing there and find out\r\nwhat exactly is causing it.\c\nI won’t ask you to swim out there, of course.\nI have a lovely gift for you instead.[VAR 0114(000D)]
3	Lapras was registered to your Ride Pager!
4	If you climb atop Lapras there, you will be able\nto travel over bodies of water.\c\nThat’s right. You’ll even be able to reach those\nsplashes and see what is going on there.[VAR 0114(000D)]

2	Oh my...\c\nSo it was Wishiwashi kicking up all that water?\c\nEven a little Wishiwashi can make such\nbig waves...[VAR 0114(000D)]
3	*splash splash*
4	Oh me. What is that?\c\nI can hear wild splashing from over there...\nIt sounds even larger than what we just saw.[VAR 0114(000D)]

2	Now look over there.\nDo you see that?[VAR 0114(000D)]
3	Whatever is kicking up such lovely splashes\nmust be rather big...\c\nA strapping young Swimmer, perhaps?\nOr an amazing Pokémon specimen?[VAR 0114(000D)]
4	Are you going somewhere?\c\nI would still like you to investigate those\nsplashes in the water.[VAR 0114(000D)]
5	[~ 5]
152
0	Oh my.\c\nSo it was another Wishiwashi that was kicking\nup all that water?\c\nHmm. How unfortunate.\nIt wasn’t a strapping young Swimmer after all...[VAR 0114(000D)]
1	*splash splash splash splash*
2	Oh my word!\c\nNow what is that? Even more furious splashing?\nIt sounds as big as a Wailord.[VAR 0114(000D)]

4	Let’s go investigate it, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(000D)]

2	That’s right. Didn’t you notice? You passed\nthrough the captain’s barricade by my side.\r\nWhich means that you will undergo my trial![VAR 0114(000D)]
3	To clear my trial, you must defeat the great\nTotem Pokémon known as the lord of the ocean![VAR 0114(000D)]
4	That spray of water you can see there!\nThat is where you will probably find the totem.\c\nAnd perhaps those Wishiwashi you battled\nagainst will also want their revenge...\c\nDefeat whatever comes at you and prove your\nstrength to me![VAR 0114(000D)]

Def\nor two or perhaps a Dire Hit.\c\nDo not let your guard down.\nThe totem is not to be trifled with.[VAR 0114(000D)]

0	What is it, [VAR 0100(0000)]?\c\nDo you need to leave so that you might prepare\nyourself better for my trial?[VAR 0114(000D)]
1	I understand.\c\nIt’s unfortunate, of course, but go prepare\nyourself so you can come try again.[VAR 0114(000D)]
2	Defeat the totem that is causing all that sea\nspray, and prove your strength to me.\c\nAnd...well, you may find that using Grass- or\nElectric-type moves will be to your advantage.\c\nOr you could always resort to using an X Sp. Def\nor two or perhaps a Dire Hit.\c\nDo not let your guard down.\nThe totem is not to be trifled with.[VAR 0114(000D)]
3	So you’re back, [VAR 0100(0000)]...\c\nThough you bowed out of my trial once.[VAR 0114(000D)]

1	Lapras is trembling...
2	Gwoooh!!!
157
0	Very well done, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nPlease come back this way.[VAR 0114(000D)]
1	I...I must say that I find myself at an\nimpasse here.\c\nAll of the Wishiwashi that I so diligently trained\nup were defeated, and that is very frustrating...\c\nbut of course I cannot let your completion of my\ntrial go uncelebrated, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(000D)]
2	You were amazing, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nTruly impressive.\c\nPlease take this.[VAR 0114(000D)]
3	You do know what this is, don’t you?\c\nWatch. This is how you use Waterium Z.[VAR 0114(000D)]
4	And that’s not all I can offer you.\c\nHere. This is a Lana original.\nOne of my own handmade fishing rods.[VAR 0114(000D)]
5	This is how you use my fishing rod:\c\nWhen you want to fish for Pokémon, look for\npiles of rocks in the water.\r\nFish like to hide in the shadows there.\c\nWhen you see your bob dip under the water,\nyou have a bite. But you won’t for long.\c\nThe Pokémon will struggle to get away, so\npress  as soon as you see the “!” mark.[VAR 0114(000D)]
6	If you want to catch any of the Pokémon you\nfish up for your team, I recommend Dive Balls.[VAR 0114(000D)]
7	[~ 7]
8	You did?!
9	Did you really?
10	Well, what do you think?[VAR 0114(000D)]
11	You did a fine job today.\c\nShall I see you back to the Pokémon Center on\nRoute 5?[VAR 0114(000D)]
12	Good. Let’s be going then.\nAnd you can always do a spot of fishing later.[VAR 0114(000D)]
13	I understand. Oh yes, I understand all too well.\c\nThe siren call of the sea...\nand the urge to fish up something wonderful![VAR 0114(000D)]
158
0	Next is Kiawe’s trial.\nIt will take place at Wela Volcano Park.[VAR 0114(000D)]
1	Oh. And that reminds me...\nDid you see any Sudowoodo by Paniola Ranch?\c\nThey were causing some trouble for people, so I\ngave them a little dose of Z-Power using my\r\nWaterium Z. Just a little lesson for them.\c\nI wonder how they will react now that they see\nthat you have Waterium Z, too?\c\nHeh.[VAR 0114(000D)]
159
0	Woooooohhhhhh!!
1	Wait, those were Pokémon?! I totally thought\nthey were just plants![VAR 0114(0037)]
2	Calm yourself, Zossie. Those must have been\nthe Pokémon known as Sudowoodo.\c\nA most interesting Pokémon.\nI wish I could research them further.\c\nThey must be mimicking plant life in an attempt\nto avoid their weakness—water. [VAR 0114(0036)]
3	These Alolan Pokémon... \nThey’re all so unique. It’s truly fascinating...\c\nBut battling them is not easy.[VAR 0114(0036)]
4	So I challenge you with one we are accustomed\nto...Poipole![VAR 0114(0036)]
5	I knew it!\nYou can’t just challenge people like that!\c\nSorry, Mis[VAR 1100(00FF,0103)]ters Trainer.\nBut do you think a battle would be OK?[VAR 0114(0037)]
6	That’s what I thought. It’s way too sudden![VAR 0114(0037)]
7	Our research is insufficient to define what it\nmeans to be a Pokémon Trainer...\c\nWe’ll never be able to stop Necrozma like this...[VAR 0114(0036)]
8	I will warn you now. \nPoipole cannot be found anywhere in Alola.[VAR 0114(0036)]
9	I must research the reason for my defeat...[VAR 0114(0036)]
10	Your Z-Power Ring...\nIt’s so pretty when it shines like that![VAR 0114(0037)]
11	What are you suggesting? That it might be like\nthe beautiful light our ancestors once saw?[VAR 0114(0036)]
12	How should I know?\c\nSee you around, Trainer![VAR 0114(0037)]
13	Oho! These Sudowoodo are fascinating\nPokémon as well, worthy of being a research\r\ntopic all on their own!\c\nThe way they mimic plants in order to avoid\nwater... How very interesting.[VAR 0114(0039)]
14	Just as our research suggested, Captain Phyco.[VAR 0114(0038)]
15	Indeed... We must gather data about Pokémon\nif we want to win Pokémon battles, after all.[VAR 0114(0039)]
16	That being said, there is no need for us to use\nthese odd Alolan Pokémon.\c\nSoliera, if you would be so kind...[VAR 0114(0039)]
17	Trainer, could I ask you to face me in a\nPokémon battle?[VAR 0114(0038)]
18	I would very much like you to face me, so I will\nwait over here.[VAR 0114(0038)]
19	I have created a few on my own, but these\nPoké Balls are the most peculiar devices![VAR 0114(0039)]
20	Then... I will face you with my Poipole.[VAR 0114(0038)]
21	Thank you very much...\c\nI was able to understand Poipole better, but it\nseems my Pokémon battle skills leave much\r\nto be desired...[VAR 0114(0038)]
22	That Z-Power Ring of yours...\nIts light feels somehow nostalgic.[VAR 0114(0039)]
23	Do you think it is the same light our ancestors\ngazed upon? The light said to have come from\r\nthe Blinding One?[VAR 0114(0038)]
24	Who can tell? Yet it is our duty as the Ultra\nRecon Squad to find that out.[VAR 0114(0039)]
25	[~ 25]
26	Hey!\nLooks like you passed Lana’s trial, huh?\c\nAnd you got that Waterium Z, huh?\nThe Sudowoodo can’t take that at all!
27	Those weird people had weird Pokémon to\nmatch! Well, I guess it’s not a big deal.\c\nThe weird people are gone, and so are the\nSudowoodo! Now everyone can use the road\r\nagain. Here’s a little something for you in return!
28	I wonder if maybe those Sudowoodo ran off to\nthe Battle Royal Dome to try to get stronger...\c\nYou know about the Battle Royal Dome, right?\nThat’s the place where you enter Battle Royals!
160
0	Ni-hiii!
1	You there, Trainer.\nCan you come to my aid?[VAR 0114(0030)]

11	Life in the big city sure is something else.\c\nPokémon thieves roam about brazenly...[VAR 0114(000B)]
12	Hmm, I leave that one to you.[VAR 0114(000B)]
13	We’re not thieves, yo!\nIt’s a legitimate business![VAR 0114(0031)]
14	We got straight messed up in Melemele...\ngot exiled to Akala...\c\nbut we ain’t goin’ out like that![VAR 0114(0032)]

19	Time for us to break out, yo!\nGotta tell y’all peace out, yo![VAR 0114(0032)]
20	I’m not gonna keep telling you this...\nexcept when I keep telling you this!\c\nYou better listen to what my homie says\nand drill it into that thick skull of yours!\r\nSeriously! You’d better not forget, numskull![VAR 0114(0031)]
21	You’ll be fine getting home?[VAR 0114(000B)]
22	Floo-oooon...
23	Glad to see that Drifloon will get home\non her own.[VAR 0114(000B)]
24	I’ve got you to thank for that.\nGive me your name, Trainer.[VAR 0114(000B)]
25	[VAR 0100(0000)], eh?\nThat’s a fine name.\c\nI like the way you handled yourself in battle.[VAR 0114(000B)]
26	Mudsdale and I are always wandering all\nabout Alola to try to achieve our goals, so\r\nperhaps we’ll meet again someday.\r\nI am indebted to you for your aid, after all.[VAR 0114(000B)]
27	Ni-hiii!
28	Ah yes.\c\nYou might want to try your hand at a \n[VAR FF00(0001)]Battle Royal [VAR FF00(0000)]or two, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nMudsdale here thinks you’d be well suited to it,\ngiven how strong you are.[VAR 0114(000B)]

6	Yes, even back at Wela Volcano Park my\nvaunted Salazzle didn’t stand a chance.[VAR 0114(000F)]
7	Nor did the Wishiwashi that I had trained\nso carefully...[VAR 0114(000D)]
8	All right, you’ve cleared all three of\nAkala’s trials!\c\nYou even managed to get through my\ntrial, and I’d say it’s a real doozy!\r\nHere! A gift for such an inspiring young Trainer![VAR 0114(000E)]
9	You received a Z-Crystal from Mallow!
10	You obtained a Grass-type Z-Crystal!\nThe Grassium Z is yours![VAR 0114(000E)]

12	Since you’ve cleared my trial, [VAR 0100(0000)],\nI want you to help me train some Pokémon from\r\nhere in Lush Jungle.\c\nHere, have some Nest Balls![VAR 0114(000E)]

1	My Marowak and I are students of the ancient\ndances that have been passed down in Alola\r\nfor generations.[VAR 0114(000F)]
2	The trial of Kiawe...\c\nYou will find that it is a bit different than the\ntrials you have faced to this point, but of\r\ncourse, you will attempt it, right?[VAR 0114(000F)]
3	Of course!
4	Not right now
5	Well, [VAR 0100(0000)], it looks like you have\nfailed my trial.[VAR 0114(000F)]
6	In my trial several Pokémon will appear, and you\nwill indeed battle them.\c\nBy carefully observing their dance, you can\navoid unnecessary battles. Never forget that\r\nthis is one way to approach the trial.[VAR 0114(000F)]
7	The Totem Pokémon Marowak is a Fire- and\nGhost-type Pokémon.\c\nIt has many weaknesses: Water, Rock, Ground,\nDark, and even Ghost type.[VAR 0114(000F)]

5	The left Marowak
6	Show me again!
7	B-but how?!\c\nThat was truly spectacular!\nAnd to add to the spectacle...\c\nCome, Marowak![VAR 0114(000F)]
8	Wa-wak!
9	Marowak was so pleased by your right answer\nthat it simply had to battle you![VAR 0114(000F)]
10	Astounding!\nIt is astounding how wrong you are!\c\nCome, Marowak![VAR 0114(000F)]

9	Wak wak wak!
10	Marowak, the Totem Pokémon of the volcano\npark, has appeared!
180
0	Whoa!\c\nS-spectacular!\c\nWith your keen observations, you were able to\nsee even fine differences in our dances!\c\nAnd you defeated the Totem Pokémon with\nsuch ease![VAR 0114(000F)]
1	The Totem Pokémon protected this Firium Z.\nNow it is yours.[VAR 0114(000F)]
2	This is how you use the Fire-type Z-Power![VAR 0114(000F)]
3	Thank you, my dear Marowak![VAR 0114(000F)]
4	For when you meet a Pokémon that you would\nlike to make your companion, take these![VAR 0114(000F)]
5	What’s more!\c\nYou may now use the Ride Pokémon Charizard.\c\nCharizard will lend you his strength, and you\nwill be able to go anywhere you have been in\r\nan instant.[VAR 0114(000F)]
6	Charizard was registered to your Ride Pager!
7	The Firium Z...you should show it to the\nTrial Guide outside the captain’s barricade at\r\nthe bottom of the mountain.\c\nIt is time for us to return to our dance.\nThe feelings of the Alolan people and our\r\nPokémon, and the true nature of Z-Power...\c\nThe answers lie in our dance! And so we must\ndance on![VAR 0114(000F)]
181
0	You...\c\nYou’ve passed Kiawe’s trial! Well done! OK!\c\nSo that means you can now ride on Charizard...[VAR 0114(0030)]
1	In that case, why don’t I tell you about a great\nway to play with the Pokémon in your Boxes![VAR 0114(0030)]
2	You ready for this?\c\nPress  to open the X menu, and then tap on\n[VAR FF00(0001)]Poké Pelago[VAR FF00(0000)] to take off, OK?[VAR 0114(0030)]
3	I’ll be waiting for you and your Pokémon to visit![VAR 0114(0030)]
182
0	Wow!\nThe aura readings are going crazy![VAR 0114(0037)]
1	Hey! [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0037)]
2	Interesting... So this is what you call a tunnel...\nI would like to investigate it further if we only\r\nhad the time to do so...\c\nGreetings, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nIt seems your island challenge is going well?[VAR 0114(0036)]
3	It appears that my guess was correct: battling\nthe Totem Pokémon, which are wrapped in aura,\r\nis having an effect on you as well.[VAR 0114(0036)]
4	And those Z-Moves also envelop your ally\nPokémon in aura, do they not?\c\n...Are you able to fully control aura then?[VAR 0114(0036)]
5	Sure I can
6	Not really
7	I suppose it does not matter to us either way.\c\nBut once...long, long ago...our world was also\nawash in wondrous light, like the light of those\r\nZ-Moves that you can use...[VAR 0114(0036)]
8	Dulse?\nIt’s about time for our meeting.[VAR 0114(0037)]
9	Yes.\c\nWe will be getting the aid of a scientist who is\nwell educated in the ways of Pokémon.\c\nWe will need his help to find ways we might use\nour technology to achieve our goals.[VAR 0114(0036)]
10	What is this?\c\nThe numbers keep climbing in my aura readings.[VAR 0114(0038)]
11	Ah. [VAR 0100(0000)]...\nI bid you Alola.[VAR 0114(0038)]
12	Hmm... This fine tunnel...\c\nIt is most fascinating to learn that there are a\nvariety of construction methods made possible\r\nby the Pokémon that lend their aid to humans.[VAR 0114(0039)]
13	Trial-goers clear many trials.\c\nIt is only natural, perhaps, that such a Trainer\nwould exude aura after coming in contact with\r\nso many Totem Pokémon awash in aura.[VAR 0114(0039)]
14	Oh, and you, young [VAR 1100(00FF,0403)]manlady...\nYou seem to have even more Z-Crystals than\r\nwhen last we met.\c\nDo you hope to master the Z-Moves?[VAR 0114(0039)]
15	Sure I do
16	Not really
17	That wondrous light that appears when a\nZ-Move is used...\r\nWe once had such light in our world as well.\c\nAnd it was precious to us, even if we did not\nuse it to battle with Pokémon...[VAR 0114(0039)]
18	Captain Phyco.\nIt is nearly time.[VAR 0114(0038)]
19	While our technology is advanced, it must be\nmodified to work to its fullest with Pokémon.\c\nWe must go now to meet with a scientist who is\nversed in the ways of Pokémon, or we will have\r\nno hope of achieving such a thing.[VAR 0114(0039)]
183
0	You there![VAR 0114(0030)]
1	Oh, excuse me! I am a scientist.\nMy name is Colress.\c\nThe theme of my research is:\n“Bringing out the potential of Pokémon.”\c\nWhat brings out the power of Pokémon is...[VAR 0114(002B)]
2	I believe that is—the bond they share with\ntheir Trainers![VAR 0114(002B)]
3	And thus my attention is drawn to Trainers\nlike yourself...\c\nTrainers bound to their Pokémon through the\npower of the Z-Power Ring![VAR 0114(002B)]
4	Now that I think of it, I never asked your name.\c\n...[VAR 0114(002B)]
5	[~ 5]
6	[~ 6]
7	[~ 7]
8	Z-Power...\c\nIs it the true potential that I seek?\nDoes it surpass the Mega Ring?\c\nApparently, there are uninhabited islands for\nPokémon called [VAR FF00(0001)]Poké Pelago[VAR FF00(0000)] here in Alola.\c\nAlola is fascinating! I believe that I will stay in\nAlola for some time![VAR 0114(002B)]
9	Well then, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nI hope you will excuse me.\c\nI’ve had quite the curious request made to me\nby a couple of most oddly dressed strangers.[VAR 0114(002B)]
10	[VAR 0100(0000)], is it?\nI’ll remember your name.\c\nTo commemorate our encounter, let me give\nyou a TM.[VAR 0114(002B)]
11	If you’re able to utilize Flame Charge fully,\nyou’ll be able to have a great battle with the\r\ntotem in the next trial...the trial in Lush Jungle.[VAR 0114(002B)]
184
0	Woo! What’s that sweet smell I smell, driftin’\nmy way?! Could it be a tasty Mallow Special?[VAR 0114(0005)]
1	I heard you cleared Mallow’s trial, yeah?\nAll right then, I have a present for you!\c\nThis little TM right there is Smart Strike—a move\nthat will never miss![VAR 0114(0005)]
2	There’ll be all kinds of discoveries and new\nexperiences to make your adventure brighter![VAR 0114(0005)]
3	There’s a facility, yeah, that I want you to\ngo check out on your island challenge.\c\nThe Dimensional Research Lab!\nLet’s get on over there with Extreme Speed![VAR 0114(0005)]
185
0	Guess I should congratulate you on clearing all\nthree of Akala Island’s trials, too.\c\nCongrats! Looks like it’s time for you to take on\nKahuna Olivia’s grand trial![VAR 0114(0005)]
1	Olivia is an expert user of Rock-type Pokémon.\nYou’re gonna wanna catch some Grass-type\r\nPokémon in Lush Jungle to add to your team.[VAR 0114(0005)]
2	Whenever you’re ready for the grand trial, come\nsee me at the Dimensional Research Lab!\c\nIt’s down past Route 6, yeah, but just ask\nRotom if you need some help![VAR 0114(0005)]
186
0	Hey, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Howzit!\nI knew I heard your footsteps![VAR 0114(0007)]
1	I finished up Mallow’s trial and ate down every\nlast bite of that Super Mallow Special of hers!\c\nBoy, that was good enough to break the mouth![VAR 0114(0007)]
2	You heading to the Dimensional Research Lab?\nYou just keep on going straightaways this way.\r\nMaybe I’ll catch you there later![VAR 0114(0007)]
187
0	Hey, hey! [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nYou ever heard of that Festival Plaza thing?\c\nI guess it’s like a festival or something where\nlots of people get together and have fun?[VAR 0114(0007)]
1	You!\nI can tell you’ve been to Festival Plaza before!
2	You!\nI can tell you’ve never visited Festival Plaza!
3	No worries! I’ll teach you how to visit it.\nI just heard about it for the first time, too...\c\nLet’s see, I think she said...\nYeah, you’re supposed to open up your X menu,\r\nthen tap on Festival Plaza![VAR 0114(0007)]
4	Festival Plaza seems pretty good, huh?\c\nEven my old gramps tried it out.\nIt’s great to get to meet so many different folks!\c\nNow I’m gonna go have some fun with my team![VAR 0114(0007)]
5	What’d you think, [VAR 0100(0000)]?\nPretty fun, right?\r\nIt’s great to get to meet so many different folks!\c\nNow I’m gonna go have some fun with my team![VAR 0114(0007)]

3	Heh...\nI was just acting like I was [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0006)]
4	You...you always seemed to end up getting hurt,\nNebby.\c\nSeeing that pained me just as much as if I was\nthe one being hurt.\c\nBut if I could become as strong as Hau and\n[VAR 0100(0000)] are...\r\nthen maybe things would be different...[VAR 0114(0006)]
5	Pew?
6	Oh![VAR 0114(0006)]
7	Um, oh, [VAR 0100(0000)]. Hello.\nI feel like it’s been a while since we last met.\c\nTh-there’s a laboratory here that studies the\ndimensions, did you know?\c\nAnd the professor is waiting to meet you![VAR 0114(0006)]
8	How...how were your trials?\nIt must be quite trying to do three in a row.[VAR 0114(0006)]
9	It was no problem
10	It was really tough
11	Goodness, really? It wasn’t any trouble for you\nto tackle all three of Akala Island’s trials?\c\nI suppose that explains it.\c\nThe reason you look so content and understood\nby [VAR 0101(0001)] there, I mean.[VAR 0114(0006)]
12	I would think so...\nBut still! You made it through all three!\c\nI think that explains it.\c\nThe reason you look so content and understood\nby [VAR 0101(0001)] there, I mean.[VAR 0114(0006)]
189
0	Hey there, honey![VAR 0114(0005)]
1	Oh, hi![VAR 0114(0030)]
2	This here’s Professor Burnet.\c\nShe runs the Dimensional Research Lab, yeah...\c\nAnd she’s also my wife![VAR 0114(0005)]
3	You’re [VAR 0100(0000)], right?\nLillie told me about you.\c\nShe said you were the reliable sort.[VAR 0114(001B)]
4	Three months ago...\c\nI found Lillie lying on a beach.\c\nCosmog in her bag also unconscious.[VAR 0114(001B)]
5	Hm?\nNo Hau today?[VAR 0114(001B)]
6	Hau? He’s out doing his own thing.\c\nBut he’ll be the real deal someday... He could\neven become a kahuna, just like old Hala\r\nbefore him![VAR 0114(0005)]
7	You really think so?![VAR 0114(0007)]
8	Whoa-ho!\c\nWell, yeah, I really do.[VAR 0114(0005)]
9	Good to see you again, Hau!\nIt’s been a while since I last saw you.[VAR 0114(001B)]
10	Anyhow, I brought [VAR 0100(0000)] here\nbecause I wanted you to tell h[VAR 1100(0000,0202)]imer about some of\r\nthe mysterious phenomena here in Alola.[VAR 0114(0005)]
11	I’d be happy to!\c\nThe mysteries of Alola, huh?\nThen you’ve got to mean...[VAR 0114(001B)]
12	the [VAR FF00(0001)]Ultra Wormhole[VAR FF00(0000)]![VAR 0114(001B)]
13	It’s extremely rare, but sometimes a hole opens\nin the sky over Alola.\c\nIt appears that this rift leads to a different\nand unknown dimension.[VAR 0114(001B)]
14	The reason that people think there may be a\nmysterious dimension is because of the legends\r\nof fearsome Pokémon appearing from the Ultra\r\nWormhole.[VAR 0114(001B)]
15	Pew...
16	It’s very weak as proof, but I can’t ignore it.\c\nThere is also plenty of evidence already in the\nPokédex for the existence of different\r\ndimensions, right?[VAR 0114(001B)]
17	Fearsome Pokémon...?[VAR 0114(0007)]
18	Even normal wild Pokémon sometimes attack\npeople, right?\c\nBut the Pokémon that appeared from the Ultra\nWormhole went way beyond that.[VAR 0114(001B)]
19	They were called Ultra Beasts...\nAnd they were feared.\c\nIf the stories are to be believed, the guardian\ndeities of the islands fought desperately\r\nagainst them.[VAR 0114(001B)]
20	But like I said, it’s all legends and folktales.\nIt’s hard to know how much is true.[VAR 0114(001B)]
21	But I would be very happy if I could somehow\nunravel the mysteries of the Ultra Wormhole by\r\nstudying the dimensional disturbances![VAR 0114(001B)]
22	We’ve recorded several known relationships\nbetween Pokémon and different dimensions\r\nin books. You can find them on the bookshelves\r\nin this lab.[VAR 0114(001B)]
190
0	You want to know what happened three\nmonths ago?\c\nWell, I’d wanted to learn more about Nebby...\c\nI mean, about Cosmog.\c\nSo I decided to come speak to Professor Burnet.\c\nBut I got lost along the way...and ended up\nwandering about until I collapsed on the shore...[VAR 0114(0006)]
1	She listened to my story, staying up all night to\nhear it all. And then she even got her husband,\r\nProfessor Kukui, to lend me his loft to stay in...\c\nAnd she told him to help me investigate\nNebby’s origins, too.\c\nProfessor Burnet has been so kind, and she’s\nstill helping me try to find a way to get Nebby\r\nback to its own home...[VAR 0114(0006)]
2	She’s been like...like a real mother to me.[VAR 0114(0006)]
191
0	Hey there, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Go see what you\ncan learn from everybody![VAR 0114(0005)]
1	How about that, [VAR 0100(0000)]?\c\nIf Ultra Beasts are really out there, I wonder\nwhat kinds of moves they can use...[VAR 0114(0005)]
2	You’ve finished all three of Akala’s trials. Woo!\nAnd now comes the big match against Olivia—\r\nthe island kahuna!\c\nIt’s the biggest and baddest trial of them all\nhere on Akala—the grand trial![VAR 0114(0005)]
3	Good luck!\c\nOlivia’s house is past Diglett’s Tunnel.\nIt’s in Konikoni City![VAR 0114(001B)]
4	I still have some things I want to talk to\nProfessor Burnet about, so I’ll stay here.[VAR 0114(0006)]
5	Being able to go to more places really makes it\nfeel like you’re growing along with your partner\r\nPokémon, huh? It’s pretty great![VAR 0114(0007)]

0	Hey, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nSo you’ve made it through all three captains’\ntrials, yeah?\c\nThen you should go meet Kahuna Olivia!\nShe lives in the town past Diglett’s Tunnel.[VAR 0114(0007)]
1	Diglett’s Tunnel is...let’s see...\nFrom here, it’s kinda near the PMC!\c\nIt’s easy to walk right past it, though, so keep\nyour eyes peeled![VAR 0114(0007)]
2	Now it’s malasada time for me![VAR 0114(0007)]
194
0	Hmm? Oh, [VAR 0100(0000)], wasn’t it?[VAR 0114(0009)]
1	This cave really is something, y’know?\c\nIt’s overflowing with these Pokémon called \nDiglett, and they are getting really out of hand.\r\nMediocre Trainers can’t even get through![VAR 0114(0009)]
2	So, how’s your island challenge going?\nLet me see which crystals you’ve earned.[VAR 0114(0009)]
3	Couldn’t wait to come see me, hmm?\c\nBut tackle Brooklet Hill first.\nIt’s right past Paniola Town.[VAR 0114(0009)]
4	OK, you’re doing all right! How’s that Waterium Z\nworking out for you?\c\nJudging by how well you and your team get\nalong, I bet you guys can do some real damage\r\nwith it!\c\nOK, [VAR 0100(0000)], Kiawe’s trial is next!\nOff to Wela Volcano Park you go![VAR 0114(0009)]
5	It looks like you’ve tackled everything but\nAkala Island’s last trial in Lush Jungle!\c\nJust relax and have fun with it. Your Pokémon\nwill be happier that way, too.[VAR 0114(0009)]
6	Oh hey, since you’re here on Akala...\c\nHave you made it out to our Dimensional\nResearch Lab yet?\c\nTraveling about for your island challenge is\nabout more than just trials, you know.\r\nHave a look around while you’re at it.[VAR 0114(0009)]
7	Ooh, look at you, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Nice work!\nI see you’ve even passed Mallow’s trial.\c\nIt’s about time you had some fun with me!\nThe Diglett have settled down, too.\c\nIf you are as strong as you appear, you should\nbe able to make it through this cave.[VAR 0114(0009)]
8	At the other end of it, you’ll find Konikoni City.\c\nThat’s where my shop is. I’ll see you there![VAR 0114(0009)]
195
0	Phew...\c\nWith Olivia in charge, we’ve finally managed to\nmake some headway against those Diglett.
1	Oh! Alola!\c\nWe’re members of the Aether Foundation.\nWe work to support Pokémon conservation.
2	It seems like Team Skull was responsible for\nthe Diglett in this cave getting so riled up and\r\nbringing them all up to the surface.
3	Oh, Team Skull is this group of troublemakers,\nyou see...\c\nThey seem to delight in interfering with Trainers\nand their Pokémon.
4	Diglett normally live in elaborate systems of\nunderground tunnels that take years to dig out.\c\nWe’re here to ensure that they return to their\ntunnels and let people pass through here\r\nwithout having to fight so many Pokémon.
5	Some of the Diglett are still stuck on or near the\nsurface, though, so be careful!
196
0	Ahh, no way...\c\nJust when things were startin’ to heat up, yo,\nI got surrounded by Diglett and beat up, yo!\c\nYo, since when can Diglett use Beat Up?![VAR 0114(0031)]
1	I’m so mad that now I want to beat up on\nsome fools.\c\nDon’t be mad ’cause you were the fool who was\ndumb enough to be here right now.[VAR 0114(0031)]
2	[VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0007)]
3	Aue! I was wondering who you were playing\naround with without me, and it’s Team Skull![VAR 0114(0007)]
4	You want some? That’s how we say hello!\nNice knowing you, punks![VAR 0114(0031)]
5	Yo, step off! Enough with the beating up, yo![VAR 0114(0032)]
6	We may not be trying to take over the world or\nnothing, but we’re still hard as bone out here![VAR 0114(0031)]
7	See you on the flip side![VAR 0114(0007)]
8	Man, [VAR 0100(0000)], when I fight with you...\nIt’s like even my Pokémon feel more at ease!\c\nYou really are some kind of Trainer.\c\nThat’s it! I’ve just gotta give you something![VAR 0114(0007)]
9	Max Ethers will restore all the PP to one of your\nmoves, you know? Pretty great, right?\c\nIt’s pretty much like those Roto PP Restores\nyou can get from the Roto Loto, yeah![VAR 0114(0007)]
10	Now I’m gonna go have some more fun with\nthose Diglett! See ya![VAR 0114(0007)]
197
0	Oh?!\nA trial-going Trainer, you are?[VAR 0114(0030)]
1	Looker is my name.\c\nI travel the world, and many lands do I visit for...\nmy own private reasons.[VAR 0114(001F)]
2	Alola is a nice place and so very peaceful.\nMost ideal for a vacancy.\c\nI was just in Konikoni City, where I got a most\nunusual stone at Ms. Olivia’s shop![VAR 0114(001F)]
3	No one here is so terrible as to try to create a\nnew world...or liberate all Pokémon from their\r\nTrainers. Yes, peaceful indeed...[VAR 0114(001F)]
4	Though concerns I have about those reported\nsightings of the infamous Pokémon mafia...[VAR 0114(001F)]
5	Ah! Forgive me for keeping you.\c\nI will give you this Thunder Stone if you forgive\nmy rudeness. I bought three without thinking![VAR 0114(001F)]
6	Do have a good adventure, my trial-going\nyoung Trainer friend![VAR 0114(001F)]
198
0	Nopass!
1	The Pokémon is holding a letter...\c\nYou take the letter and read it.
2	Olivia here. This is Probopass.\nIt watches the shop whenever I’m away.\nI know I asked you to meet me here, but there’s\nbeen a change of plans. Come meet me at the\nRuins of Life past Memorial Hill, when you can.
3	Pass?
4	Medicine?
5	That’s for me?
6	Pass-pass!
7	Will you read the letter that Probopass holds?
8	Pass-pass!
199
0	Team Skull!\nGive back that Pokémon!
1	Don’t give me trouble!\nI’ll reduce you to rubble![VAR 0114(0031)]
2	That’s right! We’re gonna sell this Pokémon to\nget rich, and we won’t make no bones about it!\c\nIf you want it back, you’re gonna have to take it![VAR 0114(0032)]
3	Stand firm!\nThink of what the president would say![VAR 0114(0030)]
4	That’s what you say, Chief!\nBut you don’t lift a finger!
5	Why, I am the Aether Foundation’s last\nline of defense!\c\nWhat would become of the foundation if\nsomething were to happen to me now?[VAR 0114(0030)]
6	Ah! Here is a promising young Trainer!\c\nFight in my stead, child, and rout these Team\nSkull ruffians.\r\nI will bestow honor upon you, if you do![VAR 0114(0030)]
7	You ready?\nCuz I was born ready, yo![VAR 0114(0031)]
8	That loss was pathetic!\nYour moves were so kinetic![VAR 0114(0031)]
9	We don’t need this Pokémon anyway!\nTake it then! Good luck and good riddance![VAR 0114(0032)]
10	Phew...
11	Lo-o-ow?
12	Thanks, kid!
13	Yes, indeed. You are a trial-goer, aren’t you?\nYou’re a splendid Trainer.[VAR 0114(0030)]
14	I am deeply impressed!\c\nI’d like to reward you by showing you something\ntruly astounding.\c\nOnce you have finished your grand trial, come to\nHano Grand Resort and I will take you to see\r\na wondrous place.[VAR 0114(0030)]
15	Thank you for helping us out.\nI really owe you!
16	I’m so glad there are nice young Trainers like you\naround. Good luck on your island challenge!
200
0	So, you’re the one Gladion was talking about?\c\n...Hmph.\nYou don’t look like anything special to me.[VAR 0114(0030)]
1	I’m Plumeria.[VAR 0114(0018)]
2	I help keep Team Skull together.\nI’m like a big sister to all these numskulls.\c\nYou have realized what idiots all these guys\nare, right?[VAR 0114(0018)]
3	But don’t you think some dummies are cute\nin their dumbness?\c\nYou know what I mean, right? You picking on\nmy cute, dumb brothers and sisters is really\r\nannoying me![VAR 0114(0018)]
4	Hmmph!\nYou’re pretty strong. I’ll give you that.\c\nBut mess with anyone in Team Skull again, and\nI’ll show you how serious I can get.[VAR 0114(0018)]
201
0	[VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(001B)]
1	Lillie got lost again, so I brought her\nhere to you.\c\nShe couldn’t even find her way to the Tide\nSong Hotel on her own!\c\nShe said she saw Team Skull and tried to avoid\nthem. That’s why she got lost.[VAR 0114(001B)]
2	Now I’ve gotta go. The Masked Royal has a\nmatch, and there’s no way that I’m missing it![VAR 0114(001B)]
3	That Masked Royal...\c\nWhat do you think he looks like under that\nmask, anyway?[VAR 0114(001B)]
202
0	I came here for Nebby.\c\nThough...\c\nas you saw, I didn’t come here myself so much\nas I was brought here with the\r\nprofessor’s help...[VAR 0114(0006)]
1	Oh! Look at poor [VAR 0101(0001)].\nLet me heal it for you, won’t you?[VAR 0114(0006)]
2	Within these ruins waits the guardian deity of\nAkala Island...\r\nThis is Tapu Lele’s ruin.[VAR 0114(0006)]
3	Pew!
4	You! I know you tried to drag me along to the\nRuins of Conflict on Melemele Island, too...[VAR 0114(0006)]
5	Why are these ruins important to you?\nWhat do the guardians mean to you?[VAR 0114(0006)]
6	Just think what would have happened if you\nhadn’t been there back then...[VAR 0114(0006)]
7	Pew!!!
8	Oh, haven’t I seen you with Kukui?[VAR 0114(0009)]
9	Yes, my name is Lillie.\nI work as Professor Kukui’s assistant.\c\nAnd this is [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0006)]
10	Oh! Sorry, I never even asked your name before,\ndid I?\c\nTapu Lele summoned me here to clean up\nthe ruins.[VAR 0114(0009)]
11	[VAR 0100(0000)]...thanks for getting\nto know the people and Pokémon of Alola.[VAR 0114(0009)]
203
0	All right, then!\c\nYou’ve completed the trials of all three captains\nhere on Akala Island.\c\nNow you face the grand trial of the kahuna—me![VAR 0114(0009)]
1	Get ready for your hardest Pokémon battle yet\non Akala![VAR 0114(0009)]
2	I’d love to!
3	Not yet
4	Great! We’re gonna give you guys everything\nwe’ve got!\c\nAnd my partners are all adorable, rugged little\nRock types![VAR 0114(0009)]
5	Fine! I don’t want to win just because you\nweren’t prepared well enough.[VAR 0114(0009)]
6	If it’s all right with you, [VAR 0100(0000)], I think\nNebby and I would like to watch, too.[VAR 0114(0006)]
7	Diamonds only sparkle after coal is pushed\nto its absolute limit.[VAR 0114(0009)]
8	You guys are the best!\c\nHere. The Rock-type Z-Crystal...\nThe Rockium Z is all yours![VAR 0114(0009)]
9	The Rock-type Z-Power...you have to move like\nthis to draw it out!\c\nWatch carefully, because the hip movement\nis crucial![VAR 0114(0009)]
10	Use it well.\c\nThe Rock type...\c\nIt’s hard. Sturdy. Rugged and physically strong.\c\nSo nothing like me at all! I guess opposites really\ndo attract.[VAR 0114(0009)]
11	Pew?
204
0	Pew!
1	You look very pleased, don’t you?[VAR 0114(0006)]
2	By the way, Lillie, this might be a weird\nquestion, but...\c\nWhy even come to the Ruins of Life if you’re not\na Trainer?[VAR 0114(0009)]
3	Oh. Because of Nebby...\c\nIt’s not originally from here, and I want to help\nit get back to its home...\c\nBut I don’t have any idea how to do that...\c\nIt seems fond of the ruins for some reason,\nso I keep visiting them and hoping that maybe\r\nI will find some clue to help it...[VAR 0114(0006)]
4	Pew?
5	You certainly don’t see Pokémon like that\nevery day.\c\nTapu Lele may be called the guardian deity of\nour island, but it can also run wild at times.\c\nRegular Pokémon normally avoid the guardians\nat all costs...\c\nUnless they are strong enough to face the\ntapu themselves, that is.[VAR 0114(0009)]
6	Wait, that can’t be right...[VAR 0114(0009)]
7	I think your journey will hold many surprises.\nAnd I hope it holds many joys.[VAR 0114(0009)]
8	I’ll take you back to town, Lillie.\c\nYou’re doing everything you can for your\npartner, even though you’re not a Trainer.\c\nI like that kind of person, so I can’t help but\ngive you a hand![VAR 0114(0009)]
205
0	Aue! You’re Kahuna Olivia!\nI’m Hau from Iki Town!\r\nYou’ve gotta let me battle you![VAR 0114(0007)]
1	Trrrrilll!
2	Nrarrr!
3	Bwon!
4	Oh, hey, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nGuess what?\c\nThis weird green guy from Aether told me to\ncome to Hano Grand Resort once I finished up\r\nwith my grand trial here on Akala.\c\nCrazy, right?[VAR 0114(0007)]
5	Ooh, the Aether Foundation?\c\nI’m not sure what he wants with you,\n[VAR 0100(0000)], but why not go find out?\c\nIf you don’t want to keep him waiting, then\nCharizard should get you there in no time.\c\nThe Hano Grand Resort lies just over the bridge\nnear the Dimensional Research Lab.[VAR 0114(0009)]
6	Th...the Aether Foundation...?[VAR 0114(0006)]
7	U-um! I think I’ll stay here.\nI’d like to see how Hau’s battle goes, too.\c\nEven though I hate to see Pokémon get hurt...\c\nBut I know that both of your Pokémon are\ndedicated to battling beside you two.[VAR 0114(0006)]
8	Maybe I can’t show off all [VAR 0101(0001)]’s and the\nrest of my team’s strengths like my gramps...\c\nBut I’m still gonna do the best that I can do![VAR 0114(0007)]
9	Trrrrilll!
10	Nrarrr!
11	Bwon!
12	You’re just you, right? Everyone is.\c\nAnd what’s wrong with that?!\nWhy should it matter who your family is?\c\nI want to see what it is you kids can do.\nSo, show me your own full power![VAR 0114(0009)]
206
0	So you’ve come at last.[VAR 0114(0030)]
1	Ah. But forgive me.\nI have yet to introduce myself.\c\nYou may call me Faba.\c\nI told you before that I would show you\nsomeplace astounding, right? Well, that\r\nwondrous place is...[VAR FF00(0001)]Aether Paradise[VAR FF00(0000)]![VAR 0114(0030)]
2	Let me tell you about Aether Paradise.\c\nJust as the name suggests, Aether Paradise is a\nveritable paradise for Pokémon that floats far\r\nout in the sea surrounding Alola.\c\nIt is an artificial island, made entirely by human\ntechnology, for the protecting of Pokémon!\c\nOf course I’m an adult who keeps his promises.\nSo I will prove to you that all I’ve told you is the\r\nabsolute truth with a tour of Aether Paradise.\c\nYou will come, won’t you?![VAR 0114(0015)]
3	Good, good. Then you’ll come with me.\nAether Paradise will amaze you.[VAR 0114(0015)]
4	Hmm. Yes.\c\nWell, children are often too frivolous and\naimless to properly think through—\r\nAhem. I mean they value their freedom so.\c\nBut the answer that I want to hear from you is\na resounding “Yes!” Now let’s hear it![VAR 0114(0015)]
5	Wait!\nTake me, too![VAR 0114(0007)]
6	Oh?\nEven Kahuna Olivia has come to see you off?[VAR 0114(0015)]
7	As a kahuna, I look after all the trial-goers who\ncome to my island. They’re like my own children.\c\nNot that I’ve got any—I’ve never even\ngotten married.[VAR 0114(0009)]
8	Listen up, you two.\c\nYour greatest opponent is always yourself.\nYour greatest allies, the Pokémon beside you.[VAR 0114(0009)]
9	Thanks!\c\nAre you coming, too, Professor?[VAR 0114(0007)]
10	I’ve got my own business to attend to.\c\nYou go see all the amazing tech that Aether’s\ndeveloping and tell me about it later, yeah?[VAR 0114(0005)]
11	That’s right. I’ll see you on the next island...\c\nUla’ula Island, yeah?\nThen let’s meet up at Malie Garden![VAR 0114(0005)]
12	Yup! It’s good-bye, Akala Island!\c\nThough I guess we can come back anytime\nwe want to, huh?[VAR 0114(0007)]
13	Then let us enjoy an adventure upon that grand\nvessel that will take us across the high seas!\c\nBy which I mean to say, the ferry.[VAR 0114(0015)]
207
0	Can you believe a big hunk of iron like Aether\nParadise can float in the sea?!\c\nAnd it’s all cuz of the Pokémon holding it up.\nDid you know that, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0007)]
1	I knew that
2	Really?!
3	Awww...\nI thought I finally had one up on you.[VAR 0114(0007)]
4	Knew I could count on you to react![VAR 0114(0007)]

1	Aether Paradise is a facility created for the\nconservation of Pokémon.\c\nIt has been outfitted with all of the latest\ntechnology for this purpose.[VAR 0114(0015)]
2	Downstairs, our teams work on developing new\nPoké Balls and more.\c\nYes, all for the sake of Pokémon conservation.[VAR 0114(0015)]
3	Though you will not be able to use any of your\nPoké Balls within Aether Paradise.\c\nA jamming signal is broadcast throughout the\nfacility to prevent them from functioning.[VAR 0114(0015)]

0	Excuse me, Mr. Faba...[VAR 0114(0030)]
1	Yes, excuse you!\c\nWhat is the meaning of that form of address?\c\nI have a title for a reason!\c\nHow else will anyone know how important I am?[VAR 0114(0015)]
2	Yes...\nBranch Chief Faba...[VAR 0114(0030)]
3	Now, I must go speak with the president about\nour conservation efforts on Akala...\c\nShow these children around, and then take\nthem to meet the president as well.[VAR 0114(0015)]
4	Phew...[VAR 0114(0030)]

6	Nice to meet you
7	Alola!
8	Wait? You know who we are?\nHow’d you know that?![VAR 0114(0007)]
9	One of our employees told me about your\nmeeting on Akala Island.\c\nAnd of course I heard how you helped protect\nthe Pokémon there, too, young Mr. Hau.\c\nThank you very much![VAR 0114(0016)]
10	Let me show you around.\nThe main entrance is up above us.[VAR 0114(0016)]

1	[VAR 0100(0000)]?\c\nYou and Hau are both trial-goers, aren’t you?\nAre you hoping to become champions?\c\nI suppose...\nYou must be around 11, then?[VAR 0114(0016)]
2	Yeah, I am
3	How’d you know?
4	Yeah, I took the first chance I had to join\nin the island challenge once I turned 11!\c\n’Cause someday I really want to be able to\nbeat my gramps...but he’s way too strong!\r\nSo for now I’ll just enjoy my island challenge![VAR 0114(0007)]
5	How...how lovely for you.\c\nI suppose all children must yearn to take a\njourney of their own choosing when they get\r\nto be about your age.\c\nThough you’re hardly just children anymore.\nTrainers are like parents to their Pokémon![VAR 0114(0016)]
6	[VAR 0100(0000)]. Hau.\c\nWould you two like to see the conservation\narea upstairs?[VAR 0114(0016)]

0	Aether Paradise is a safe haven for all Pokémon.\c\nFor this reason, the use of Poké Balls is strictly\nforbidden within the conservation area.
1	Wow![VAR 0114(0007)]
2	We keep Pokémon that have been targeted by\nTeam Skull here...[VAR 0114(0016)]
3	And we also try to support Pokémon that need\na little extra protection.\c\nLike Corsola, for example. They are quite terribly\noverhunted by a Pokémon called Mareanie.[VAR 0114(0016)]
4	I hope you don’t mind if I read a passage from\nmy old Pokédex.\c\nI traveled through Kanto before, when I was\nyounger, you see.[VAR 0114(0016)]
5	“Corsola.\c\n“In Alola, where their natural enemies Mareanie\nare plentiful, many Corsola have stubby\r\nbranches on their heads.”[VAR 0114(0016)]
6	Yeah. My gramps is always saying that nature’s\ngot its cruel side, sure as it gives us blessings.[VAR 0114(0007)]
7	But can the Aether Foundation really protect\nall the Pokémon that’re out there?[VAR 0114(0007)]
8	Nature does have its own balance, of course.\c\nIt can be difficult to judge just how much we\nhumans should try to affect that, can’t it?[VAR 0114(0016)]
9	That’s pretty amazing!\nThe Aether Foundation seems awesome.\c\nBut why’d you bother setting up a branch in\na place like Alola?![VAR 0114(0007)]
10	I couldn’t say...\c\nIt’s hard to know for sure what our president\nis thinking sometimes.[VAR 0114(0016)]
11	If you’d like to meet President Lusamine, she\nshould be here in the conservation area now.[VAR 0114(0016)]
214
0	This is where we look after the Pokémon that\nare commonly known as “regional variants.”[VAR 0114(0016)]
1	There are several species of Pokémon that\nseem to have adapted to the Alola region.\c\nThey have different appearances, and even\ntypes, in Alola than they do in other regions.[VAR 0114(0016)]
2	What is it in the climate and features of this \nregion that is affecting the Pokémon?\c\nWe are trying to determine that by testing\ndifferent parameters, such as the local soil,\r\nwater, and temperature.[VAR 0114(0016)]
3	We’ve been aided in our research by Professor\nOak, who is in Ula’ula, among others...[VAR 0114(0016)]
4	Oh yeah, I remember!\c\nThe Meowth in your house is different from the\nones in Alola, isn’t it, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0007)]
5	Yeah
6	It is?
7	So that’s why! I never knew that Alola was\nso cool like that. Regional variants, huh?[VAR 0114(0007)]
8	Ha ha ha! OK, next time we’re back home,\n[VAR 0100(0000)], we should compare Meowth![VAR 0114(0007)]
9	If you’d like to continue on, I think you will find\nthe president is still in the area.[VAR 0114(0016)]
10	If you’d like to meet President Lusamine,\nshe’s here in the conservation area now.[VAR 0114(0016)]
11	Wow, there are even Pokémon that got done in\nby Team Skull, huh?[VAR 0114(0007)]
215

4	I am the president of the foundation.\nBut please, just call me Lusamine.\c\nI’m so glad that we got to meet.[VAR 0114(0014)]
5	I’m glad there are people like you, who travel\nthe islands to learn more about Pokémon...[VAR 0114(0014)]
6	But there are also those unfortunate\npeople who harm Pokémon for their\r\nown selfish reasons or even for profit.[VAR 0114(0014)]
7	And that is why I am here.\c\nI will be like a mother to all of those poor\nPokémon and shower them with love.[VAR 0114(0014)]
8	Even Pokémon from distant worlds, far from\nthe Alola region, are worthy of my love.[VAR 0114(0014)]
9	Wow, Miss Lusamine!\c\nI don’t know how you do all this!\nYou’re, like, not even that much older than us![VAR 0114(0007)]

3	You poor creature...[VAR 0114(0014)]
4	Venomenon!
5	[VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nCan you distract that thing?\nI’ve gotta get Miss Lusamine outta here...[VAR 0114(0007)]

2	Miss Lusamine!\nAre you OK?![VAR 0114(0007)]
3	That Ultra Beast just now...\c\nIt came from the other end of an Ultra\nWormhole...\c\nIt is a being from another world.\nA world that you know as Ultra Space![VAR 0114(0036)]
4	Why so shocked?\nWas it your first time seeing an Ultra Beast?\c\nThose mysterious creatures that live beyond\nthe Ultra Wormholes, the holes that suddenly\r\nopen in the sky and lead to Ultra Space...\r\nIt would serve you well to remember this.[VAR 0114(0039)]
5	Who the—?!\nSeriously, what’s with that getup?![VAR 0114(0007)]
6	These are my guests. The Ultra Recon Squad.\c\nThey have been giving the foundation advice\nabout the Ultra Beasts.[VAR 0114(0014)]
7	Why don’t you introduce yourselves?[VAR 0114(0014)]
8	...Dulse.[VAR 0114(0036)]
9	And I’m Zossie![VAR 0114(0037)]
10	So we meet again, trial-goer.[VAR 0114(0039)]

12	Ultra Wormholes?
13	Ultra Beasts?
14	We came to the Alola region from another world\nby passing through an Ultra Wormhole.\c\nWe came from a world of darkness, whose light\nwas stolen by the one called Necrozma...[VAR 0114(0036)]
15	Our world is a world without light...\c\nThe light was stolen by a creature known to\nus as Necrozma.\r\nA creature almost like an Ultra Beast.\c\nAnd someday it will come to steal the light of\nAlola as well...like an eclipse that never passes.[VAR 0114(0036)]
16	See, this Necrozma is, like, unbelievably strong!\c\nIt can wield light however it likes, and sure, it\ndoes run wild sometimes, but it also shares this\r\nmysterious light it has with others, too![VAR 0114(0037)]
17	We have also come to the Alola region from\nanother world, via an Ultra Wormhole.\c\nA world of darkness, without light...[VAR 0114(0039)]
18	Our world is wrapped in darkness.\c\nThough it also shone with light once, long ago...[VAR 0114(0039)]
19	There is a creature...known as Necrozma.\c\nIt is able to bestow light upon others, but now it\nruns wild, beyond reason.\c\nWe call it the Blinding One out of respect, but...\c\nI fear that the day may come when Alola loses\nits light to Necrozma.[VAR 0114(0038)]
20	But everything will be fine.\c\nIf this Necrozma, or even an Ultra Beast like\nthe one we just saw, should come to this world\r\nfrom another, the Aether Foundation will be\r\nprepared to protect the light of Alola.[VAR 0114(0014)]
21	Rest easy...\nYou will not need to worry about a thing.[VAR 0114(0014)]

1	O-oh! At once, ma’am![VAR 0114(0016)]
2	I will go to check that none of our poor resident\nPokémon came to any harm.\c\nAnd I need to speak with Mr. Faba about\nexactly what happened downstairs.[VAR 0114(0014)]
3	It may be that our experiments to open an Ultra\nWormhole are not going as well as we’d hoped.[VAR 0114(0014)]
4	I’ll see the two of you to Ula’ula Island, then.[VAR 0114(0016)]

0	I never thought I’d actually get to see the\nUltra Wormhole in my life...\r\nNever mind meeting people from another world!\c\nMan, the surprises just never stop coming!\c\nWe’ve gotta tell Professor Burnet about this the\nnext time we see her.[VAR 0114(0007)]
1	I’m glad you feel that way. What happened\nhere today was a surprise to us as well.\c\nBut I was very glad to get to meet you \nboth. Please take this to remember your visit.\c\nSome malasadas for Hau...[VAR 0114(0016)]
2	Yes! Big Malasadas! Awesome!\c\nIsn’t it crazy how malasadas taste even better\nwhen you eat ’em together with someone else?[VAR 0114(0007)]
3	Yes... I think I know what you mean.\c\nMeals always taste better when you share them\nwith the ones you love.\c\nAnd for you, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nA TM for the move Psychic...[VAR 0114(0016)]

2	I’ve got an idea, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nLet’s have a battle![VAR 0114(0007)]
3	Sure
4	Why?
5	I want my Pokémon to get a deep breath of\nthis fresh new air!\c\nDon’t worry. I’ll make sure both our teams are\nin fighting form first.[VAR 0114(0007)]
6	Bwah! That battle took my breath away!\nI can’t breathe the fresh air that way![VAR 0114(0007)]
7	We’re supposed to meet up with the professor,\nright? Where was it? Malie Garden?[VAR 0114(0007)]

3	Aww!\nAre you just trying to bring me down or what?[VAR 0114(0007)]
4	All right!\nThen let’s go full powered on this one![VAR 0114(0007)]
5	You know what, [VAR 0100(0000)]?\nYou should take this Lycanium Z, too!\c\nIt came as a set with those Big Malasadas that\nMs. Wicke gave me, but I don’t plan on adding\r\nany Lycanroc to my team or anything.[VAR 0114(0007)]
6	You and your Pokémon looked like you were\nhaving a blast, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nI guess it’s like my gramps said...\c\nGo beyond winning and losing, and learn to find\njoy in any battle...then you’ll find that you’re\r\ngetting strong before you even know it![VAR 0114(0007)]
7	Trrril!
8	Mraw!
9	Brrril!
10	What? You mad that I still don’t seem to be\ngetting all that much stronger?\c\nI sure hope not! Me and my partner oughta\nbe, like, totally in sync with one another![VAR 0114(0007)]
11	We’ll get there, buddy.\c\nNow I guess we should go try to track down\nProfessor Kukui in Malie Garden, right?[VAR 0114(0007)]
224

6	Woo! You got to see the Ultra Wormhole and an\nUltra Beast? And folks from another world?!\r\nThat IS amazing, oh yeah!\c\nSounds like an even better reason to train\nhard, yeah, on your island challenge![VAR 0114(0005)]
7	Maybe someday we’ll all be able to go through\nthe Ultra Wormhole![VAR 0114(0005)]
8	All right! Your next trial is up on Mount Hokulani!\c\nYou can catch the bus to get there.\nJust head to the bus stop on Route 10, yeah?[VAR 0114(0005)]
9	You guys can go ahead without me, Professor.\c\nI’ve got a hot date with a malasada shop!\c\nI’m gonna get my Pokémon some treats so they’ll\nreally start to like me![VAR 0114(0007)]

7	Right... Of course...\c\nI just thought maybe you’d met with her.\nI’m sorry for asking you something so strange.
8	Um, anyway...\nWhat I really wanted to ask about was...
9	You want to go to the ruins?
10	Is it about Nebby?
11	Yes. I want to take Nebby to visit Ula’ula’s ruins,\nbut they are located deep in a large desert.\r\nI don’t want to ask that much of you.[VAR 0114(0006)]
12	Right now, I’m planning to visit Malie Library.\c\nThere’s a book that I want to look for there.\nMaybe you’d even be willing to help me?[VAR 0114(0006)]
13	I know that Malie Library is here within the\ncity of Malie somewhere...\r\nEven I should be able to find it. I can do this![VAR 0114(0006)]
14	Pew!
226

2	Pew...
3	But the woman working at the store did tell me\nwhere to find the library!\r\nSo I guess you could say it was all for the best.\c\n...Though the library was actually right past the\napparel store, if I’d just kept going.[VAR 0114(0006)]
4	Ne-e-eh!

0	Check it out, [VAR 0100(0000)]!
1	You see that steep, jutting, majestic peak\nright over there?
2	That’s Mount Lanakila...\nthe highest peak in Alola!
235
0	Hey there![VAR 0114(0005)]
1	You’re still as fired up as ever, eh, “Royal”?[VAR 0114(0030)]
2	Ha! [VAR 0100(0000)], lemme introduce you.\nThis is Molayne.\c\nHe runs the observatory here and also\nmanages PC Boxes, but he’s not\r\nHokulani’s captain.[VAR 0114(0005)]
3	But I was the captain once, my masked friend.[VAR 0114(001C)]
4	It’s [VAR 0100(0000)], right? Thanks for coming\nall the way up Hokulani to visit us.\c\nOur Captain Sophocles is a rather busy young\nman, I’m afraid.\c\nAlways calculating comets’ paths or updating\nthat Festival Plaza thing of his...[VAR 0114(001C)]
5	[~ 5]
6	[~ 6]
7	[~ 7]
8	If you want to be introduced to the Masked\nRoyal, though...\c\nWell, that’s something I could definitely help you\nwith right here and now.[VAR 0114(001C)]
9	Yeah, I think [VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]she’s even stronger than we were\nat this point of our island challenge![VAR 0114(0005)]
10	One more thing, cousin—the name’s Kukui!\nWho’s this Masked Royal you’re talking about?![VAR 0114(0005)]
11	Just...think about that favor I asked you, yeah,\nMolayne? I want you to seriously consider it.\c\nI guess I should head back to Malie Garden.\c\nEven Hau should be done eating malasadas by\nnow, yeah?\c\nI’ll make sure he makes it up here, too.[VAR 0114(0005)]
12	That guy’s as interesting as ever. My old buddy![VAR 0114(001C)]
13	Here’s a little something to remember our\nmeeting by, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(001C)]
14	Behold![VAR 0114(001C)]
15	Cutting sharpness! Unyielding power!\nYes, this move has them both!\c\nAnd it is what you need to know to draw\nforth the Steel-type Z-Power.\c\nI gathered these Z-Crystals when I was on my\nown island challenge back in my own day,\r\nadventuring with Kukui and my Pokémon in\r\nsearch of strength.\c\nYou should go ahead and use it now.[VAR 0114(001C)]
16	Now go on inside and tour our observatory\nas you like![VAR 0114(001C)]
17	And if you’re ready for the real trial, Captain\nSophocles can be found in the head’s office![VAR 0114(001C)]
236
0	You’re getting close to your goal...\c\nI imagine that you must have come here to\nattempt the trial, huh?[VAR 0114(0010)]
1	[~ 1]
2	[~ 2]
3	So... Uh...[VAR 0114(0010)]
4	Do you like Festival Plaza?[VAR 0114(0010)]
5	Yes
6	No
7	Oh! If that’s the case then...[VAR 0114(0010)]
8	Hmm. Then I don’t know...[VAR 0114(0010)]
9	Fine. Whatever. Let’s get started.[VAR 0114(0010)]

0	You summon the Totem Pokémon and prove\nyour strength to it...\c\nThat’s what every trial boils down to, right?[VAR 0114(0010)]
1	So I thought...\c\nWhy not just call the totem here from\nthe start?[VAR 0114(0010)]
2	So I tried a bit of this and that, and I think I’ve\nwhipped up a little device to call the\r\nTotem Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0010)]
3	Perhaps you’re wondering why I built\na machine?\c\nHere at the observatory, we also monitor\nsounds that we detect from outer space.\c\nThere are some sounds that are inaudible to\npeople but Pokémon can hear just fine.[VAR 0114(0010)]
4	We broadcast the sounds we have gathered\nterrestrially and monitor the reactions\r\nof Pokémon.\c\nThe machine that summons the Totem Pokémon\nmakes use of this technology...[VAR 0114(0010)]
5	Utilizing other sounds we have gathered, we\nalso developed a security system here...\r\nBut that was actually Big Mo’s invention.[VAR 0114(0010)]
6	Just so you know...\c\nThis will actually be my first time trying it out,\nso I’m glad you came. I needed a test subject.[VAR 0114(0010)]
7	Ping Totem Pokémon 2.0, engage![VAR 0114(0010)]
8	Now the totem should—[VAR 0114(0010)]
9	Vwoon!
10	Gyargh?!\nNo way! Did I blow a fuse?![VAR 0114(0010)]
11	Oww! Did the door close?! Let’s see, we’ll need\nto turn off the security system to get the\r\ndoor open...[VAR 0114(0010)]
12	You’ll have to pass an audio quiz! [VAR 0114(0010)]
13	I-it’s fine.\nI definitely feel a powerful presence.\c\nIt’s coming now.\c\nThe Totem Pokémon is coming.[VAR 0114(0010)]
14	So let’s get this trial going, OK?\nMy trial is about to begin![VAR 0114(0010)]
239
0	Vwoon-vwoon-vwoo-vwoon!
1	Soffy![VAR 0114(001C)]
2	Big Mo![VAR 0114(0010)]
3	Nice work, Captain!\c\nYou helped [VAR 0100(0000)] here through h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]iser\ntrial, and your experiment was a success![VAR 0114(001C)]
4	It seems that your Ping Totem Pokémon 2.0\nuses too much electricity.\c\nIf we can get a little assistance from Charjabug,\nwe should be able to make some improvements.[VAR 0114(001C)]
5	Here, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nI’ll give you this Electrium Z to reward you for\nbeating the Totem Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0010)]
6	You watching?[VAR 0114(0010)]
7	I was fine when the power was off. Geez... Now\nthat you can see me, I feel all nervous... I’m not\r\nsure what to say.\c\nThanks? Or, uh, congratulations? You passed\nmy trial.[VAR 0114(0010)]
8	That is all.[VAR 0114(0010)]
9	You really are a fine Trainer, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(001C)]
240
0	Hope you’re ready, [VAR 0100(0000)]. My trial is\nabout to begin!\c\nPing Totem Pokémon 2.0, engage![VAR 0114(0010)]

0	Congratulations on clearing your trial!\c\nAnd you, Sophocles.\nYou did well as captain.[VAR 0114(001C)]
1	I was really nervous...[VAR 0114(0010)]
2	Don’t you worry. I’m sure that I made the right\nchoice in naming you captain.\c\nEven if you are my cousin.[VAR 0114(001C)]
3	Usually it’s the island kahuna who appoints\nthe captains.\c\nBut there are some, er, unusual circumstances\nhere on Ula’ula.[VAR 0114(001C)]
4	So somehow I ended up captain...[VAR 0114(0010)]
5	But you were really great, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0010)]
6	Maybe you should invite h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer to check out\nthe Battle Agency in that case![VAR 0114(001C)]
7	Big Mo! You’re a genius!\nThat’s a marvelous idea![VAR 0114(0010)]
8	[VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nCome with me to one of Festival Plaza’s most\nunique facilities: the Battle Agency![VAR 0114(0010)]
9	You kids have a good time![VAR 0114(001C)]
10	[~ 10]
11	I see...\nThen let me reward you![VAR 0114(001C)]
12	This is one of the Z-Crystals that I collected\nlong ago during my own island challenge to\r\nprove my strength and that of my Pokémon.\c\nSo it seems fitting that it go from me to you.\nTake it, and use it well.[VAR 0114(001C)]
13	And if we’re done here, [VAR 0100(0000)]...\nCould I ask you to do a favor for me?\r\nProfessor Kukui forgot this.[VAR 0114(001C)]
14	He said he would be going back to Malie Garden.\nCould you take it to him?[VAR 0114(001C)]
15	Maybe next time we can battle...[VAR 0114(0010)]
252
0	Come on! Hurry it up, yo!\nWe’ve gotta get to Malie Garden, quick![VAR 0114(0031)]

1	[~ 1]
2	[~ 2]
3	Well, if you’re done here, [VAR 0100(0000)]...\ncould I ask you to do a favor for me?\r\nMy pal Kukui seems to have forgotten this.[VAR 0114(001C)]
4	He said he’d be going back to Malie Garden,\ndidn’t he?\r\nSorry to ask, but take it to him, would you?[VAR 0114(001C)]
5	Maybe next time we can battle, too...[VAR 0114(0010)]
254
0	Yo, yo, yo!\nHold up, yo, Mr. Kukui![VAR 0114(0031)]
1	You say you wanna make a Pokémon League?\nYou got rocks in your skull?[VAR 0114(0032)]
2	Four turns![VAR 0114(0005)]
3	Huh?[VAR 0114(0031)]
4	Bring it on, the both of you! I’ve been\nresearching Pokémon moves, yeah, so I’m\r\nalways ready, oh yeah!\c\nI’ll take you both on in a Battle Royal, and you’ll\nbe down with just a Swift and Incinerate or two!\c\nYou gotta beat the man to be the man, boys![VAR 0114(0005)]
5	Yo, for real?[VAR 0114(0031)]
6	F-fine! You asked for it![VAR 0114(0032)]
7	Get ’em good, Professor!
8	You numskulls should learn your place!
9	Battle Royal, huh? Nice idea there, Kukui.\nYou can beat down three Pokémon at\r\nonce, huh?[VAR 0114(0030)]
10	It’s Guzma...
11	The boss has graced us with his presence![VAR 0114(0031)]

1	Greetings, cowering public![VAR 0114(0017)]
2	We have an exciting bout for you tonight! In the\nopposing corner, the Pokémon professor Kukui!\r\nAnd in this corner, the boss of Team Skull and\r\nthe hardest guy around, Guzma![VAR 0114(0017)]
256
0	Here we are, Kukui...\c\nFellow rejects who never could\nbecome captains.[VAR 0114(0017)]
1	We’ve got all these moldy old\ntraditions in Alola—the kahunas, the captains...\c\nIt’s about time we cut out all that silly garbage\nand make something new for ourselves.\r\nTrust me, I get that.[VAR 0114(0017)]
2	Don’t get me wrong, though, Kukui.\nWe’ve got no need for a Pokémon League.\c\nAfter all, everyone already knows who the\nstrongest Trainer is on these islands![VAR 0114(0017)]
3	Speak for yourself, Guzma.\c\nIt’s not like I couldn’t become a captain.\nI chose not to. I had other dreams, see?[VAR 0114(0005)]
4	I wanted to figure out which moves would\nbe strong enough to beat old Hala...\r\nand I finally found what I was looking for.\c\nThe strongest moves you can use are the ones\na Trainer and their Pokémon choose together...\r\nin the heat of the moment, when it really counts.[VAR 0114(0005)]
5	That’s when I knew I had to make a Pokémon\nLeague, yeah, to give everybody a chance to be\r\npushed to the limit with their team and find that\r\nperfect move!\c\nLet’s see it, Guzma! Show me your moves and\nprove you aren’t just all talk!\c\nIf you really can, that is...[VAR 0114(0005)]
6	Right, [VAR 0100(0000)]?\nDon’t you agree?[VAR 0114(0005)]
7	That’s right
8	What?
9	So you’re one of the kids on h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]iser island\nchallenge? You don’t look like you’re from\r\naround here![VAR 0114(0017)]
10	This here’s [VAR 0100(0000)].\n[VAR 1100(00FF,0201)]HShe just moved to Alola recently.\c\nDiscovery! New experiences! Adventure!\n[VAR 1100(00FF,0201)]HShe’s loving every minute of it![VAR 0114(0005)]
11	[VAR 0100(0000)] and h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]iser [VAR 0101(0001)] can\nunleash some real powerful moves.\c\nSo if you think you’re the strongest Trainer on\nthese islands, Guzma, why don’t you battle h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer?[VAR 0114(0005)]
12	Tch! This move fanatic is getting me all riled up![VAR 0114(0017)]
13	You’ve got a Z-Power Ring, huh, kid?[VAR 0114(0017)]
14	Why even bother with the island challenge?\nWhat’s the point of it?[VAR 0114(0017)]
15	It’ll make me strong
16	That’s what I want to find out
17	No it won’t, you dumb kid!\c\nWatch closely, Kukui.\c\nSomeday I’m gonna destroy you.\nBut first, I’ll destroy everything you care about![VAR 0114(0017)]
18	Ha! You don’t even know why you’re doing it.\c\nWatch closely, Kukui.\c\nSomeday I’m gonna destroy you.\nBut first, I’ll destroy everything you care about![VAR 0114(0017)]
19	Wanna see what destruction looks like?\nHere it is in human form—it’s your boy Guzma![VAR 0114(0017)]
20	Guzma!!!\nWhat is wrong with you?!\c\nNow’s the time for your vaunted team to let\nloose and destroy everything![VAR 0114(0017)]
21	It was [VAR 0100(0000)], right?\c\nI’ll remember you...as someone I’ll be happy\nto beat down anytime![VAR 0114(0017)]
22	Don’t mess with the boss, yo!\nYou don’t want him to get serious![VAR 0114(0031)]
23	So you’re Hau, huh?[VAR 0114(0017)]
24	And you’re Guzma...? So?[VAR 0114(0007)]
25	Y’know you don’t have to do this island\nchallenge thing just because your granddad’s\r\na kahuna.\c\nEven if you finish, you might not get what\nyou want.[VAR 0114(0017)]
26	Team Skull will have to go lick their wounds now!\nGetting beat by a child just doing h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]iser trials!
27	Aue, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nYou are one righteous Trainer!
257
0	Woo, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
1	Those were some nice moves!\nI can feel my soul shaking![VAR 0114(0005)]
2	Oh yeah! I almost forgot to give you something\nsuper important!\c\nHere you go, cousin. This is the Z-Crystal for\n[VAR 0101(0002)]...\r\nThe Evolution of the [VAR 0101(0001)]\r\nyou chose![VAR 0114(0005)]
3	And, uh, about that mask you’ve got there,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]...\c\nMolayne gave you that, yeah?\c\nI’ll take it, if you don’t mind. I can make sure it\ngets back to the Masked Royal safe and sound...[VAR 0114(0005)]
4	You handed the mask to the professor!
5	You saw that, too, yeah, Hau?[VAR 0114(0005)]
6	Uh, yeah, I did!\c\nThat was an awesome battle, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0007)]
7	Maybe someday Guzma’ll figure out what\nit is you kids learn on the island challenge.[VAR 0114(0005)]
8	So what happened to Lillie?\nYou guys lose her somewhere?[VAR 0114(0005)]
9	I’m right here.[VAR 0114(0006)]
10	And so is Acerola![VAR 0114(0011)]
11	[~ 11]
12	You and the professor fought those horrible\nTeam Skull thugs, [VAR 0100(0000)]?\r\nJust thinking about it makes me worry...\r\nThey sound like a scary group...[VAR 0114(0006)]
13	You think? I don’t know. Exchanging a few\nmoves in battle is the quickest way to get to\r\nknow someone in my book.[VAR 0114(0005)]
14	Well, I’m going to head up Mount Lanakila.\c\nI’ve gotta make sure the Pokémon League gets\nfinished and everybody has the chance to find\r\ntheir own perfect move!\c\nKeep training hard on your island challenge.\nOne day the two of you’ll make it there, too![VAR 0114(0005)]
15	[VAR 0100(0000)], Hau...\nbe sure you’re not pushing yourself too hard.[VAR 0114(0006)]
16	[VAR 0100(0000)]!\nYou made it through Sophocles’s trial, huh?\c\nThat’s really great!\nYou can take on the next trial up past Route 11.\r\nThrough Tapu Village, you know?\c\nIf you get lost on your way, ask a police officer\nfor directions. They’re here to serve, right?[VAR 0114(0011)]
17	Now, Lillie, you’re coming with me to do\nsome shopping![VAR 0114(0011)]
18	You remember what my gramps told us?\c\nHe said we’d meet Pokémon and people on our\njourney that’d enrich our lives, yeah?\c\nI mean...I’m having a good time on my journey,\nfor sure, but...maybe that’s not enough?[VAR 0114(0007)]

0	Greetings, trial-goer.\c\nLet me check your collection of Z-Crystals.
1	It looks like you haven’t yet earned your\nElectrium Z, have you?\c\nTake the bus that leaves from Route 10, and\ncomplete the trial that awaits you at the\r\nHokulani Observatory!
2	Ho! Look at that blinding yellow Electrium Z!
3	Now I guess I’ll have to open the gate for you!
4	What you face up ahead is the Ghost-type trial.\nI hope you enjoy it!
5	Haina Desert...\nIt’s a pretty fun place, don’t you think?
6	I wonder what Tapu Bulu is thinking, off there\nin Haina Desert...\c\nWhat about Nanu could have made it think that\nhe of all people would make a good kahuna?
259
0	Greetings, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(000B)]
1	Well met!\nI was seeking you.\c\nIf you’re going to travel about Ula’ula, you\nought to do it while astride a Mudsdale.\c\nThere is no call for hesitation.\nConsider it my thanks for Akala Island.[VAR 0114(000B)]
2	Mudsdale was registered to your Ride Pager!
3	It was remiss of me not to register her\nfor you when we met one another in Malie.\c\nI was just so taken aback by Lillie and how\nlovely she was that it escaped me.\c\nBy no means was I just waiting for a time when\nyou were in trouble![VAR 0114(000B)]
4	Ni-hiii!
5	Let me pose a question...\nDo you know of the Ultra Recon Squad?[VAR 0114(000B)]
6	I keep running into them
7	I’m sort of helping them
8	They seem to be here to investigate some ill\nthat weighs heavily upon them.\c\nLuckily, it is quite in keeping with the people\nand Pokémon of Alola to help those in need.[VAR 0114(000B)]
9	If you seek the next trial, go straight\non through here to Tapu Village.\c\nI’ll be cheering for you on your island challenge![VAR 0114(000B)]
260
0	[VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0007)]
1	Phew, that Togedemaru was strong!\nBut I managed to get through the trial, too.\r\nMaybe even managed to get a bit stronger, eh?[VAR 0114(0007)]
2	I heard from Sophocles how you just breezed\nthrough that trial yourself, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nYou’re something else!\nI know! You should take this![VAR 0114(0007)]
3	You only have one volume, don’t you?\c\nHaven’t you ever heard the expression that\nsilence is golden?[VAR 0114(0013)]
4	Gah! He’s back![VAR 0114(0007)]
5	Listen, Team Skull is looking for a Pokémon\ncalled Cosmog...\c\nDo you two know anything?[VAR 0114(0013)]
6	What?!\c\nN-not that we’d tell you![VAR 0114(0007)]
7	So you do know something.\c\nLook...\nCosmog isn’t even a strong Pokémon.\c\nBut it has the potential to summon Pokémon\nso terrifyingly strong that you don’t even know.\c\nIf something like that happened, it would be\na disaster for Alola...[VAR 0114(0013)]
8	A disaster? Like...a real disaster?\nThen what’re we supposed to do about it?[VAR 0114(0007)]
9	Protect it! If you do know where Cosmog is\nor if you do find anything out...just keep it safe!\c\nI know I might be working for Team Skull right\nnow, so you may not trust me or care but...\r\nI’m going to tell you this just once.\c\nYou have to protect Cosmog...\nno matter what![VAR 0114(0013)]
10	I still don’t even understand how Team Skull\nfound out about Cosmog in the first place...[VAR 0114(0013)]
11	What do you mean? No matter what?\nYou just gonna leave us hanging?![VAR 0114(0007)]
12	[VAR 0100(0000)]...\c\nIf they’re really looking for Cosmog, then...\nIs Lillie gonna be OK?[VAR 0114(0007)]
13	I don’t really get what’s going on, but we’ve\njust got to keep both of them safe, right?!\c\nThen I know what I’m gonna do.\nTake on the next trials to train with my partner![VAR 0114(0007)]
14	Look, I know Guzma was saying all those things,\nbut I really wanna complete my island challenge\r\nand help people learn about Pokémon battling!\c\nAnd, I dunno, I’ve gotta make sure I really get\nwhat my partner’s feeling, too![VAR 0114(0007)]
261
0	Greetings, trial-goer!\nI’m afraid this is a captain’s barricade.\c\nOnly those who pass the Ghost-type trial\ncan come through here.
1	Ho! That’s Ghostium Z right there!\c\nThen let me just get this thing out of the way\nfor you! One second...
2	Beyond this gate stretches the great expanse\nof Haina Desert.\r\nIt’s a bit different every day, due to the wind...\r\nOr maybe it’s the snorting breath of Tapu Bulu!
3	Oh, hey! Um, if you’ve got one to spare...\nthink you could front me a Fresh Water?
4	Oh! Thanks, friend!\nHere, let me give you these in return.\c\nThey’re Adrenaline Orbs.\c\nDon’t you feel like the Pokémon that other\nPokémon call to help them in battle are, like,\r\nstronger? And even more likely to be Shiny?
5	My partner is a Poliwhirl with the Water Absorb\nAbility, so it loves a little dousing now and then.
6	Well, thanks for wanting to help!\nBut it looks like you don’t have a Fresh Water.\c\nIf you remember me, hopefully you can bring me\none next time you’re passing through here!
7	I get it! Your Fresh Waters are precious to you.\c\nBut if you remember me, maybe you can bring\nan extra for me next time!
8	Po...

0	Phew... Look, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nSeems like we’re almost to the Aether House,\nwhere the captain is supposed to be, huh?[VAR 0114(0007)]
1	So that way lies Mount Lanakila, huh?\c\nI guess they’re really making a Pokémon League\nup there on the peak...[VAR 0114(0007)]
2	The professor told me that Pokémon Leagues\nin other regions have four crazy-strong Trainers\r\nin them that they call the Elite Four![VAR 0114(0007)]
3	The Elite Four and our island kahunas...\nI wonder which ones are stronger!\r\nI’m pretty sure my gramps is the strongest, but\r\nI can’t wait to find out for sure![VAR 0114(0007)]
264
0	Hey! Alola![VAR 0114(0007)]
1	An Alola to you![VAR 0114(0037)]
2	So this is Tapu Village!\nWe will need to investigate it quite thoroughly.\c\nAccording to the records we have left to us,\nit seems that this is where Necrozma battled\r\nagainst the tapu when it came to Alola long ago,\r\nhungering for its light.[VAR 0114(0036)]
3	It may be the case that the power which came\npouring out of the Ultra Wormhole at that time\r\nis what changes Pokémon’s regular moves into\r\nZ-Moves. Such theories have been suggested...[VAR 0114(0036)]
4	Our ancestors were greedy, and they sought to\ncontrol all of Necrozma’s light...\c\nBut what was the result of all that?\nThey only hurt Necrozma, making it lose a part\r\nof itself and causing it to run wild and steal all\r\nthe light it could find![VAR 0114(0036)]
5	That’s why we have Necrozma cooped up in\nthe Megalo Tower our great ancestors built.\r\nIt contains Necrozma in its rage.[VAR 0114(0037)]
6	But that facility has reached its limit...\c\nAnd Necrozma hungers for light...\c\nThat is why we came to Alola in hopes of finding\na new method to defeat Necrozma. Yet...[VAR 0114(0036)]
7	It seems it will be a difficult mission for us, who\nare so new to Pokémon battling, to ever hope to\r\ndefeat Necrozma.[VAR 0114(0036)]
8	An alola to you, [VAR 0100(0000)] and Hau.[VAR 0114(0038)]
9	So, this is Tapu Village...\nWe must learn all we can about this place.\c\nIt seems there are many stories in its past, but\nonce, long ago, the Blinding One battled against\r\nthe tapu in this spot.[VAR 0114(0039)]
10	It’s thought the power that came pouring\nout of the Ultra Wormhole at that time may be\r\nthe source of Z-Moves’ power...\c\nYes, the light that the Blinding One...\c\nI mean, the light that Necrozma can wield.[VAR 0114(0038)]
11	Our ancestors were greedy, though.\c\nThey sought to control all of Necrozma’s light...\c\nThey hurt Necrozma...\c\nThey left it incomplete, and in such a state,\nit went mad with fury...\c\nAnd so our light was stolen by Necrozma.[VAR 0114(0039)]
12	Our world is at peace now thanks to the Megalo\nTower, which keeps the Blinding One contained.\r\nBut we believe the tower is reaching its limit.\c\nAnd the Blinding One...\nNecrozma hungers for light. [VAR 0114(0038)]
13	The Blinding One may run wild in its fury, but it\ndid also give us light once.\c\nSo we would like to help restore the Blinding\nOne to its true form.\c\nBut we do not have even the slightest idea\nof how we can do that.[VAR 0114(0039)]
14	If you learn anything that you think might help,\nwill you share it with us?\c\nAfter all, you are far more familiar with the\nZ-Moves than we are.[VAR 0114(0039)]
15	I don’t really get what all that was about...\c\nBut it seems like those Ultra Recon Squad\npeople are in a pretty hopeless spot, huh?[VAR 0114(0007)]
16	I just wish everybody could be happy and find\nsomething to smile about. Even that Necrozma.\r\nRight, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0007)]
265
0	Wait up, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nSo, this is the Aether House, eh?[VAR 0114(0007)]
1	Strangers!
2	This means battle!
3	What? Why?![VAR 0114(0007)]
4	We’ll protect our home when Acerola’s away!
5	I tried really hard! I am a kid, you know!
6	Phew... So I won, yeah?\nThen why’s this little fellow still gnawing on me?[VAR 0114(0007)]
7	Grrrssssss!
8	I’m ba-a-ack, everybody![VAR 0114(0011)]
9	Ha ha ha! Looks like I finished up my shopping\nspree right on time!\c\nYou’ve already met everyone?[VAR 0114(0011)]
10	Oh yeah, we met all right...\nIn battle anyway.\c\nBut...\nHey, where’s Lillie?[VAR 0114(0007)]
11	I left her with Hapu.\nThey should be coming soon.[VAR 0114(0011)]
12	So why don’t we get those trials done first?\nYou did know I’m the captain, right?[VAR 0114(0011)]
13	These ankle biters are starting to grow on me.\c\nI think I might hang out for a while.\nIt’s kinda soothing, you know?[VAR 0114(0007)]
14	My trial takes place at the abandoned site\nwhere the supermarket used to be.\c\nWhen you want to go, I’ll meet you out front of\nAether House to show you the way![VAR 0114(0011)]
15	Everybody lives together with Pokémon here at\nAether House.
16	The Aether Fun-day-shun pays for everything!

1	For real, girl?!\c\nYour bag was moving! Right in front of my eyes!\nAnd I’m just supposed to ignore that?!
2	If you’ve got some rare Pokémon in there, I’m\ngonna have to take it and make some cash!\c\nEven if it’s not that rare of a Pokémon, I bet\nI could still get paid, yo.
3	[VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0006)]
4	Oh, so we’re following that script, are we?\nA Trainer dashes forward to save the girl, huh?\r\nI’m not gonna let you be the hero in this scene!
5	When I saw that adorable Drowzee, that was\nenough for me! Later!
6	[~ 6]
7	Phew...\nThank you, [VAR 0100(0000)]...[VAR 0114(0006)]
8	I just wanted to go for a stroll on my own,\nto see what it must feel like to be a Trainer...\r\nSo Hapu and I went our separate ways...\r\nbut then Nebby tried to get out of my bag...[VAR 0114(0006)]
9	Didn’t you! Go on, you little troublemaker...\nYou’d better thank [VAR 0100(0000)], too![VAR 0114(0006)]
10	Pew!
11	Oh, and...um.\c\nWhen I was out shopping, I kept thinking about\nhow I wanted to be some help to you during\r\nyour island challenge...and then I saw these.[VAR 0114(0006)]
12	I bought them without even thinking![VAR 0114(0006)]
267
0	Oh! Lillie![VAR 0114(0011)]
1	What’s the matter? You look all worn out.\nDo you want to rest at Aether House awhile?[VAR 0114(0011)]
2	Oh, Acerola... \nThank you! I think I might take you up on that.[VAR 0114(0006)]
3	And you, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nWe can reach my trial site from Tapu Village.\c\nCome on, follow me![VAR 0114(0011)]
4	[VAR 0100(0000)]!\nDo your best to become a real champion![VAR 0114(0006)]
5	The old supermarket where I hold my trial is\nright down this way. Down Route 14![VAR 0114(0011)]
6	Here we are!\nClimb up these steps and my trial begins![VAR 0114(0011)]
268
0	The time has finally come, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0011)]
1	So, I guess I should explain what kind of trial\nthis is, huh?[VAR 0114(0011)]
2	This old building is full of lots of Ghost-type\nPokémon. Did you know?\c\nHere’s where the trial part comes in.\c\nYou’ve got to find the Totem Pokémon of this\nsite and snap a shot of it with a Poké Finder![VAR 0114(0011)]
3	The totem is a bit of a trickster, and it likes to\nplay hide-and-seek and mess around.\c\nIf you take pictures of the other Ghost-type\nPokémon inside, it’ll definitely come out to get\r\nin on the fun and have its photo taken, too![VAR 0114(0011)]
4	So, if you see something weird happening inside\nthis old place, try to check it out.\c\nI bet you’ll find a Ghost-type Pokémon causing\nthe mischief, so get its photo before it’s gone![VAR 0114(0011)]
5	I’ll just borrow your Poké Finder for a sec.\c\nHee hee!\nAnd your Rotom is a Ghost type, too![VAR 0114(0011)]
6	We just do this, and...[VAR 0114(0011)]
7	There! I’ve set it up to use a special shooting\nmode just for this trial.\c\nYou’ll only be able to use it at this site, though.[VAR 0114(0011)]
8	As soon as you enter the building, your trial\nwill begin. Got it?\c\nAnd you can’t catch any of the Pokémon, either.\c\nAnd you can’t leave without giving up, too, so\nmake sure you’re ready for anything![VAR 0114(0011)]
9	As soon as you enter the building, your trial\nwill begin. Got it?\c\nAnd you can’t catch any of the Pokémon, either.\c\nAlso, you can’t leave without giving up, so make\nsure you’re ready for anything![VAR 0114(0011)]

2	A shopping cart started moving all on its own!
3	The shopping cart is moving all on its own!\c\nDo you want to fire up the Poké Finder?
4	Those dolls are moving all by themselves!
5	The dolls are moving all by themselves!\c\nDo you want to fire up the Poké Finder?
6	You can hear Acerola from the outside!
7	You want to give up on my trial?[VAR 0114(0011)]
8	Got it!\c\nThen make sure you’re ready and try again![VAR 0114(0011)]
9	You want to give up on my trial?[VAR 0114(0011)]
10	The door is locked!
11	You didn’t do a thing, but the lock clicked open!
12	Got it! Then do your best![VAR 0114(0011)]
13	Nothing seems to be wrong with the conveyor\nbelt now...[VAR 0114(0011)]
14	Nothing seems to be wrong with the shopping\ncart now...
15	Nothing seems to be wrong with the display of\ndolls now...
16	Oh no! The Pokémon spotted you!
17	Let’zzz see here...\c\nLookzzz like you’re supposed to try to find a\nPokémon and snap a shot of ’em with that\r\nPoké Finder, right? Zz-zz-zzt![VAR 0114(0035)]
18	Catching the right shot can be tough, huh?\c\nTry to catch a shot of your subject zzzoomed\nin and right in the center of the viewfinder![VAR 0114(0035)]
19	Looks like some of the Pokémon in thizzz place\nlike to play hide-and-seek, zzz-zzt!\c\nTry to catch sight of ’em with your Poké Finder,\nthen snap a shot when you’ve got them all\r\nzzzoomed in and centered in the frame![VAR 0114(0035)]
20	...Who are you?
21	Acerola?
22	I’m [VAR 0100(0000)]?
23	Oh... Never mind that.
24	Looks like you’re done with the trial, right?\nWe should hurry up and leave this place.
25	I’m not done yet
26	I’m leaving now!
27	This place is dangerous.\nYou should give up on your trial and get out.
28	I’m not done yet
29	I told you to get out.
30	I’m not leaving
31	Get out.
32	No!
33	Get out. Get out! Get OUT!\nGET OUT! GET OUT! GET OUT!!!
34	Take a photo
35	Hehehe... Good.\nThen everything is just fine.

2	Mimikyu disappeared somewhere...
3	A picture was added to your Poké Finder!\c\nThere is a fuzzy image of Mimikyu caught in\nthe picture!
4	I’m picking up signzzz of some kinda life-form\nfrom behind us, kiddo![VAR 0114(0035)]
271
0	Welcome back, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nI can check your pictures right away.\c\nNow let’s see how you did...[VAR 0114(0011)]
1	Yup! That’s Mimikyu all right!\c\nIt’s pretty hard to catch it on film, so this is a\nreally great attempt!\c\nWhich means...[VAR 0114(0011)]
2	You received a Z-Crystal from Acerola!
3	You obtained a Ghost-type Z-Crystal!\nThe Ghostium Z is yours!
4	If you want to use Ghost-type Z-Power, then \nyou’ve got to move like this![VAR 0114(0011)]
5	And since you passed my trial, [VAR 0100(0000)],\nyou now have my permission to catch Pokémon\r\nin the trial site. So, in that old building there.\c\nHere you go![VAR 0114(0011)]
6	It’s not a bad idea to have some Ghost-type\nPokémon on your team![VAR 0114(0011)]
7	What’s that?\c\nYou say I was in there and then you went in the\nback room?\c\nOooh, cut it out, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nYou’re trying to scare me, huh?\c\nYou’ll have to come up with something a bit\nmore believable than that!\c\nI was here the whole time, and there’s not even\na room in the back of that shop, for starters!\r\nHow gullible do you think I am?[VAR 0114(0011)]
8	Brrr!\nI feel like I’m getting chicken skin...\c\nLike a chill going through me for some reason...[VAR 0114(0011)]
272
0	Hey, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nYou gave up last time in the middle of my\ntrial, huh? [VAR 0114(0011)]
1	The Ghost types in that old place are pretty\ntough to take on, huh?\c\nRemember that Ghost types are weak to other\nGhost types and Dark types, too!\c\nI’m sure you’ll make it this time!\nDon’t give up on my trial yet! I believe in you![VAR 0114(0011)]
2	Mimikyu is a pretty tough opponent, isn’t it?\c\nIt’s a Ghost- and Fairy-type Pokémon.\nDid you know?\c\nNeither type has a lot of weaknesses,\nso it’s tricky to beat.\c\nYou probably want to try Ghost- or Steel-type\nmoves against it.\c\nI’m sure you’ll beat it this time!\nDon’t give up on my trial yet!

0	You can hear Acerola’s voice outside...
1	So, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nYou gave up on my trial last time, huh?[VAR 0114(0011)]
2	The Ghost types in that old place are pretty\ntough to take on, huh?\c\nRemember that Ghost types are weak to other\nGhost types and Dark types, too!\c\nI’m sure you’ll make it this time!\nDon’t give up on my trial yet! I believe in you![VAR 0114(0011)]
3	Mimikyu is a pretty tough opponent, isn’t it?\c\nIt’s a Ghost- and Fairy-type Pokémon.\nDid you know?\c\nNeither type has a lot of weaknesses,\nso it’s tricky to beat.\c\nYou probably want to try Ghost- or Steel-type\nmoves against it.\c\nI’m sure you’ll beat it this time!\nDon’t give up on my trial yet! I believe in you![VAR 0114(0011)]

0	That supermarket...\nIt was destroyed by our guardian deity.\r\nYup, that was Tapu Bulu all right.[VAR 0114(0011)]
1	This area used to be real important to people,\nbut some folks only thought of making money,\r\nso they went and built a store here...\c\nTapu Bulu may be all about growing things, but\nthis place isn’t what it wants to see growing.[VAR 0114(0011)]
2	Come on...\nLet’s go back to Aether House!\r\n[VAR 0100(0000)] must be waiting for us![VAR 0114(0011)]
275
0	Back so soon, hmm? I wasn’t expecting you\njust yet.[VAR 0114(0018)]
1	It takes these dumb Grunts way too long to deal\nwith you kids...[VAR 0114(0018)]
2	So I guess it’s my turn now![VAR 0114(0018)]
3	What? I told you before.\c\nNext time you get in our way, I’m not holding\nanything back![VAR 0114(0018)]
4	Hmmph. Guess you are pretty tough.\c\nNow I understand why my Grunts waste so\nmuch time battling kids.[VAR 0114(0018)]
5	But if you want us to return the Pokémon, then\nyou’ll have to come to us.\c\nAlone.\c\nThe boss is dying to meet you, hmmph!\c\nSee you at our base in Po Town![VAR 0114(0018)]
6	Sorry...\nThere were too many of them for me to stop...[VAR 0114(0007)]
7	Ugh...\nBattles you can’t afford to lose aren’t any fun...[VAR 0114(0007)]
8	This him? The kahuna’s grandson?\nNo wonder he put up a decent fight!
9	What’s going on here?!\nSeriously, what is going on?![VAR 0114(0011)]
10	Hey! Are you guys OK?![VAR 0114(0011)]
276
0	M-my Yungoos...
1	We can’t forgive this![VAR 0114(0011)]
2	Darn it, those numskulls actually did something\npretty clever for once![VAR 0114(0011)]
3	If we want to get the Pokémon back...\c\nthen [VAR 0100(0000)] has to go to Po Town...\nAll alone? With no backup?\c\nThat’s what they said, but...that’s not fair![VAR 0114(0007)]
4	Team Skull has taken over Po Town...\nIt’s basically their private playground now.\c\nOh! I know!\c\nIf you’re gonna go, though, try to find this guy\non Route 15 who’s wearing a kimono...\r\nHe might be able to help you get to Po Town.\c\nHe knows a whole lot about Pokémon that can\ntravel across the water. [VAR 0114(0011)]
5	H-here. Take this...\nJust...just get my Yungoos back for me!
6	I feel so alone and scared without my Pokémon...\nI can’t sleep at night without her...
7	You’re gonna help us, aren’t you?\nYou’re strong, right?
8	You’re gonna help us, aren’t you?\nYou’re strong, right?
9	I-I’m sorry, [VAR 0100(0000)]. It’s my fault...\c\nNow you’ve got to put yourself in danger\nbecause...I couldn’t stop them...[VAR 0114(0007)]
10	Pokémon being abducted like that...\nMaybe even hurt...\r\nI just can’t stand the idea!\c\n[VAR 0100(0000)]!\nPlease...help them![VAR 0114(0006)]
11	Pew...
277
0	A trial-goer, huh?\c\nAnd why would you be coming to a lonely odd\nplace like this?[VAR 0114(0030)]
1	I’ve gotta get Team Skull
2	I need a Ride Pokémon
3	Uh-huh...\nI see you’ve got your reasons.[VAR 0114(0030)]
4	Then...I’ll take you on.\c\nTell me. Uncle Grimsley is going to flip a coin.\nWill it be heads or tails?[VAR 0114(0028)]
5	Heads
6	Tails
7	Neither
8	...Astonishing.\nYou just took a stab, like some kind of prophet.\c\nRight now, you and your Pokémon are shining\nbrilliantly.[VAR 0114(0028)]
9	...Astonishing.\c\nI had indeed been planning to have Skarmory\nsnatch it out of the air as it spun in the sky.[VAR 0114(0028)]
10	A loss is a loss.\c\nI’ll give you Sharpedo’s info for your Ride Pager\nthen. Ride it to victory.[VAR 0114(0028)]
11	Sharpedo was registered to your Ride Pager![VAR 0114(0028)]
12	Maybe you don’t need to hear this from me,\nbut I’m going to tell you anyway.\c\nIf you press  while riding on Sharpedo there,\nit’ll [VAR FF00(0001)]jet[VAR FF00(0000)] forward and smash through rocks\r\nlike those ones there.[VAR 0114(0028)]
13	And here’s a bit more unwanted advice.\c\nPo Town lies at the other end of Route 16 here.\nBut it’s thoroughly occupied by Team Skull.\c\nYou shouldn’t go there unless you want trouble.[VAR 0114(0028)]
14	If somebody wins a battle, then without doubt,\nsomeone else has lost the battle.\c\nThat’s the way of battle.\nI hope I might battle you someday.[VAR 0114(0028)]
15	Sometimes you have to lay everything on the\nline in life, and risk it all...\c\nWhen I did that, though, I’m afraid I lost.\nI took to walking along the shore in my despair.\c\nAnd before I even noticed what I was doing,\nI ended up riding Alola’s waves together with\r\nSharpedo and Mantine...\c\nThat’s right... The role I’m meant to play now\nis to teach others what it means to ride...[VAR 0114(0028)]
16	Champion, huh...\nThat’s a title I haven’t heard in a while.\c\nAllow me to offer my congratulations as a former\nmember of the Unova region’s own Elite Four...\r\nwhen we meet at Poni Island’s Battle Tree![VAR 0114(0028)]
278
0	Oh my. If it isn’t [VAR 0100(0000)].\nWhere might you be off to?[VAR 0114(0015)]
1	To see Team Skull
2	To Po Town
3	To see Team Skull?!\nYou mean you’re going to their base in Po Town?[VAR 0114(0015)]
4	To Po Town?!\nI-isn’t that where Team Skull makes its base?[VAR 0114(0015)]
5	Such awful thugs they are, tormenting poor\nPokémon for no good reason...\r\nI swear I just don’t know what to do with them![VAR 0114(0015)]
6	And just look at me, would you?\c\nHere I am, taking the initiative to travel Alola on\nmy own to check on how Pokémon are doing.\c\nI’ve been trying to think through this Necrozma\nissue on my own. That sort of noble dedication\r\nis what you would expect of a president, even...\r\nDon’t you agree?[VAR 0114(0015)]
7	Not that a foolish child could...\c\nAhem.\nI mean, not that I would expect you to know.\c\nAnyhow. Do try to stay safe.\nDon’t say I didn’t warn you about Team Skull.[VAR 0114(0015)]

3	You really think you’re ready for that?
4	I am!
5	Maybe?
6	Run back home, kid.
7	I guess everyone has their own reasons.\c\nI’ve got my reasons, too, for doing what I do.\c\nI’ll have them let you in.

6	Later days, Team Skull...\nFarewell, my misspent youth...
7	Hey, yo, barricade or no,\nwe ain’t lettin’ you go![VAR 0114(0032)]
8	We needed that barricade after all! Come on,\nhold back a little![VAR 0114(0032)]
9	We’re gonna get strong enough for anything,\neven if we don’t have that old barricade!
10	I’m not the bad one here.\c\nThe real bad ones are whatever fools decided\nthat I’m bad!
11	I can never make Pokémon give it their all in\nbattles. I guess it’s my bad...
12	I’ve been thinking of how I can get my Pokémon\nto really bring out their power...\c\nIt’s not like I wanna work my fingers to the bone\ntrying to get strong, though.
13	Yo! If you wanna pass through here, then how\nabout you hand over $10,000,000?\c\nIf I had that much, I wouldn’t have to do\nanything anymore!\c\nWhat’s that? You don’t have it?\nThen I’ll take whatever you do have!
14	Ahhhh! I’ve lost it!\nAhhh! The battle and my motivation!
15	Ever since Team Skull broke up, I’ve been\nkeeping busy not doing anything.\r\nWhat a charmed life I live!

5	How disappointing.[VAR 0114(0014)]
6	I don’t need your approval, Mother!\nOr your permission! I will save Cosmog![VAR 0114(0006)]
7	My...\nYou do say such incomprehensible things.[VAR 0114(0014)]
8	Calling me mother?\nI don’t have any children!\c\nCertainly not any wretched children who would\nrun off and reject my love![VAR 0114(0014)]
9	So tell me how you’ll save that Pokémon.\nWhat can you do, Lillie?\c\nYou failed to convince me to listen to you.\nYou don’t even have the strength of a Trainer.\c\nThe only thing that you’ve ever done on your\nown is steal someone else’s research material![VAR 0114(0014)]
10	It’s so terribly unattractive.\c\nBut know that my fathomless love will save\neven someone like you...\r\nwhen I protect this entire world from darkness![VAR 0114(0014)]
11	Protect this world...?\nMother! What is it you’re trying to do?![VAR 0114(0006)]
12	Is that why you want Nebby?\nIs that what you would sacrifice Cosmog for?[VAR 0114(0006)]
13	That’s right... I will force Cosmog to use its\npower, and it may very well die.\c\nBut if it will save the world for all of my beloved\nPokémon, then that is what I will do.[VAR 0114(0014)]
14	Lillie.\c\nI will be using the Cosmog you stole for a\ngreat purpose.\c\nYou have kept it safe until now, and for that...\nI thank you.[VAR 0114(0014)]

22	We borrowed such a brute’s power ourselves to\ncome here to Alola.[VAR 0114(0038)]
23	But to think that those two hope to capture\nNecrozma on their own...\c\nDo the people of this world truly have so much\nconfidence in their strength in Pokémon battle?[VAR 0114(0039)]
24	If Necrozma awakens...it will hunger for light.\nAnd it will descend upon Alola to take it.[VAR 0114(0038)]

9	We seafolk have spent years navigating the\nseas and searching out new wonders.\c\nWhen we find rare things, we bring ’em here\nto Alola to trade.
10	The ports on the other islands are busier\nthese days, but we still always seem to end\r\nup back here on Poni, eh?
11	What did you all come here for?\nYou collecting Berries, like us?
12	Oh! No, that’s not why we’re here![VAR 0114(0006)]
13	I mean, you’re not entirely wrong.\nIt’s true that [VAR 0100(0000)] is in the middle\r\nof h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]iser island challenge, but...[VAR 0114(0006)]
14	we’re here to meet the kahuna of this island![VAR 0114(0006)]
15	The kahuna?\c\nOh... Well, that’s a problem.\nMaybe you should talk to Hapu?[VAR 0114(0012)]
16	Hmm... Lillie seems like the type that’s hard to\nreally capture in a drawing, know what I mean?[VAR 0114(0012)]
17	The kahuna? Hmm.\c\nMaybe you should go to little Hapu’s place?\c\nHer house is the only one still standing on Poni,\nafter all. Where else would you go, eh?
18	You can recognize little Hapu’s house at a\nglance...thanks to that huge Mudsdale of hers.
19	Oh! So Hapu lives here on Poni Island?\c\nThank you very much, Captain Mina![VAR 0114(0006)]
20	Let’s go, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nIt will be good to see Hapu and Mudsdale again![VAR 0114(0006)]
21	M-modeling, is it?\c\nDoes that mean I’m not allowed to move even an\ninch until you return from Exeggutor Island?\r\nI hope you’ll hurry back, [VAR 0100(0000)]...[VAR 0114(0006)]
22	Lipper!
328
0	I’ll do my best to keep up, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0006)]
1	I’ll be fine! I’ve got Max Repels with me.\c\nAnd I’ve got you, too...[VAR 0114(0006)]
2	Poni Island...\nIt’s a completely different kind of island, isn’t it?[VAR 0114(0006)]
329
0	Ni-hiiii!
1	It’s good to see you again, too, Mudsdale!\nYou look to be in fine form.[VAR 0114(0006)]
2	Wow...\nPokémon Trainers really do amaze me.\c\nIt seems like a hard path to walk, and even so,\nyou don’t let yourself be held back by the fear\r\nof seeing your Pokémon friends get hurt...\c\nYou just keep striving forward together...[VAR 0114(0006)]
3	Oh! Been a while, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nAnd you brought Lillie along, too?[VAR 0114(000B)]
4	Yes. It’s good to see you, Hapu![VAR 0114(0006)]
5	You look different...like you’re ready to go all out\nin something now.[VAR 0114(000B)]
6	Thank you, Hapu.\nI’ve finally discovered what I need to do.\r\nSo this is my Z-Powered form![VAR 0114(0006)]
7	Ho! Then you do your best, Lillie.[VAR 0114(000B)]
8	No one could call you lily-livered![VAR 0114(000B)]
9	Um, so, Hapu...do you know where we can find\nthe kahuna?[VAR 0114(0006)]
10	The kahuna?\c\nHrmm.\nDon’t have one here on Poni.[VAR 0114(000B)]
11	What?![VAR 0114(0006)]
12	Now what do we do, [VAR 0100(0000)]...?[VAR 0114(0006)]
13	Well, do not be distressed. I wouldn’t say\nthat I know nothing of this.[VAR 0114(000B)]
14	All right. Let us all proceed to the ruins.\nYou stick with me, you two.[VAR 0114(000B)]
15	Ni-hiiii!
330
0	[VAR 0100(0000)]...\nwe just have to keep going, right!\c\nBut then again...you are a Trainer, aren’t you?\nI suppose you always keep moving forward![VAR 0114(0006)]
1	Wait there.[VAR 0114(0030)]
2	Eek![VAR 0114(0006)]
3	I-I’m sorry. I don’t think we’ve been introduced...[VAR 0114(0006)]
4	Ho ho ho!\nI’m Hapu’s old gran.\c\nAre you two friends with my girl?
5	Yes, we are
6	How did you guess?
7	Ho ho ho!\nSo she has friends now!
8	Ho ho ho!\nYou’d tease an old woman, eh?
9	Traveling around the islands...\nmaking new friends...\r\nYou kids are luckier than you know.
10	If you want to head for the Poni Island ruins,\nhow about a bit of help from this old gran?\r\nHere. Hand over your Ride Pager a moment.
11	Machamp was registered to your Ride Pager!
12	[~ 12]
13	You’ll need to move some big obstacles to make\nit down the path that you two hope to travel.
14	I wish you both a brilliant future.
15	My Hapu was heading for the Ruins of Hope,\nwasn’t she? Go after her.\c\nFirst, you’ll come to Poni Breaker Coast.\nYou’ll know it by the soil—it’s black as pitch.\r\nGo through there, and you’ll find the ruins.
16	Thank you very much, ma’am!\nYou have been a great help![VAR 0114(0006)]
17	The Ruins of Hope...\c\nthat is where the guardian of Poni Island will be.\nThat is where Tapu Fini lives.\c\nLet’s go![VAR 0114(0006)]
18	I wonder what kind of kahuna my little Hapu\nwill become.\c\nI hope she won’t worry too much about how her\nold granddad did things and find her own path.
331
0	The Ruins of Hope...[VAR 0114(0006)]
1	What is this place...?\nThe air feels so oppressive...[VAR 0114(0006)]
2	But...but if we go in there...\c\nmaybe Nebby will return to normal![VAR 0114(0006)]
3	The people believe that the guardian deity of\nthese ruins, Tapu Fini, can wash away any\r\nimpurities with its mystic water...[VAR 0114(0006)]
4	That sounds promising
5	You think that’ll work?
6	That’s right it does, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nI’m going to give it my all so that we can return\nNebby back to normal![VAR 0114(0006)]
7	Oh, honestly, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nI’m going to make sure that Nebby gets right\nback to normal, just to show you![VAR 0114(0006)]
8	So just you wait, Nebby!\c\nThis time I’m going to be the one who saves you![VAR 0114(0006)]
9	Come on, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nLet’s go![VAR 0114(0006)]
10	Ni-hiiii!
332
0	If we’re going to break a path, we’ll need to\nmove these huge rocks![VAR 0114(0006)]
1	That’s what Hapu’s grandmother said, isn’t it?[VAR 0114(0006)]
2	...Unghhh![VAR 0114(0006)]
3	I don’t think I can do this...\nI-it’s heavier than words can even express...[VAR 0114(0006)]
4	We’ll have to borrow Machamp’s formidable\nstrength for this task.\c\nI read about it once in a book.\nIf I remember right, it said...\c\n“When getting a ride from a powerful Machamp,\nTrainers can activate Machamp’s [VAR FF00(0001)]Shove[VAR FF00(0000)] by\r\nstanding before a rock and pressing !”\c\nAnd if we find ourselves getting frustrated,\nwe should probably remember to step outside\r\nagain for a bit of perspective.[VAR 0114(0006)]
5	When Hapu spoke of an “odd little thing” from\nthe sky...do you think she meant a beast?\c\nWhat do you think Hapu brought us here for?\c\nSo many of the things that Trainers do are\nstill a mystery to me...[VAR 0114(0006)]
333
0	I’ve read about them, you know...\c\nAlola’s sacred ruins...and the guardian deities\nworshipped within them.\c\nThey go wherever they want, so it’s not easy to\nmeet them...according to the books I’ve read.\c\nBut if they are summoned here at the ruins,\nthey do sometimes appear.[VAR 0114(0006)]
1	The books say that they are, well, capricious.\c\nEncounters with them do not always end as\nyou hope they will.\c\nMaybe that explains why...\c\neven coming here to these ruins hasn’t evoked\nany response from Nebby...[VAR 0114(0006)]
2	Oh! There’s Hapu![VAR 0114(0006)]
334
0	I give my thanks...
1	for your great blessing.
2	As kahuna, I will do my best for the people...
3	and the Pokémon of Alola.
335
0	Oh! So you two were watching?[VAR 0114(000B)]
1	The kahunas are chosen by the Pokémon we\nworship here in Alola—our sacred guardians.\c\nThey are chosen from among the people living\non the island each guardian watches over.\c\nLillie told me that you’re pretty new to our parts,\neh, [VAR 0100(0000)]?\r\nYou came to Alola from far off?\c\nYou must really be something then.\c\nI heard how you were given a Sparkling Stone\nby the tapu, even as a stranger to our shores.[VAR 0114(000B)]
2	My grandfather...\c\nMy grandfather was also chosen for this honor.\nThe honor of being our island’s kahuna.\c\nBut he died suddenly some years back,\nand we were left without a kahuna on Poni.[VAR 0114(000B)]
3	I tried to follow in his footsteps, but I was not\nchosen by the tapu back then.\c\nSo I set out on my own sort of island challenge,\ntraveling Alola and trying to grow stronger.[VAR 0114(000B)]
4	Lillie.\c\nThe kahuna you wished to meet is right here.[VAR 0114(000B)]
5	O-oh! Of course!\c\nThen please, Kahuna Hapu!\nTell me about the Legendary Pokémon![VAR 0114(0006)]
6	So you want to know about Solgaleo, who we\npay tribute to at the Altar of the Sunne?[VAR 0114(000B)]
7	So you want to know about Lunala, who we\npay tribute to at the Altar of the Moone?[VAR 0114(000B)]
8	I must go after my mother!\nShe disappeared off into some far-off world...\c\nAnd a fearsome creature lives in that world.\nA Pokémon called Necrozma...[VAR 0114(0006)]
9	That’s why I want to ask the Legendary\nPokémon for its help...\c\nThe Legendary Pokémon is the only one\nwho can go back and forth between worlds![VAR 0114(0006)]
10	A world where beasts reside, eh...\c\nI reckon that must be the kind of world you find\nat the other end of those holes that open up in\r\nthe sky, just as my grandfather once described.[VAR 0114(000B)]
11	All right.\nI will tell you what I know.[VAR 0114(000B)]
12	Oh, thank you, Hapu![VAR 0114(0006)]
13	But what I know is not much.\c\nJust that there is a ceremony held for the\nLegendary Pokémon at the altar.\c\nA ceremony that uses two particular flutes to\nsomehow give the Legendary Pokémon power.[VAR 0114(000B)]
14	This is the Moon Flute.\nIt seems that my mother had it...[VAR 0114(0006)]
15	This is the Sun Flute.\nIt seems that my mother had it...[VAR 0114(0006)]
16	Ho! That looks to be the flute that used to\nreside at the lake on Ula’ula.[VAR 0114(000B)]
17	The other is said to be held on Exeggutor Island.\c\nI do not know why there of all places, but it has\nbeen passed down that that’s where it belongs.[VAR 0114(000B)]
18	Exeggutor Island...\nI think I’ve read about it before.\c\nIt’s an uninhabited island off the coast of Poni,\nisn’t that right?[VAR 0114(0006)]
19	Yes. And no reason to dally here.\nLet us go and speak with Mina.\c\nLillie, you take Mudsdale.\nWe proceed to Seafolk Village![VAR 0114(000B)]
336
0	Thank you, Hapu!\nAnd thank you, Mudsdale![VAR 0114(0006)]
1	That’s what friends do.[VAR 0114(000B)]
2	F-friends...?\c\nAn amazing Trainer like Hapu considers me...\na friend?[VAR 0114(0006)]
3	I am so glad I got to meet you, Hapu![VAR 0114(0006)]
4	To journey to Exeggutor Island, you should\nspeak with Mina.\r\nShe can help arrange a boat for you.\c\nI shall be wishing for your safety![VAR 0114(000B)]
5	Mu-hiiiiiin!
337
0	Did you find out anything useful?[VAR 0114(0012)]
1	[~ 1]
2	Yes!\nAnd Hapu was made the new kahuna![VAR 0114(0006)]
3	Little Hapu was?\c\nWe’ve been having old man Nanu look after our\ngrand trials up until now.[VAR 0114(0012)]
4	Heh! Now we’ve got our own little kahuna!\nThat’s great![VAR 0114(0012)]
5	[~ 5]
6	Yes.\nHapu will do her best for her late grandfather...\c\nas I must do my best for my mother’s sake.\nAnd for Nebby, as well.\c\nA-and so!\nThere’s a place that we need to go.[VAR 0114(0006)]
7	Exeggutor Island
8	To find the flute
9	Exeggutor Island?\nOh, where the flute is... Right![VAR 0114(0012)]
10	Where the flute is...?\nOh! You mean Exeggutor Island, right?[VAR 0114(0012)]
11	Well, in that case, we’d better get the chief![VAR 0114(0012)]
12	Did you call me?![VAR 0114(0030)]
13	Oh my goodness![VAR 0114(0006)]
14	Nice to meet you.\c\nI’m the chief of the seafolk.\c\nI couldn’t help overhearing what you said.\nSo why don’t I get you to Exeggutor Island?
15	Oh, thank you![VAR 0114(0006)]
16	Hold up there, little lady!\c\nIt’s [VAR 0100(0000)] who will go on this trip.\n[VAR 1100(00FF,0201)]HShe is a Trainer, after all.\c\nAnd Exeggutor Island is a pretty crazy place...[VAR 0114(0012)]
17	Ha, that’s true!\nThere are some crazy critters on that island!\c\nIt’s one thing for a Trainer to go, but if you’re\nnot a Trainer, you should just trust your friend\r\nto take care of this task for you.
18	But...[VAR 0114(0006)]
19	[VAR 0100(0000)]...[VAR 0114(0006)]
20	I’ve got this!
21	You just wait here
22	You’re right. I’m sure you and [VAR 0101(0001)]\ncan handle it better than anyone else could.\r\nI’ll wait here for you to come back![VAR 0114(0006)]
23	And while we’re waiting for [VAR 0100(0000)]...\nI’ll make you model for a picture, Lillie![VAR 0114(0012)]
24	Exeggutor Island...?\nOh, you mean where the flute is!
25	To find the flute?\nOh, you must want Exeggutor Island!
26	Well, you two did meet the kahuna already...\c\nand Poni’s captain ain’t around anyway, so\nI guess there’s no point waiting on any trials...
27	All right! The S.S. Magikarp will have you there,\nand you’ll think you’re sailing in a dream!
338
0	Hah... Here we are at Exeggutor Island!\c\nI heard that this place used to be a trial site,\nthough that was a long time ago now.
1	Hm? Looks like the fellows are even more\nworked up than usual.\c\nEh. But they’re always a noisy bunch.\nIt’s probably fine.
2	You go on. Good luck!
3	You want to go back to Poni Island?
4	Fair enough. Let’s be going.
5	I’ll wait around for you then.
6	Let’s go find that flute! Right?\c\nTrainers really can go anywhere as long as\nthey have their Pokémon, can’t they?\r\nI think I’m beginning to understand the appeal.[VAR 0114(0006)]
7	You want to head back to Exeggutor Island?
8	You wanna go to Exeggutor Island, that perfect\nparadise for Exeggutor?
9	Well, all right then. Let’s be going!
10	Fair enough. Maybe next time!
339
0	I feel like Trainers can open up the door to\nany future as long as they have their Pokémon.\c\nThat’s what it looks like to me when I see you,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]. And Hapu and Hau, too![VAR 0114(0006)]
1	Ahhh!\nWhat is that, [VAR 0100(0000)]?![VAR 0114(0006)]
2	Phew...\nThat was an Exeggutor, wasn’t it?\c\nI think that the good weather in Alola has let it\ngrow a bit more vigorously than I’d prefer![VAR 0114(0006)]
340
0	Oh! It’s started to rain...[VAR 0114(0006)]
341
0	The Coconut Pokémon, Exeggutor, is acting\na bit odd...
1	Hyah!
2	Gruh!
3	Thwak!
4	The Exeggutor is waving its heads around\nhappily now that the Pinsir was chased off!
5	There doesn’t seem to be any path leading\nahead from here...
6	The Exeggutor lifted you up in thanks!
7	You slid down Exeggutor’s long, long neck!
342
0	Rain in Alola, huh...\c\nMy skirt got a bit wet...[VAR 0114(0006)]
1	Looking out at the rain like this...\nreminds me of this one time when I was little.[VAR 0114(0006)]
2	I’d seen it in a movie...\c\nthis man singing and dancing in the rain.\c\nIt captivated me so much that I had to try it\nfor myself.\c\nMy mother spotted me out in the rain, and she\nwas so shocked that she ran right out after me\r\nwithout even bothering to get an umbrella...[VAR 0114(0006)]
3	And then...she smiled...\nand she danced with me in the rain.\c\nOf course we both ended up catching cold.\c\nShe let me sleep in her big bed with her.\nI was so happy that I kept waking her again\r\nand again, just to be sure it wasn’t a dream...[VAR 0114(0006)]
4	But...\c\nthen she changed.\c\nAnd all she would think about was the\nUltra Beasts.\c\nAnd Null and Nebby...\c\nThey both ended up suffering so much...\nand I couldn’t do anything...[VAR 0114(0006)]
5	But you know what, [VAR 0100(0000)]?\c\nWhenever I feel like there’s nothing I can do,\nyou seem to show up and...you do something.\c\nEvery time, you’ve shown me that it’s possible...\nto do something.[VAR 0114(0006)]
6	Even the first time we met...\c\nNebby was being attacked, and all I could do\nwas look on in horror...[VAR 0114(0006)]
7	And at Aether Paradise...\c\nall I could do was wait for you and the\nothers to save me...[VAR 0114(0006)]
8	Whenever I’m in any sort of trouble, you’re\nalways there...[VAR 0114(0006)]
9	I...[VAR 0114(0006)]
10	Um...\n[VAR 0100(0000)]?\c\nWhat are you going to do...once you finish your\nisland challenge?[VAR 0114(0006)]
11	Fill my Pokédex
12	Get stronger
13	I don’t know
14	It must be nice, knowing what you want to do.\nI really admire that.[VAR 0114(0006)]
15	Oh, thank goodness...\c\nIt’s such a relief to know that even someone\nlike you feels unsure at times, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0006)]
16	I think...I’d like to become a Trainer, too.\nAnd travel together with you, [VAR 0100(0000)]...[VAR 0114(0006)]
17	I want to become a Trainer, and learn all the\nthings you know, [VAR 0100(0000)]...[VAR 0114(0006)]
18	... ... ...\n... ... ...[VAR 0114(0006)]
19	Ah![VAR 0114(0006)]
20	Maybe there really are good omens sometimes,\nwouldn’t you say?[VAR 0114(0006)]
343
0	[VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0006)]
1	A flute is placed on a very old pedestal...
2	Will you take the flute?
3	You obtained the Sun Flute!
4	You obtained the Moon Flute!
5	Now we have both the Sun Flute and the\nMoon Flute![VAR 0114(0006)]
6	I don’t know if it will really summon the\nLegendary Pokémon, but we can at least try!\c\nIf nothing else, we’ll have sounded the flutes in\noffering like people used to do.\c\nSo thank you for coming this far with me,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0006)]
7	Let’s go meet the chief of the seafolk and\nget back to Poni Island![VAR 0114(0006)]
344
0	Welcome back, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0006)]
1	Now you’ve got to play those flutes up at the\naltar, I guess.\c\nThe altar can be found in the deepest part of\nthe Vast Poni Canyon.[VAR 0114(0012)]
2	Those Exeggutor sure took a liking to you.\c\nYou’ve clearly got something important in you,\nas a Trainer, if Pokémon like you that much.
345
0	Here they come![VAR 0114(0031)]
1	You’re from Team Skull.\nWhat is it that you want from us?[VAR 0114(0006)]
2	I heard about you numskulls at Aether.\c\nDo you really know how to open an Ultra\nWormhole and save our boy Guzma?![VAR 0114(0031)]
3	Lemme see if you really are bad to\nthe bone enough to save our boy Guzma![VAR 0114(0032)]
4	OK, no bones about it—you’re way stronger\nthan me![VAR 0114(0032)]
5	Doesn’t matter! We’ll come after you with all our\nPokémon at once then, li’l home slice!\c\nWe’ll give 500 percent to save our boy Guzma![VAR 0114(0031)]
6	I may have lost, but listen up, yo! Please save\nGuzma for us![VAR 0114(0031)]
7	You dummies.\c\nThey’re trying to save the boss, so what do you\nwanna get in their way for?![VAR 0114(0018)]
8	Hmmph. You, girlie...\c\nLillie, right?[VAR 0114(0018)]
9	You really ready to do this finally?[VAR 0114(0018)]
10	To be honest, I’ve treated you really badly.\c\nEven if I was just doing the work the president\ntold me to do, I shouldn’t have done all that.\c\nEven if I apologize now, I know it’s probably too\nlate for you to forgive me, though.[VAR 0114(0018)]
11	See, Guzma...\c\nhe really likes the president.\c\nShe’s the only adult who ever seemed to see\nhow strong he was.[VAR 0114(0018)]
12	The president...\c\nMy mother is—\nShe’s selfish.\c\nShe decides all by herself what she thinks\nneeds to be done to make other people happy,\r\nnot even caring what it is they may want...[VAR 0114(0006)]
13	But people ought to help one another out!\nThat is what I have learned here in Alola!\r\nAnd that is what I’m going to teach her, too.\c\nThen I think we can save Mr. Guzma.[VAR 0114(0006)]
14	You know...deep down, you’re kind of like\nthe president.\c\nYou’ve gone in a different direction, but I can tell\nyou have the same strength in your convictions.[VAR 0114(0018)]
15	[VAR 0100(0000)]... Lillie...\nI know you’ve got no reason to help, but...\c\nBut could you help us save Guzma?[VAR 0114(0018)]
16	That big dummy...\nI don’t think he’s even aware of it, but...\c\nAlola really means a lot to him. That’s why he’s\ndoing something so reckless to try to save it.[VAR 0114(0018)]
17	The Poison-type Z-Crystal...\nMaybe it’ll help you somehow.[VAR 0114(0018)]
18	I guess giving you this Z-Crystal is also kind of,\nwhat did you call it, helping each other?\c\nOh yeah...\c\nYou got your first stone directly from Tapu\nKoko, didn’t you, [VAR 0100(0000)]?\c\nYou’d better take care of it. That’s one special\nZ-Power Ring you’ve got there.[VAR 0114(0018)]
19	A Trainer is only a Trainer because of the\nPokémon with them.\c\nIf you ever forget that, you’ll bring the wrath\nof the tapu down upon yourself.\c\nYou should be fine, though.[VAR 0114(0018)]
20	I’m out of here.[VAR 0114(0018)]
21	I suppose even Team Skull is not all bad...\c\nThanks for helping me again, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nAnd here, let me thank your team, too![VAR 0114(0006)]
22	All right, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nLet’s finally go to the altar!\c\nThe Vast Poni Canyon lies ahead of us![VAR 0114(0006)]

0	Did everything go well?[VAR 0114(000B)]
1	Well, I...[VAR 0114(0006)]
2	I had to have [VAR 0100(0000)] do everything for\nme yet again, but...[VAR 0114(0006)]
3	Nothing wrong with that, Lillie.\c\nPeople cannot survive all on their own.\nThey have got to help one another out.\c\nSame for Pokémon, too.\c\nThat is what my grandfather used to say.[VAR 0114(000B)]
4	Ni-hiii!
5	It’s that kindness of yours, [VAR 0100(0000)],\nthat keeps that brilliant smile on Lillie’s face.[VAR 0114(000B)]
6	Please wait.[VAR 0114(0036)]
7	We have been betrayed by Lusamine...\c\nAnd now we are expected to put our faith in a\nchild like you next?[VAR 0114(0036)]
8	Even if we are still weak, we have also\nlearned to do battle with Pokémon...\c\nWe should be the ones to resolve the situation\nwith Necrozma ourselves![VAR 0114(0036)]
9	I will defeat you, and we will handle things with\nour own power this time![VAR 0114(0036)]
10	Can we not stand up against the long history\nof a region like Alola, where the culture of\r\nPokémon battling has had so long to develop?[VAR 0114(0036)]
11	Mm-hmm. The people of Alola get along and get\nto know each other through Pokémon battles.[VAR 0114(0037)]
12	Please wait.[VAR 0114(0039)]
13	Just as you use your own strength to overcome\nthe trials before you...\c\nperhaps it is time that we stop relying on others\nand instead take matters into our own hands.[VAR 0114(0039)]
14	Now that we have learned to do Pokémon\nbattle ourselves, I think we might be able to\r\nresolve the situation with Necrozma on our own.[VAR 0114(0039)]
15	If I am strong enough, then we can do it.\nIf I am only strong enough to defeat you![VAR 0114(0039)]
16	This is...astounding!\c\nYou show such skill for drawing forth the\npower from your Pokémon![VAR 0114(0039)]
17	Yes...\c\nThe people of Alola battle their Pokémon\nagainst one another to learn more about each\r\nother, after all.[VAR 0114(0038)]
18	Greetings.\nI am the kahuna of this island. Hapu.[VAR 0114(000B)]
19	You are from the beasts’ world, are you not?\c\nWe in Alola have long lived together with our\nPokémon, being aided by them to survive.[VAR 0114(000B)]
20	If you are in some sort of trouble, then we will\ngladly come to your aid however we can.[VAR 0114(000B)]
21	That is most generous of you...[VAR 0114(0036)]
22	When Necrozma comes, then...will you battle it?[VAR 0114(0036)]
23	Then I will throw myself upon your generosity,\nin spite of our own shortcomings.[VAR 0114(0039)]

30	Ahaha! Now, don’t be hasty, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nLook at the state of your Pokémon.\c\nWe have got to have them in peak condition for\nthis to be a fair fight.[VAR 0114(000B)]
31	Oho...\nYou sure showed me.[VAR 0114(000B)]
32	That was enjoyable.\c\nLooks like I cannot beat you even when I am not\nholding back...\c\nI appreciate this chance, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nIt has really taught me a few things.[VAR 0114(000B)]
33	Take your Ground-type Z-Crystal then...\nThis Groundium Z is yours![VAR 0114(000B)]
34	I will teach you the pose, too, so eyes up here![VAR 0114(000B)]
35	Hyah![VAR 0114(000B)]
36	Phew...\c\nWell, I must applaud you, Lillie. You sure found\na prodigious Trainer to befriend.[VAR 0114(000B)]
37	Then go on with you two!\nHead straight through here and find the altar![VAR 0114(000B)]
38	Well then!\nThe path to the shrine is through the canyon.\c\nYou will find other Trainers in this place, though.\nThey come for training. It will be a tough road.[VAR 0114(000B)]
39	You will have to pitch in, too, Lillie.\c\nBut if you two end up in any real trouble,\nMudsdale and I will hasten to you.[VAR 0114(000B)]
40	Thank you, Hapu.\nI will do all I can to help [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0006)]
41	Come!\c\nIf you want to proceed to that canyon, you will\nhave to get through me and my grand trial![VAR 0114(000B)]
42	First we must accept these people and beasts\nfrom other worlds into our hearts.\c\nThat is how we do things here in Alola.[VAR 0114(000B)]
43	I wonder if a Trainer would even be able to\nbefriend a beast like Necrozma...[VAR 0114(0037)]
44	What is it that we should do?\nMust we start by putting our faith in you?[VAR 0114(0039)]

2	Oh, yes! [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nHere, take this.[VAR 0114(0006)]
3	It’s a Max Revive I found in Aether Paradise.[VAR 0114(0006)]
4	When I—\c\nOnce I am ready, I am going to come after you,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]. I am going to catch up to you.\c\nFor Nebby’s sake...\nand for my mother’s sake, too.[VAR 0114(0006)]
5	Oh, yes...\nBut let me first make sure that [VAR 0101(0001)]\r\n[VAR 1101(00FD,1D06)]is alland the rest of your team are ready for battle![VAR 0114(0006)]
6	Being together with your favorite Pokémon is\neven better when they’re all feeling their best![VAR 0114(0006)]

0	Phew...\nThis canyon truly is a difficult path to walk.\c\nAnd you even make the Vast Poni Canyon seem\nlike nothing at all, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0006)]
1	This bridge reminds me of the first time that I\nmet you, [VAR 0100(0000)]...[VAR 0114(0006)]
2	I’d taken Nebby with me, but I didn’t have the\ncourage to protect it myself...[VAR 0114(0006)]
3	I couldn’t do anything...\nBut I’m not that person anymore![VAR 0114(0006)]
4	Oh...[VAR 0114(0006)]
5	[VAR 0100(0000)]! I did it!\nI made it all the way across![VAR 0114(0006)]
6	Someday...\c\nI’d like to be more like you, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nI want to fight together with Pokémon and\nbecome strong enough to outdo even myself.[VAR 0114(0006)]

9	Hee hee![VAR 0114(0006)]
10	Oh, you spoilsport![VAR 0114(0006)]
11	But it’s really thanks to you, [VAR 0100(0000)]...\nYou’re the reason why I’ve come so far!\c\nStill...I think I’ll take a little rest here.\c\nI’m afraid my legs are still shaking![VAR 0114(0006)]
12	[VAR 0101(0001)], do you want a rest, too?[VAR 0114(0006)]
13	Don’t worry. I’ve got you covered!\c\nI have Hyper Potions and Revives and even\nlots of Ethers, too.\c\nThough I’m not sure I brought enough Max\nRepels for a path like this one...[VAR 0114(0006)]

3	When your Pokémon are full of energy, then a\nTrainer can go anywhere in the world...\r\nDoesn’t it seem that way?[VAR 0114(0006)]

15	You mean...it wants Z-Crystals?![VAR 0114(0017)]
16	It’s true [VAR 0100(0000)] has an awfully large\nnumber of Z-Crystals after coming so far in h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]iser\r\nisland challenge...[VAR 0114(0006)]

19	We call it the Ultra Warp Ride!\c\nIf you want to go after Necrozma, you’ll need to\nreach the [VAR FF00(0001)]white warp hole[VAR FF00(0000)] and go through it.\c\nAny other warp hole will send you to a different\nworld altogether.[VAR 0114(0037)]
20	It is not in our power to fight with Solgaleo.\c\nBut we do borrow its power to travel through\nthe Ultra Wormholes.\c\nYou have shown us what you are capable of,\nthough, by summoning Lunala to this place.\r\nPerhaps you could ride upon our Solgaleo.\r\nYes...

2	While you were battling Necrozma in our Ultra\nMegalopolis, we were able to make some\r\ndiscoveries about the auras here in Alola.[VAR 0114(0036)]
3	The auras of Alola came from Necrozma! They’re\nthe remnants of the light it emitted long ago![VAR 0114(0037)]
4	These...auras...must have been particularly\nstrong at the trial locations. And the Z-Power\r\nfor the Z-Moves... It is also similar to the auras\r\nof the Totem Pokémon. Both came to Alola as\r\nNecrozma’s light![VAR 0114(0036)]
5	You are such a powerful Trainer... Maybe you\ncan return the light to Necrozma, without having\r\nit run wild.[VAR 0114(0036)]

11	While you faced Necrozma in our Ultra\nMegalopolis, there are some things we found out\r\nabout the auras that fill Alola...[VAR 0114(0038)]
12	Before our ancestors were forced to contain it,\nNecrozma emitted powerful light... That light is\r\nwhat you call auras![VAR 0114(0038)]
13	That light must have passed through the Ultra\nWormholes and rained down throughout Alola...\c\nIndeed, this must be how the trial sites got\ntheir unique properties.[VAR 0114(0039)]
14	Yes... Both the Z-Power for the Z-Moves and\nthe auras of the Totem Pokémon are powers\r\ngifted to you by Necrozma.[VAR 0114(0038)]
15	A Trainer as gifted as yourself may be able to\nreturn the light to Necrozma, without sending\r\nit into another rage.[VAR 0114(0039)]
16	As thanks for your help, we will continue to\nshare our Solgaleo with you freely.\c\nYou should be able to meet many amazing \nPokémon by using Ultra Warp Ride to explore\r\ndifferent worlds![VAR 0114(0038)]
17	It would not be a bad idea to continue research\non Alola, with all of its Z-Power!\c\nThere’s much for us to learn here, no doubt.[VAR 0114(0039)]

30	I may not have been able to do anything for you,\nNebby...but I’m still glad I took you that day.\c\nSo go with [VAR 0100(0000)] and see the world!\c\nHave battles against strong Pokémon where you\ncan use your full power.\c\nMeet other Trainers who will make your heart\ndance with the thrill of it all...\c\nThat’s the kind of world that [VAR 0100(0000)]\ncan share with you![VAR 0114(0006)]
31	If it’s you, [VAR 0100(0000)]...\nI know I can trust you to raise my Nebby well.\r\nTake good care of it![VAR 0114(0006)]
32	And I...will go to my mother.\c\nI need to see for myself that she’ll be all right.[VAR 0114(0006)]
33	Nebby!\c\nDon’t always be trying to get out of your\nPoké Ball the way you always wriggled out\r\nof my Bag![VAR 0114(0006)]
34	And...and don’t forget that you’re strong now.\nYou’ll have to be careful not to accidentally\r\nhurt anyone until you get used to your strength![VAR 0114(0006)]
35	And...and you can’t just go running off to some\nother world anytime without telling anyone!\r\nYou’ll make [VAR 0100(0000)] worry![VAR 0114(0006)]

0	Cripes, but I hate this place...\nIt’s exhausting climbing all the way up here.[VAR 0114(000A)]
1	At least you gave me a good show, though.\c\nGuess it was worth coming this far.\nAnd the prof did ask me and all...[VAR 0114(000A)]
2	Look, once you’ve completed all your island\ntrials and done your grand trials, then you’ve\r\ngot to do one last thing...\c\nThe final trial.[VAR 0114(000A)]
3	Basically it’s a ceremony, you see?\nYou beat all four kahunas in a row.\r\nBut things are a little different this year.\c\nNow that we’re getting a real Pokémon League\nhere in Alola, too.[VAR 0114(000A)]
4	So, boy.\c\nI hope you can bother yourself to come along to\nthe base of Ula’ula Island’s Mount Lanakila.\c\nYou remember Tapu Village, don’t you?\nWhere they’ve got a Pokémon Center?\c\nHe’ll be ready and waiting for you there.[VAR 0114(000A)]

6	I suppose I could take you along with me...\nYou want to do that? Come now, with me?[VAR 0114(000A)]
7	Looks like we’re on this journey together, then.[VAR 0114(000A)]
8	Not many kids make it all the way to the final\ntrial, but there’s a handful every year.\c\nYou won’t be able to go easy on this one.\nThese are real battles. No holding back.[VAR 0114(000A)]

0	Desiiiiii!
1	Rawr!
2	Mariii!
3	Hey! I know you’re happy that we beat Ilima and\nall, but you’ve still gotta wait for me, partner![VAR 0114(0007)]
4	Oh! Hey, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nI heard the news from Gladion, you know.\nSavior of Alola, huh? Heh heh!\c\nI’m glad I got to set out on my island challenge\ntogether with such an awesome Trainer.[VAR 0114(0007)]
5	But I’m not slacking off, either!\c\nIt’s good to have fun in battle, sure...\c\nBut losing a battle because all you’re really\ndoing is having fun is...well...\c\nYou can’t let down your Pokémon when they’re\nfighting their hardest for you, now can you?[VAR 0114(0007)]
6	Right, [VAR 0101(0001)]?[VAR 0114(0007)]
7	Desiiiiii!
8	Rawr!
9	Mariii!
10	I know you want to win...\nAnd I’m gonna make sure that happens![VAR 0114(0007)]
11	And here, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nHave a Max Elixir!\c\nYou should go ahead and use one when battle\nis dragging on and on![VAR 0114(0007)]
12	When we’re both done with our island\nchallenges, we should have a serious battle.\r\nYou and me.\c\nPokémon and their Trainers have gotta have\ntheir hearts in the same place if they’re gonna\r\nwin in battle!\r\nThat’s the way to really have a blast together![VAR 0114(0007)]
385
0	Walking across Ula’ula Island really makes you\nfeel how big it is, doesn’t it?[VAR 0114(0010)]
1	Well, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nGood luck with Mina’s trial.[VAR 0114(0010)]
2	Oh, it’s you...[VAR 0114(0017)]
3	Look, kid...\c\nAbout what happened with Necrozma...\nI guess I should...\c\nThanks. I’m saying thanks. OK?[VAR 0114(0017)]
4	Hey!\nIf it isn’t [VAR 0100(0000)] and Guzma!\r\nWhat’re the two of you doing together?[VAR 0114(0007)]
5	The kahuna’s grandson, huh...\nWe’re not doin’ nothin’.[VAR 0114(0017)]
6	Oh yeah!\nI’ve got something I wanted to ask you, Guzma!\c\nThat Golisopod you’ve got, yeah...[VAR 0114(0007)]
7	Huh? This dude?\nYeah, he’s been with me since before I started\r\nout on my island challenge. My partner.[VAR 0114(0017)]
8	There ain’t nobody in Team Skull who can beat\nmy Golisopod.\c\nThe rest of my team, too. I met them all during\nmy island challenge and trained ’em up as\r\ngood as anything.\c\n...Not that any of that matters now.[VAR 0114(0017)]
9	So you got to meet your Pokémon partners by\ndoing the island challenge and made some\r\nreally great friends, too, huh?[VAR 0114(0007)]
10	Friends?
11	He did?
12	You know! Everybody in Team Skull!\c\nThey all really love Guzma after all, right?[VAR 0114(0007)]
13	You’ll meet Pokémon and people on your journey\nthat’ll enrich your life. Is that it?\c\n...Geez.\nYou really are old Hala’s grandson...[VAR 0114(0017)]
14	Who knows? Maybe kids like you can make the\nisland challenge actually mean something again.[VAR 0114(0017)]
15	Here. I don’t need this anymore.[VAR 0114(0017)]
16	Ho...\nHere it comes again. The winds of Alola are\r\nblowing again, bringing some new change.[VAR 0114(0017)]
17	Just you wait, Guzma!\c\nI’m gonna outdo even the kahunas!\c\nAnd I’m gonna make sure everybody knows they\ncan be something great, whether they choose\r\nto do the island challenge or not![VAR 0114(0007)]
18	You didn’t fail to become a captain, Guzma!\nNo matter what you might think!\c\nSo go become something else—something that\nnobody else has ever managed to be![VAR 0114(0007)]
19	[VAR 0100(0000)]!\nConsider this one last warning!\c\nI told you before, but once we both finish up our\nisland challenges, we’re gonna have a serious\r\nbattle—you and me![VAR 0114(0007)]
386
0	You did an admirable job completing Mina’s trial.[VAR 0114(000B)]
1	Meaning...[VAR 0114(000B)]
2	Meaning?
3	Grand trial time?
4	Yes, it is time for your grand trial!\nI’ll await your arrival on Exeggutor Island.[VAR 0114(000B)]
5	So the time has come for you to wrap up your\nisland challenge.[VAR 0114(0008)]
6	I even had an all-out battle against Hau,\nholding nothing at all back...\r\nand I was defeated in spectacular fashion![VAR 0114(0008)]
7	The island challenge helps you all grow, and\nyou in turn will help Alola keep changing...\r\nI can’t imagine anything more delightful![VAR 0114(0008)]
387
0	Little Hapu is out on Exeggutor Island.\nYou want to go and meet her, don’t ya?
1	All right! The S.S. Magikarp will have you there,\nand you’ll think you’re sailing in a dream!
2	I’ll wait around for you then.
388
0	Here ya are!\nExeggutor Island!
1	You go on. Good luck!
2	You want to go back to Poni Island?
3	Fair enough. Let’s be going.
4	I’ll wait around for you then.
389
0	Do you want to try to take me and my Pokémon\non at our full strength?[VAR 0114(000B)]
1	Only if you’ll take on mine
2	I need to prepare first
3	Heh.\nI will be awaiting you, then.[VAR 0114(000B)]
4	Then allow me to show you the power of the\nkahuna chosen by Tapu Fini itself![VAR 0114(000B)]
5	I am Kahuna Hapu!\c\nAnd with the Sparkling Stone entrusted to me\nby the tapu, I have made this Z-Power Ring![VAR 0114(000B)]
6	[VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nHaving Z-Power Rings as we do means that\nwe battle with the tapu beside us.[VAR 0114(000B)]
7	This is the first grand trial of Kahuna Hapu!\c\nI will battle you with everything that I have got![VAR 0114(000B)]
8	Hyah![VAR 0114(000B)]
9	Phew...\c\nYou are undoubtedly a prodigious\nTrainer, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(000B)]
10	You have succeeded in your final grand trial![VAR 0114(000B)]
11	In the past, any Trainer who completed the\nisland challenge would make a pilgrimage to\r\nMount Lanakila to battle the kahunas once more.\c\nIn these battles alone, the kahunas would no\nlonger hold back in any way.[VAR 0114(000B)]
12	But this year, you will face a different sort of\nfinal trial upon Mount Lanakila.\c\nThat will be your next destination, but first let\nus return to Poni Island.[VAR 0114(000B)]
390
0	The new final trial awaits you upon Mount\nLanakila, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nYou can begin your trek up Mount Lanakila from\nTapu Village on Ula’ula Island.[VAR 0114(000B)]
391
0	I’ve been waiting for you.\c\nTo thank you.\c\nFor what you did for Lillie. For our mother.\c\nI appreciate it.\nMaybe more than you know.[VAR 0114(0013)]
1	And the only thing I can offer you in thanks\nis a great battle.\c\nSo I’m going to show my full power...\nMy real full power this time!\r\nWith the Z-Power Ring that old man gave me![VAR 0114(0013)]
2	You’ve got [VAR 1101(00FD,0002)]a good Pokémon.\c\nI know what kind of Trainer you are now.\nAnd what kind of journey you’ve been through.[VAR 0114(0013)]
3	I know why you of all people could save Lillie.\nWhy you could save Cosmog...and Alola.[VAR 0114(0013)]
4	Last time I saw Lillie, she was heading up to\nMahalo Trail...\r\nIt seemed like she had something on her mind.[VAR 0114(0013)]
5	She’s...she’s gentle enough to be able to feel\nhow much pain Pokémon go through.\r\nI guess that’s a kind of strength, too.[VAR 0114(0013)]
6	Here. Take this.\nShe wanted me to give it to you.[VAR 0114(0013)]
7	You know, I tried battling Hau, too...\nHe’s really changed.\c\nI’m not surprised anymore that he managed to\nbeat even Kahuna Hala.[VAR 0114(0013)]
8	Hmph...\c\nIf you two are going to get even stronger, then\nI guess I can’t let down my guard yet.[VAR 0114(0013)]
9	I know we aren’t friends.\c\nBut we aren’t enemies anymore either.\c\nKeep winning. Maybe I’ll see you again if you do.[VAR 0114(0013)]
392
0	[VAR 0100(0000)]!\nHold up for me![VAR 0114(0007)]
1	So after we split up at Aether Paradise, I went\nand cleared all the rest of my trials, and then\r\nI even went back home to train with Ilima a bit.[VAR 0114(0007)]
2	I was just thinking it was time to take on the\nPokémon League...\c\nThen I heard from Gladion that you were already\nheading here, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nSo I booked it here as fast as I could![VAR 0114(0007)]
3	That was, like, the fastest I’ve ever moved in\nmy life, you know![VAR 0114(0007)]
4	But that’s not what I came here to tell you![VAR 0114(0007)]
5	[VAR 0100(0000)]!\nWe’re gonna decide which one of us’ll be the\r\nfirst to the Pokémon League!\c\nYou’re gonna need to use your full force if you\nthink you’re gonna beat me and my team when\r\nwe’re serious about winning![VAR 0114(0007)]
6	Ooooh, and I really wanted my Pokémon to know\nhow it feels to beat your team this time!\c\nBut being seriously frustrated will only make\nme stronger![VAR 0114(0007)]
7	So you’d better go and become Champion.\c\n’Cause I’m gonna train so that next time I can\ncome beat Champion [VAR 0100(0000)]!\r\nGood luck, cuz, and here![VAR 0114(0007)]
8	I’m really glad that the kid who moved here to\nAlola turned out to be you, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0007)]

0	Necrozma has fallen to the ground, weak and\ndrained of power...
1	Will you share the light of your Z-Power Ring\nwith Necrozma?
2	Yes
3	No
4	Linooo!
5	Necrozma disappeared off somewhere...
6	You found a Z-Crystal that fell from Necrozma...
7	You obtained the Ultranecrozium Z!
8	Splendid![VAR 0114(002B)]
9	It’s been a while, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nYou must be a formidable Trainer indeed if you\nare able to get Necrozma as one of your allies.[VAR 0114(002B)]
10	Good!\nAnd this is from me!\c\nThe Ultra Recon Squad asked me to develop a\ndevice that would be able to control Necrozma.\r\nBut I improved it to my own liking!\c\nAnd now it is a device that makes it possible to\ndraw out even more power from Necrozma![VAR 0114(002B)]
11	Good!\nAnd this is from me!\c\nThe Ultra Recon Squad asked me to develop a\ndevice that would be able to control Necrozma.\r\nBut I improved it to my own liking!\c\nAnd now it is a device that makes it possible to\ndraw out even more power from Necrozma![VAR 0114(002B)]
12	Yes, in short, it makes it possible for Necrozma\nto fuse with the Legendary Pokémon Solgaleo!\c\nThis is the Colress Machine No. 1198, officially\ndubbed the N-Solarizer![VAR 0114(002B)]
13	In addition, this is the Colress Machine\nNo. 1199, officially dubbed the N-Lunarizer!\c\nIt makes it possible for Necrozma to fuse with\nthe Legendary Pokémon, Lunala![VAR 0114(002B)]
14	Ah yes. I have heard in fact that you first met\nSolgaleo—no, its pre-evolved Cosmog—upon\r\nMahalo Trail.[VAR 0114(002B)]
15	Ah yes. I have heard in fact that you first met\nLunala—no, its pre-evolved Cosmog—upon\r\nMahalo Trail.[VAR 0114(002B)]
16	I believe that a Trainer like you will be able to\nuse both Alola’s Legendary Pokémon and the\r\nfearsome power of Necrozma properly![VAR 0114(002B)]
17	I happen to know quite a bit about Pokémon\nfusion myself...\r\nBut that is a different tale.\c\nGood luck in your battles![VAR 0114(002B)]

8	There’s something I hope that Legendary\nPokémon knows:\c\nThis has always been the spot where we finish\nup the island challenge.\c\nWe wanted to put our Pokémon League right up\nhere, as close as we could get to the sun...\r\nto respect and honor you, Solgaleo![VAR 0114(0005)]
9	Hey now! Looks like you got the Legendary\nPokémon Lunala on your side![VAR 0114(0005)]
10	There’s something I hope that Legendary\nPokémon knows:\c\nThis has always been the spot where we finish\nup the island challenge.\c\nWe wanted to put our Pokémon League right up\nhere, as close as we could get to the moon...\r\nto respect and honor you, Lunala![VAR 0114(0005)]
11	Mount Lanakila is where we’ve always finished\nup the island challenge.\c\nWe built our Pokémon League right up here,\nas high into the heavens as we could get...\c\nto show our respect for our Legendary Pokémon\nand to honor it.[VAR 0114(0005)]
12	I still remember it like it was yesterday!\c\nI went all the way to Indigo Plateau, yeah, right\nto the Pokémon League headquarters...\r\nand I went right at them, cousin![VAR 0114(0005)]
13	Those Gym Leaders in Kanto really messed my\nteam and me up!\c\nBut then I saw my team battling for me through\nit all, pouring their souls into their moves for me.[VAR 0114(0005)]
14	And then that last guy, that Dragon user in\nthe cape...[VAR 0114(0005)]
15	Oh sorry! Enough about me—let’s get you in\nthere, yeah![VAR 0114(0005)]

1	Every Pokémon League in every region all over\nthe world features four fantastic Trainers called\r\nthe Elite Four.[VAR 0114(0005)]
2	Here in Alola, too, we’ve got four Trainers all\nlined up for our Pokémon League.[VAR 0114(0005)]
3	You’ll win your way past every last one of\nthem. You can’t leave until you do...\r\nor until you give up.[VAR 0114(0005)]
4	Sounds good!
5	Sounds...tough
6	[VAR 0101(0001)] can sense when its Trainer\nis nervous.\c\nStay loose! You’ll be fine![VAR 0114(0005)]
7	What’re you talking about?\c\nYou’re a great Trainer in your own right, plus\nyou’ve got [VAR 0101(0001)] on your side![VAR 0114(0005)]
8	I expect you to show me some intense moves\nand real heart-stopping battles in there!\r\nGood luck, [VAR 0100(0000)]! [VAR 0101(0001)]![VAR 0114(0005)]

0	Old Hala is here to make you holler!
1	Your old kahuna is now also a member\nof the Elite Four.\c\nWell, this time I’m holding nothing back! Time for\nyou to see what I can really do![VAR 0114(0008)]
2	It is only when the balance of the\nold and the new is just right that you can\r\ncreate something truly original.\c\nThat is what I saw in the battle between us.\nAn elder’s experience and the fire of youth![VAR 0114(0008)]
3	Welcome, Champion, to the Pokémon League,\nwhere strength is everything!\c\nNow, with love in our hearts, let us clash in\nPokémon battle![VAR 0114(0008)]
4	A heart-pounding battle like that always sends\na shiver through my whole body! I’m sure my\r\nPokémon felt it, too![VAR 0114(0008)]
5	Oh ho ho! So it’s me who faced you first.\c\nDefeating the Elite Four will become a fine\npart of our island challenge![VAR 0114(0008)]
6	Oh ho ho! So I was the second to face you?\c\nSome people would say you’re halfway there,\nwhile some may say you’ve still got halfway\r\nto go. How you see it is up to you.[VAR 0114(0008)]
7	Oh ho ho! So I was the third to face you?\c\nIf you’ll take a bit of advice from this old man,\nI wouldn’t let my guard down yet if I were you.[VAR 0114(0008)]
8	Oh ho ho! So I was the last to face you?\c\nBut then who do you think awaits you in the\nChampion’s chamber?[VAR 0114(0008)]

0	Hey!
1	Kukui asked me to, so I decided to be in the\nElite Four.\c\nI’m looking forward to battling against you\nand Sophocles in the Pokémon League.[VAR 0114(001C)]
2	Kukui made Trainers who he thought were\nstrong into members of the Elite Four, but he\r\ndidn’t choose any challengers. He’s waiting for a\r\nfresh breeze to blow through Alola.[VAR 0114(001C)]
3	The Pokémon League is fantastic!\c\nIt’s a place that conveys the awesomeness of\nAlola to the world.\c\nAnd in that case, I guess that what’s important\nis what kind of Trainer the Champion is.[VAR 0114(001C)]
4	Just as I’d expect from the Champion!\c\nIn every situation, you pick the best moves\nand items.\c\nSo I too have to rack my brain in the battle...[VAR 0114(001C)]
5	[VAR 0100(0000)]! You’re gonna be a Trainer who\neveryone admires.[VAR 0114(001C)]
6	In the battle with you, I realized the areas in\nwhich Sophocles needs to improve.[VAR 0114(001C)]
7	Battling with you is interesting! I think you outdo\neven Kukui. You’re second to none![VAR 0114(001C)]
8	Just what I’d expect of a Pokémon Trainer\ndiscovered by the Masked Royal.[VAR 0114(001C)]
399

1	No introduction needed here.\nTime to battle me, Olivia![VAR 0114(0009)]

3	I won’t be holding back!\c\nMy Rock-type Pokémon will grind you to dust!\c\nYour puny little Pokémon are going to go\ndown in one hit! Hah![VAR 0114(0009)]
4	What a spectacular Trainer you are!\c\nNow when the children of Alola finish their\nisland challenge, they can visit the Pokémon\r\nLeague to try to become the Champion!\c\nThe Trainers of Alola will become even stronger![VAR 0114(0009)]
5	You should get moving. You still have three\nmore rooms left, right?[VAR 0114(0009)]
6	Don’t stop now. You still have two more\nrooms left, right?[VAR 0114(0009)]
7	I’ll stay here and wonder why you left me\nwaiting so long for your challenge...[VAR 0114(0009)]
8	Let me guess...you’re the type who likes to\nsave the most delicious bite for the end of\r\nthe meal?[VAR 0114(0009)]
400
0	Hiya! Acerola here, bringing an old royal touch\nto the Pokémon League!
1	Nanu said maybe he can’t refuse a tapu\nchoosing him to serve as kahuna...\c\nBut he’d be darned if he had to serve as one of\nthe Elite Four just because some guy asked him!\c\nSo I guess I’ll just have to battle hard enough\nto make up for his not being here![VAR 0114(0011)]
2	Phew!\c\nWell, there goes my hope of beating you to\nsmithereens and becoming Champion myself![VAR 0114(0011)]
3	Hey, even if you are the Champion, you can’t\ngo into the Champion’s chamber without\r\nproving you can still get past the Elite Four!\c\nAnd besides...battling is just plain fun!\nCome on, I can take you![VAR 0114(0011)]
4	Being in the Elite Four is fun, but so is being a\ncaptain...\r\nHmm, I’m not sure which to do...[VAR 0114(0011)]
5	You’ve got three more Trainers to take on!\c\nThanks for picking me to battle first, while you\nwere still fresh and full of energy![VAR 0114(0011)]
6	You have two more Trainers to take on!\c\nAre you getting tired? If you are, and you still\nare beating us, then I guess we’ve got quite\r\na bit farther to go ourselves![VAR 0114(0011)]
7	You’ve made it to third base!\nNow you’ve just got to bring it home!\r\nOr would this be second base?\r\nI don’t really get baseball metaphors...[VAR 0114(0011)]
8	You’ve blasted right through the Elite Four!\nWell, first off, let me say congratulations!\c\nBut don’t lose your momentum now!\nJust keep storming ahead![VAR 0114(0011)]
401
0	So, here you are...\c\nWhy don’t we see who the winds favor today,\nyou...or me?
1	Alola! And alola once again!\nMy name is Kahili.\c\nA few years ago, I was a champion of the island\nchallenge, too. Just like you.\c\nI’ve been traveling the world to improve my skill\nas both a Trainer and as a golfer.\c\nWhen I heard that they’d made a Pokémon\nLeague in my own home region, I came flying\r\nback to serve Alola.\c\nHave a look at my fantastic Flying-type team![VAR 0114(0019)]
2	You know...I think you’ll bring a breath of fresh\nair to the Alola battle scene.\c\nI was honestly annoyed when Kukui kept\npestering me to come here, but I’m glad I did.[VAR 0114(0019)]
3	So, you came to battle me again!\c\nIf I beat you, the number one ranked Trainer in\nAlola, then I’ll be ready to take on the world!\c\nI’m coming for you, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0019)]
4	That battle was worthy of being number one\nin Alola...\c\nMaybe even number one in the world!\nBut next time, I’ll win. You’ll see![VAR 0114(0019)]
5	There are three more members of the Elite Four.\c\nAnd every one of them is a top-class Trainer.[VAR 0114(0019)]
6	There are two more members of the Elite Four...\c\nAnd I wouldn’t be surprised if you have a hard\ntime deciding which one to take on next.[VAR 0114(0019)]
7	There is just one member of the Elite Four left.\c\nI hope you enjoy the transcendent kind of battle\nyou only find at the top of the Pokémon League![VAR 0114(0019)]
8	Do you wonder what lies beyond the Elite Four?\c\nGo. See with your own eyes what awaits you.[VAR 0114(0019)]
402
0	Oh yeah, now you’re the\nPokémon League Champion![VAR 0114(0005)]
1	Wouldn’t it be nice if it was that simple?\c\nThe truth is, there’s one more person you have\nto battle if you want that title.[VAR 0114(0005)]
2	And of course that Trainer is me. Woo![VAR 0114(0005)]
3	Just kidding![VAR 0114(0005)]
4	It’s me![VAR 0114(0007)]
5	You know what?\c\nSomething kinda hit me after I finally beat my\nold gramps in an all-out serious battle.[VAR 0114(0007)]
6	You’re kinda my hero, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nYou and your team are, I mean![VAR 0114(0007)]
7	And because I really look up to you...\c\nI really wanna have a serious battle against you!\nI really want to be able to win against you!\c\n’Cause it’s way more fun when Pokémon and\ntheir Trainers are all friends and get along.\r\nThen they can do something really amazing![VAR 0114(0007)]
8	One final hurrah for your island challenge.\c\nAnd a special tribute as you and this\nPokémon League embark on a new path!\r\nLet’s have a battle worthy of this moment![VAR 0114(0005)]
9	We managed to pull off something pretty\namazing, when my partners and I were all in\r\nsync and wanting the same thing.\c\nBut looks like we’re still one step away from\nbeing the strongest Trainer and team!\c\nBut you know what’s funny?\c\nEven though we lost, that was more exciting\nthan any other battle I’ve ever had till now!\c\nEverything’s all mixed up inside me—it was so\nfun and so frustrating, and just...\r\nYup! It was just awesome, really![VAR 0114(0007)]
10	Amazing! You and Hau are both\namazing, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nIt’s like I told you before, the strongest moves\nyou can use are the ones a Trainer and their\r\nPokémon choose together in the heat of the\r\nmoment—when it really counts.\c\nAnd you just proved me right! Congrats, cousin.\nYou’re a Champion we can all be proud of.[VAR 0114(0005)]
11	I told you, didn’t I? Up there on Mount Hokulani.[VAR 0114(0005)]
12	Man, the Pokémon and the Trainers in Alola\nreally are the best!\c\nI want everyone in the world to know that, too!\nThat’s always been my dream![VAR 0114(0005)]
13	And right here, right now, it finally came true!\c\nAnd it’s all thanks to you, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nYou and your [VAR 0101(0001)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
403
0	I’m so happy I got to see that flamin’ hot battle\nhere, right where my dreams came true!\c\nAnd now...[VAR 0114(0005)]
1	[VAR 0100(0000)]!\nFirst-ever Champion of the Alola\r\nPokémon League!\c\nIt’s time we record you and your beloved\npartner’s achievement for eternity![VAR 0114(0005)]
2	[VAR 0100(0000)]!\nFirst-ever Champion of the Alola\r\nPokémon League!\c\nIt’s time we record you and your beloved\nteam’s achievement for eternity![VAR 0114(0005)]
3	[~ 3]
4	You really do love your Pokémon with all your\nheart, don’t you, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0011)]
5	Yup! That’s precisely why [VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]she and h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]iser Pokémon\nwere able to combine that strength to\r\nemerge victorious![VAR 0114(0009)]
6	Now we’re all going to be aiming for your seat.\nI hope you’re ready for some rivals.[VAR 0114(0019)]

9	All right, [VAR 0100(0000)], let’s bust a U-turn\nfor Melemele Island!\c\nWe’re gonna have a big festival in Iki Town!\nDon’t worry, I’ll be sure to let Lillie know, too![VAR 0114(0005)]

2	It’s amazing, isn’t it?\c\nAll these people are here just to help you\ncelebrate this achievement, [VAR 0100(0000)]...[VAR 0114(0006)]
3	Everyone looks so happy...\nThe adults, the children...even the Pokémon![VAR 0114(0006)]
4	It...it hasn’t all been easy...\nbut I’m really glad that I came to Alola![VAR 0114(0006)]
5	Getting to meet you, [VAR 0100(0000)]...\c\nNo...\c\nit wasn’t just meeting you.\nIt was traveling together with you.\c\nI’m so glad I got to be a part of that journey![VAR 0114(0006)]
6	Hey, [VAR 0100(0000)]...\c\nIt looks like the party is going to keep on going\nstrong for some time still, wouldn’t you say?\c\nDo you think...maybe...we could sneak out for\na second and visit the Ruins of Conflict?\c\nI heard from Kahuna Hala that the bridge\nhas been fixed.[VAR 0114(0006)]
7	Sure!
8	What about the festival?
9	I think Tapu Koko must be waiting...\c\nI’m sure it’s waiting for you to come to it,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]...\c\nnow that you finished your island challenge.[VAR 0114(0006)]
10	Really, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nWe should go and tell Tapu Koko properly...\nhow you finished your island challenge![VAR 0114(0006)]
405
0	Now this really takes me back...\c\nBack then I could barely think about anything.\nI was so desperate...[VAR 0114(0006)]
1	But thinking back on it now...\c\nit really was Solgaleo...\c\nI mean it was Nebby who brought the two of us\ntogether, wasn’t it, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0006)]
2	But thinking back on it now...\c\nit really was Lunala...\c\nI mean it was Nebby who brought the two of us\ntogether, wasn’t it, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0006)]
3	Come on! Let’s go![VAR 0114(0006)]
406
0	The Ruins of Conflict...[VAR 0114(0006)]
1	I still wonder why it is that Tapu Koko helped\nus that day...[VAR 0114(0006)]
2	Was it because of some connection to Solgaleo...\nthe Legendary Pokémon of the Alola region?[VAR 0114(0006)]
3	Was it because of some connection to Lunala...\nthe Legendary Pokémon of the Alola region?[VAR 0114(0006)]
407
0	This reminds me of when Hapu became the\nkahuna of Poni Island...[VAR 0114(0006)]
1	My heart is pounding in my chest...\nIs it because of the sacred guardian?\r\nIs Tapu Koko here with us?[VAR 0114(0006)]
408
0	Great Tapu Koko...\c\nit was because of your help that Cosmog lived\nand was able to become Solgaleo.\c\nPlease allow me to thank you on its behalf.\nThank you so very, very much![VAR 0114(0006)]
1	Great Tapu Koko...\c\nIt was because of your help that Cosmog lived\nand was able to become Lunala.\c\nPlease allow me to thank you on its behalf.\nThank you so very, very much![VAR 0114(0006)]
2	It’s your turn next, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0006)]
3	I want to see you show your appreciation in the\nway that only Alola’s Champion could!\c\nI know you can do this, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nI’ll make sure your team is ready, too.[VAR 0114(0006)]
4	[VAR 0100(0000)]! Honestly!\c\nIt’s time you showed Tapu Koko your gratitude.\nDo it through one of the battles that it so loves.[VAR 0114(0006)]
5	You reached out and touched the statue...
6	You seem to hear a voice ringing in your head...\nas though it’s coming from your Z-Power Ring...?
7	GOOD...SOLGALEO...
8	GOOD...LUNALA...
9	IT IS TIME...
10	Tapu ko-ko-ko-kooo!!!
11	Tapu Koko disappeared...
12	A Z-Crystal clattered to the floor at your feet...
13	There is no reaction from the statue...
14	Tapu Koko... It may have lost that battle to you,\nbut I don’t think it was sad about that.\c\nI’m sure that the two of you will meet in battle\nagain someday![VAR 0114(0006)]
15	Tapu Koko...\c\nI know it will aspire to ever greater heights at\nyour side from now on, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0006)]
16	So you’ll challenge Tapu Koko another day...\c\nI suppose Trainers must know how to judge the\nstrength of their opponents and must also\r\nunderstand their own limits.[VAR 0114(0006)]
17	The great Tapu Koko...\nIt really is fantastically strong, isn’t it!\r\nNo wonder it is the guardian of all Akala![VAR 0114(0006)]
18	But I’m so glad we could come here.\nIt had been weighing on my heart...[VAR 0114(0006)]
19	Come on, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nWe should get back to the village.\c\nIf we don’t return soon, everyone will realize\nthat we slipped away from the festival![VAR 0114(0006)]
409
0	Everyone looks like they are having so much fun\nthat I don’t think they even noticed we left...\c\nOh!\nAnd the Battle Royals are about to begin![VAR 0114(0006)]
1	It’s a beautiful festival, isn’t it...\nEveryone looks so happy.[VAR 0114(0006)]
2	I hope that you’ll always stay just the way\nyou are now, [VAR 0100(0000)]...\c\nLook how your joy has brought so much light\nto everyone here...[VAR 0114(0006)]
3	I think even my mother would have smiled and\nlaughed to see this...if she would have come...[VAR 0114(0006)]
4	But she...didn’t think she was in any position to\nmeet you all.[VAR 0114(0006)]
5	She was being very stubborn about it, so I had\nto give her a bit of a scolding about it.\r\nGently, of course.[VAR 0114(0006)]
6	I think...if I could just help her, and everyone,\nfind something to smile about again...[VAR 0114(0006)]
7	[VAR 0100(0000)]...\nI...I am going to—[VAR 0114(0006)]
8	Whoa-ho!
9	Look at this! Everybody’s so fired up. Woo!\c\nWe’ve got the birth of Alola’s strongest ever\nTrainer to celebrate, after all![VAR 0114(0005)]

15	Well...\nit’s true that it’s not the next island or anything.\c\nBut it’s still close enough to visit whenever you\nwant to![VAR 0114(0004)]

17	Your father?[VAR 0114(0004)]
18	Oh, yeah, him. Heh...\c\nHe’s a strong Trainer—real strong, I think.\nBut I guess he really hated being the son of\r\na kahuna and everything, yeah?\r\nSo he works far away from Alola these days.[VAR 0114(0007)]

0	[VAR 0100(0000)]! I’m back!\nAnd I’ll keep on coming back, too!\r\nNo matter how many times it takes.\c\nI’m not giving up until I overcome the obstacle\nthat’s staring me right in the face![VAR 0114(0007)]
1	Man, I really want to be stronger than a kahuna!\c\nBut I still just don’t get how I can do that...\c\nBut if I keep trying and using my full power,\nI think I’ll find the way. That’s how I feel\r\nwhenever I battle against you, [VAR 0100(0000)].\r\nThat’s why I love battling you![VAR 0114(0007)]
2	This is one battle I don’t want to lose...\nNot against you!\c\n[VAR 0101(0001)] and my team are the best,\nand they really want to win, too.\c\nI can’t let them down. I’ve gotta at least do that\nmuch for them if I’m a real Trainer![VAR 0114(0007)]
3	Man, it’s like you’re so close to me but I still\ncan’t reach you, [VAR 0100(0000)]...\r\nI just can’t close the gap between us...\c\nBut I’ll be fine.\nI’ve got [VAR 0101(0001)] and everybody!\c\nYou’d better stay the Champ and wait here\nfor me to come challenge you again someday![VAR 0114(0007)]
4	Phew! It is difficult, triumphing over all the\nElite Four in a row.\c\nHowever, defeating the Champion will\nsurely be even more challenging.[VAR 0114(000B)]
5	We do our utmost as kahunas, always striving\nonward to make a tale worthy of our history.\c\nLooks like you are going to make a fine tale for\nyourself, Champion![VAR 0114(000B)]
6	If I am serious about my role as a kahuna, then\ntaking on the Champion seems fitting![VAR 0114(000B)]
7	We kahunas are chosen by Pokémon.\nAnd the Champion is chosen by the people.\c\nIt brings me some joy to see this new age\ncoming to Alola.[VAR 0114(000B)]
8	What does a Pokémon Trainer really need to be\nsuccessful?\c\nI trained for a long time trying to figure that out.\c\nI guess everyone might have their own answer.\nBut at least for me...\r\nI want the strongest rival for myself.[VAR 0114(0013)]
9	I didn’t beat you, but it was still worth it...\nGoing to train in Kanto, I mean.\c\nAt the very least, I can appreciate your strength\na lot more now than I could’ve before.\c\nThanks, Champ.\nYou’ve helped make us stronger.[VAR 0114(0013)]
10	You just use your best moves and see who is\nleft standing at the end, right?[VAR 0114(0013)]
11	Phew... I’ll be back again.\nYou can count on that, Champion![VAR 0114(0013)]
12	Champion... Now that is a title that everyone\nin Alola would bow before!\c\nI’m already a champion when it comes to power\nand prestige, after all...\r\nTaking this title would be my just deserts![VAR 0114(0015)]
13	I admit you have potential...\c\nYou have proved to me that my judgment of\nyou when we first met was flawless, as usual.\c\nYou are a worthy Champion![VAR 0114(0015)]
14	As long as you claim that title, I will keep\nclawing my way here to you!\c\nThat’s right! I’m here to relieve you of the\ntitle of Pokémon League Champion![VAR 0114(0015)]
15	You wait...\nSomeday I will claw my way back up here again...\c\nbut I suppose I should congratulate you first!\c\nSee how bighearted I am to praise my opponent![VAR 0114(0015)]
16	The name’s Ryuki. I’m what you might call a star.\c\nI mean, with partners like my Pokémon, how\ncould I not be a star?\c\nI came all the way across the sea here to Alola\nto spread my fame out here, too! The whole\r\nworld will be mine soon![VAR 0114(001A)]
17	Everyone’s got their own problems, huh?\c\nThe critics loved my songs, but nobody was\nbuying my music for a while, man.\c\nBut I’m just a rocker down to my bones.\nNothing else to do but keep on rocking.\c\nI dig you, Champ. Looks like you know who\nyou are, too, right down to your bones.[VAR 0114(001A)]
18	My babies here are dying to play a set.\nI figure what better stage than the Champion’s!\c\nAllow me to introduce my bandmates!\nCome on, babies![VAR 0114(001A)]
19	Oooh, that Champion’s strength!\nI feel the flames of jealousy burning in my heart!\c\nBut passing through the fire makes me stronger,\nand that’s why I’m a star!\c\nI’ll roll into town again sometime, Champ.\nI’m always looking for a good gig.[VAR 0114(001A)]
20	I came to keep my word about us having a\nbattle next time, as I said after my trial\r\nat the Observatory.[VAR 0114(0010)]
21	You’re great, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nYou understand Pokémon so well and know so\nmuch about Pokémon battles.\c\nI see that thinking up this and that to try to\ndefeat the Champion is the highest form of fun![VAR 0114(0010)]
22	Playing games with Big Mo...\c\nMaintaining Festival Plaza...\c\nChecking the anime I’ve recorded...\c\nThey’re all fun but not the same as a battle with\nyou, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nI worked out a plan with Ilima against you, \n[VAR 0100(0000)], to try to win.[VAR 0114(0010)]
23	You’re way too strong, [VAR 0100(0000)]...\c\n“Ping Totem Pokémon 2.0” is \nrunning smoothly, so next I’m thinking that\c\nI should put together Sophocles’s\nenhanced program.[VAR 0114(0010)]
24	I came to check on what Kukui has built, and...\nthe Pokémon League is fantastic!\c\nIt’s a place that conveys the awesomeness of\nAlola to the world.\c\nAnd in that case, I guess that what’s important\nis what kind of Trainer the Champion is.[VAR 0114(001C)]
25	Just as I’d expect from an acquaintance\nof Kukui’s!\c\nI too am proud that you are the strongest\nPokémon Trainer in Alola!\c\nI’ll try to come hang out again.\c\nPokémon battles with you are more fun than\nany game![VAR 0114(001C)]
26	I gave the captain position to my cousin\nSophocles, but I’m confident in my ability.\c\nMy strength is like that of a supernova![VAR 0114(001C)]
27	Just as I’d expect from the Champion!\c\nIn every situation, you pick the best moves\nand items.\c\nSo I too have to rack my brain in the battle...\nAt some point I want to have a battle with\r\nSophocles and me as a duo versus you and\r\nKukui for all the marbles. Or I guess a\r\nBattle Royal?[VAR 0114(001C)]
28	I don’t really wanna be the Champion of the\nPokémon League I made myself, but there’s\r\nnothing wrong with wanting to take on the\r\nbiggest and baddest Trainer there is, right?\c\nAfter all, I do love my research![VAR 0114(0005)]
29	Whoa! Well, I always knew it would be a\ncrushing defeat.\c\nI’m still glad I got to battle you, Champ. And I’m\nas thankful as I could be that I met you and\r\nyour Pokémon![VAR 0114(0005)]
30	All right, [VAR 0100(0000)], I’m coming at you \nwith all my might. Woo![VAR 0114(0005)]
31	Whoa! Well, I always knew it would be a\ncrushing defeat.\c\nI’m still glad I got to battle you, Champ. And I’m\nas thankful as I could be that I met you and\r\nyour Pokémon![VAR 0114(0005)]
32	Those old dudes Molayne and Nanu somehow\ntalked me into doing this.\c\nI’m starting from scratch as a Pokémon Trainer\nand doing it right this time.\c\nI’ve got a Z-Power Ring now, so I might\nactually be able to live up to their expectations.[VAR 0114(0018)]
33	Even when I give it my all, I’m nothing compared\nto you!\c\nMaybe my Pokémon and I need to go through\nmore together to deepen our friendship.\c\nI’m out of here, Champ.[VAR 0114(0018)]
34	My team and I are battling for all the Pokémon\nwe took out on our way here![VAR 0114(0018)]
35	I failed again...like I always do. I promised\nmyself I wouldn’t! I told myself I would never\r\nfail again!\c\nIt’s all right to feel a little jealous, right?\nHow else am I supposed to get stronger?\c\nMy team and I really did take out so many\nPokémon to make it here![VAR 0114(0018)]
36	Hey, Champion!\nYou’ve gotta recommend a move for me!
37	I trained as much as I could on Route 1...\c\nI went through the whole island challenge to\nget here...\c\nand still!\nMan, the Champion really is something!
38	Champion! I’m gonna serve you up a brutal\nhelping of my Pokémon’s best moves!
39	Well, at least I know you’ll never beat me in how\nmuch we each love our Pokémon, Champion!
40	The Pokémon League...\c\nThey say that being the strongest Pokémon\nTrainer is not enough to become Champion.\c\nSo how about you show me exactly what kind\nof Trainer you are?[VAR 0114(0014)]
41	Caring won’t keep the things you love safe.\c\nBut if you don’t care, if you’re so hard at heart,\nyou may find you have nothing left to protect...\c\nIs that it?\c\nMaybe I can understand Lillie a little better now.[VAR 0114(0014)]
42	As the president of the Aether Foundation,\nand as Lillie’s mother...\c\nI will take you on in battle, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0014)]
43	Strong and yet kind...\c\nNo... Perhaps your strength in fact comes from\nthat kindness.\c\nThank you for battling with me.\nThank you for being Lillie’s friend.[VAR 0114(0014)]
44	Wanna see what destruction looks like?\nHere it is in human form—it’s your boy Guzma![VAR 0114(0017)]
45	Who knows what the Alolan winds will bring?\c\nNext time we meet, I’m counting on you to test\nhow strong I’ve gotten.[VAR 0114(0017)]
46	I felt the winds of Alola blowin’ and got an itch\nto come see you...\c\nYou know the only way I can scratch that\nitch, huh?!\c\nBy destroying you, of course!\nI’m gonna pummel you into little pieces, punk![VAR 0114(0017)]
47	You destroy everything you can reach, kid,\nand when everything—and I mean everything—\r\nis gone, then you’ll finally see it...\r\nThat’s when you’ll see something new.\c\nLater days, Champion.\n’Cause I’ll keep coming around to fight you until\r\nI’ve found something new of my own![VAR 0114(0017)]
419
0	Wh-whoa!
1	Mantine’s skin is way rougher than I imagined!
2	OK, you!\nStay still till I can climb up on you!
420
0	Now we can finally follow after Mother and...
1	M-Mr. Guzma!\nBut you were...
2	Guh!
3	Mother as well?!
4	Y-you children...
5	Run away...
6	That thing...is a monster!
7	Lino...
421
0	Looks like you slept well, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0004)]
1	A-lo-la![VAR 0114(0007)]
2	The salty breeze sang to me and brought me\nhere to you![VAR 0114(0007)]
3	Oooh! And there’s that Kantonian Meowth!\nLook at that shiny coin on your head, kitty-kitty![VAR 0114(0007)]
4	Meow?
5	Meow to you, too![VAR 0114(0007)]
6	Oh, by the way!\c\nThere were some pretty interesting people\nlooking for you, too, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0007)]
7	So, come on, let’s get out there!\c\nThe Champion of Alola doesn’t get to just stay\ninside all day![VAR 0114(0007)]
422
0	Oh, hey there, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Congrats on\nbecoming the Champion![VAR 0114(0037)]
1	I haven’t quite figured out what a Champion is,\nbut you’re very strong, correct?\r\nI have a favor I must ask of you.[VAR 0114(0036)]
2	Ultra Beasts have appeared on Poni Island.[VAR 0114(0036)]
3	They must have come through the Ultra\nWormhole created by Necrozma.[VAR 0114(0036)]
4	And being the Champion means you’re stronger\nthan the island kahuna, right?[VAR 0114(0037)]
5	Hello, [VAR 0100(0000)]. Congratulations on\nbecoming Alola’s first Champion.[VAR 0114(0038)]
6	I heard that the battle against Hau to decide\nthe Champion was quite the spectacle.[VAR 0114(0038)]
7	So, Champion, as they call you, would you be\nso kind as to give us your assistance?[VAR 0114(0039)]
8	Ultra Beasts have appeared in the depths of\nPoni Island. They must have traveled there via\r\nthe Ultra Wormhole created at the altar on Poni.[VAR 0114(0038)]
9	Sadly, we are no match for them... That is why\nwe request your assistance, Champion.[VAR 0114(0039)]
10	Me and [VAR 0101(0001)] are gonna go, too![VAR 0114(0007)]
11	Of course. You are two of the best Trainers in\nall of Alola.[VAR 0114(0036)]
12	We are heading to Poni Island now. Would you\nlike to accompany us?[VAR 0114(0036)]
13	Of course. We’re counting on you, too, Hau.[VAR 0114(0038)]
14	We were planning on heading to Poni Island\nimmediately. Would you care to come along?[VAR 0114(0039)]
15	Of course!
16	I’ll join up later
17	All right! Another trip together![VAR 0114(0037)]
18	Very well. We will meet you both at Poni Grove.[VAR 0114(0036)]
19	Let us go, then![VAR 0114(0038)]
20	We will be waiting for you at Poni Grove.[VAR 0114(0039)]
21	[~ 21]
423
0	[VAR 0100(0000)]!\nOver here![VAR 0114(0007)]
1	If you head into Poni Grove here, there’re Ultra\nBeasts right here in Alola![VAR 0114(0007)]
2	My young friend [VAR 0100(0000)].\nCongratulations on becoming Champion.[VAR 0114(0016)]
3	I have heard that your final battle against\nMaster Hau was quite fiery.[VAR 0114(0016)]
4	And now the two of you will look into the\nmysteries of the Ultra Beasts, is that right?\c\nI will support you however I can.\nI’ve brought you both a little something.[VAR 0114(0016)]
5	My [VAR 0101(0001)] loves malasadas, too!\c\nThanks, Ms. Wicke![VAR 0114(0007)]
6	Young Master Gladion also left something with\nme for you. It is Type: Null.[VAR 0114(0016)]
7	I’ll also entrust you with all of the memory drives\nneeded to change the type of Type: Null’s\r\nEvolution—the Pokémon Silvally.[VAR 0114(0016)]
8	You received a whole stack of memory drives!
9	Type: Null...\c\nIt was being researched as a possible weapon\nto be used to fight the Ultra Beasts, but I think\r\na Trainer like you, [VAR 0100(0000)]...\c\nMaster Gladion thinks you will be able to show\nType: Null that there is much more to this wide\r\nworld than that.[VAR 0114(0016)]
10	Man, that Gladion...\nHe just doesn’t want to let me win, does he?\c\nWhen he gets back from that training of his,\nI’m definitely asking him for a battle![VAR 0114(0007)]
11	But now I’m off to Poni Grove![VAR 0114(0007)]
12	The members of the Ultra Recon Squad were\nalso making for Poni Grove, I believe.[VAR 0114(0016)]
13	But you have so many Pokémon already that\nyou cannot accept Type: Null now.\c\nPlease come collect it when you’re able.\nI will be at Aether Paradise.[VAR 0114(0016)]
424
0	There you are. The Ultra Beasts known as\nBlacephalon are wandering here in Poni Grove.[VAR 0114(0036)]
1	They must be very uneasy being here in a new\nworld. I should know—that’s how I was, too.[VAR 0114(0037)]
2	...I seem to recall your being beside yourself\nwith excitement, Zossie.[VAR 0114(0036)]
3	Moving right along, here are some Beast Balls\nfor you! They’re the same ones you can buy at\r\nAether Paradise, but they gave them to us since\r\nthis is an emergency. Isn’t that nice?[VAR 0114(0037)]
4	For you, too, Hau![VAR 0114(0037)]
5	Thank you very much for coming. The Ultra\nBeasts, now called Stakataka, are lost and\r\nwandering in Poni Grove.[VAR 0114(0038)]
6	It is my guess that they are distraught... They\nmost likely will attack anything they see.[VAR 0114(0039)]
7	Here are some Beast Balls. Normally you would\nhave to buy these at Aether Paradise, but they\r\nwere kind enough to give some to us.[VAR 0114(0038)]
8	For you, too, Hau. Please take these.[VAR 0114(0038)]
9	Hey, thanks! So, if you’re giving us these balls,\ndoes that mean you want us to catch them?[VAR 0114(0007)]
10	We want to gather data that will help us protect\nthe Ultra Beasts. If you would accept the\r\nBlacephalon as your partners, it would be of\r\ngreat assistance to us. Oh, and for the record,\r\nit seems there are at least three Blacephalon.[VAR 0114(0036)]
11	They’re probably nervous, and that makes them\nrowdy! A battle will help them calm down![VAR 0114(0037)]
12	We leave that to you two. All we wish for is that\nthe Stakataka be able to live peacefully.[VAR 0114(0038)]
13	We have learned from what happened with\nNecrozma. We must not try to control these\r\ncreatures but focus on protecting them.\c\nIt would put both ourselves and the Stakataka\nat ease if you would capture them.[VAR 0114(0039)]
14	Sounds good to me! C’mon, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nLet’s go help the Blacephalon![VAR 0114(0007)]
15	Sounds good to me! C’mon, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nLet’s go help the Stakataka![VAR 0114(0007)]
16	Blacephalon!\nCome out, come out, wherever you are![VAR 0114(0007)]
17	Stakataka!\nCome out, come out, wherever you are![VAR 0114(0007)]
18	With our skill level...we won’t be much help in\nresolving anything that might involve a\r\nPokémon battle.[VAR 0114(0036)]
19	Come out, Blacephalon!\nYou want to go home, too, right?[VAR 0114(0037)]
20	Our skills at Pokémon battles are woefully weak.\nWe are not nearly able to take on Ultra Beasts.[VAR 0114(0038)]
21	The Ultra Beast Stakataka is actually composed\nof almost 150 smaller life-forms, which all\r\ncreate one shape. Be wary, Champion.[VAR 0114(0039)]
22	[VAR 0100(0000)]! Over here![VAR 0114(0007)]
23	That Blacephalon was too strong!\nI was nowhere even close to catching it![VAR 0114(0007)]
24	That Stakataka was too strong!\nI was nowhere even close to catching it![VAR 0114(0007)]
25	But it will now likely keep itself hidden for a\nwhile, and it won’t attack other Pokémon.\c\nWe can use this time to gather data and to\nwork with the Aether Foundation to capture it.[VAR 0114(0036)]
26	Hau! [VAR 0100(0000)]! You were both amazing![VAR 0114(0037)]
27	Let’s see... It seems like there are still a few\nBlacephalon wandering around.[VAR 0114(0037)]
28	No matter! It will likely keep a low profile now\nand won’t attack other Pokémon for some time.\c\nWe can use this time to analyze the data we\ngathered and, with the help of the Aether\r\nFoundation, hopefully capture it.[VAR 0114(0039)]
29	Yes... It seems there are still some Stakataka\nwandering about.[VAR 0114(0038)]
30	Gotcha! I’ll be sure to capture one this time and\nhand it over to the Ultra Recon Squad![VAR 0114(0007)]
31	Blacephalon, whe-e-ere are you?[VAR 0114(0007)]
32	Stakataka, whe-e-ere are you?[VAR 0114(0007)]
33	I would like to avoid these Ultra Beasts’\nbecoming a menace to Alola...[VAR 0114(0036)]
34	Anyone would want to go home if they suddenly\nfound themselves in a strange world...[VAR 0114(0037)]
35	I wonder... Would the Stakataka calm down if\nthere were more of their kind around?[VAR 0114(0038)]
36	We must avoid these Ultra Beasts’ becoming a\nthreat to the Alola region...[VAR 0114(0039)]
37	[VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0007)]
38	Hau gave us the Blacephalon he caught![VAR 0114(0037)]
39	This will help us gather data we can use to\nprotect the Ultra Beasts.[VAR 0114(0036)]
40	Perhaps a day will come where the Ultra Beasts\nwill live here in Alola as normal Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0036)]
41	More things for us to research![VAR 0114(0037)]
42	We are grateful for your help. I’m sure we will\nmeet again...[VAR 0114(0036)]
43	We received the Stakataka Hau was able\nto capture.[VAR 0114(0038)]
44	Together with the Aether Foundation, we should\nbe able to gather useful data in order to protect\r\nthe Ultra Beasts.[VAR 0114(0039)]
45	I expected no less from the two who competed\nfor the championship. You’ve helped us resolve\r\nan extremely delicate situation. We thank you.[VAR 0114(0039)]
46	We take our leave now. Until we meet again...[VAR 0114(0038)]
47	Those were some epic battles!\n[VAR 0101(0001)] had a good time, too!\c\nC’mon, [VAR 0100(0000)]. Let’s head home![VAR 0114(0007)]
425
0	All right! I’ve put it off long enough! Now that\n[VAR 0100(0000)] has become the Champion...[VAR 0114(0004)]
1	Meowth! This is it! We’re really, definitely going\nto put away these boxes today![VAR 0114(0004)]
2	Mrowr!
3	Oh, now who could that be?[VAR 0114(0004)]
4	*pant pant* [VAR 0100(0000)]...\nI...I... You’ve got to...[VAR 0114(0010)]
5	Welcome!
6	What’s wrong?
7	Oh, uh, sorry to come barging in like that!\nI was in a hurry, and I just...[VAR 0114(0010)]
8	What do you mean, what’s wrong?! Everything\nis wrong! I don’t know what to do...[VAR 0114(0010)]
9	Oh, are you one of [VAR 0100(0000)]’s friends?\nI’m h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]iser mom. It’s so nice to meet you![VAR 0114(0004)]
10	Mrrow!
11	Eeek! S-S-S-Sorrocles! I mean I’m sophorry!\nI mean I’m sorry! No, I mean I’m Sophocles! I’m\r\na very sorry Sophocles![VAR 0114(0010)]
12	*gasp gasp*...\nSorry... Let me calm down a bit...[VAR 0114(0010)]
13	I...I came because I need your help,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]...[VAR 0114(0010)]
14	A bunch of strange guys appeared out of\nnowhere and...and they took over Festival Plaza![VAR 0114(0010)]
426
0	The space here suddenly became all twisted,\nand then the programming of the Plaza was\r\nrewritten! That’s why the castle looks so...[VAR 0114(0010)]
1	Creepy...
2	Cool!
3	You think? It looks so menacing, like where a\nfinal boss would live... I think it looks kinda cool![VAR 0114(0010)]
4	Oh, you get it, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Yeah, the way\nit’s so dark and menacing... Whoever did this\r\ncertainly has cool tastes in architecture![VAR 0114(0010)]
5	Still, they broke through my impenetrable\nsecurity system, even if they did take\r\nadvantage of a system malfunction. And they’ve\r\ntaken complete control of Festival Plaza...\c\nBe careful—these guys know what\nthey’re doing![VAR 0114(0010)]
6	Please, [VAR 0100(0000)]! You’ve got to help\nme take back Festival Plaza![VAR 0114(0010)]
7	Thanks!\nI knew I could count on you![VAR 0114(0010)]
8	P-please, don’t say that... I really need\nyour help right now, [VAR 0100(0000)]...[VAR 0114(0010)]
9	I’m glad that you’re with me, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nYou’re the Champion, after all![VAR 0114(0010)]
10	W-well... Let’s go then... *gulp*[VAR 0114(0010)]
427
0	Hey, who are you?! Nobody should be able to\nenter [VAR FF00(0001)]Team Rocket’s Castle[VAR FF00(0000)]![VAR 0114(0033)]
1	I-I have admin rights...[VAR 0114(0010)]
2	What?! How dare you try to confuse me with\nyour nerdy language![VAR 0114(0033)]
3	...*ahem* No matter![VAR 0114(0033)]
4	Team Rocket’s Castle is under our control!\nThere’s nothing you can do, whoever you are![VAR 0114(0033)]
5	Ahahahahahahah!\nMuahahahahahahahaha![VAR 0114(0033)]
6	It seems like this group calls itself Team Rocket.\nThey definitely don’t seem like nice people...\c\nI can’t believe I’ve allowed Festival Plaza to be\ntaken over by people like them...[VAR 0114(0010)]
7	Still... He said this castle was under their\ncontrol. What exactly did he mean...?\c\nGive me a sec and I’ll check...[VAR 0114(0010)]
8	I’ve got it, [VAR 0100(0000)]... They have some\nsort of program lock that prevents us from\r\nusing the Pokémon in our party![VAR 0114(0010)]
9	We need to figure out some way to get Team\nRocket out of here, but without using our\r\nown Pokémon...[VAR 0114(0010)]
428
0	So many Trainers come and go through Festival\nPlaza! Taking over this place will let us steal\r\nPokémon from all over Alola![VAR 0114(0033)]
1	The boss took advantage of the distortion\ncaused by the Ultra Wormhole and took over\r\nFestival Plaza![VAR 0114(0033)]
2	Aah, Team Rocket’s Castle! Just look at that\ndesign! Fit to send the whole world into a vortex\r\nof fear and panic![VAR 0114(0033)]
3	We’re in cyberspace, right? I didn’t know it was\nthis realistic...[VAR 0114(0033)]
4	It turns out we can’t use our own Pokémon,\neither. Thank goodness for the Battle Agency.\c\nWe can still use other people’s Pokémon,\nafter all![VAR 0114(0033)]
429
0	Do you have any ideas on how to get\nTeam Rocket out of here, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0010)]
1	The Battle Agency!
2	Other people’s Pokémon!
3	The Battle Agency...? Oh, of course![VAR 0114(0010)]
4	Other people’s Pokémon...? Oh, right, of course![VAR 0114(0010)]
5	If we use the Battle Agency rules, we can use\nother people’s Pokémon to battle! It doesn’t\r\nmatter if we can’t use our own![VAR 0114(0010)]
6	Just a sec...[VAR 0114(0010)]
7	Using my admin rights to access the debug\nfeatures... Rebooting the reception program...[VAR 0114(0010)]
8	I’ve made it so we can use the Battle Agency\nnow, too...[VAR 0114(0010)]
9	I wish there was more I could do...but I can’t\neven access my full admin rights...[VAR 0114(0010)]
10	I need you to defeat Team Rocket using the\nBattle Agency, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nI’ll try and get back complete admin access\nwhile you keep them busy![VAR 0114(0010)]
430
0	It will take more than a hodgepodge party like\nthat to defeat Team Rocket!\c\nMuahahahahahahahahaha!\nMuaaaaahahahahahahaha![VAR 0114(0033)]
1	Don’t give up, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nI know you can do this... Keep trying until\r\nyou defeat them![VAR 0114(0010)]
2	Impossible! This kid...defeated me?![VAR 0114(0033)]
3	That’s unfair! You shouldn’t be able to battle so\neffectively with other people’s Pokémon![VAR 0114(0033)]
4	Bah... Get ’em, guys![VAR 0114(0033)]
5	We can’t let you take back Team Rocket’s\nCastle. The boss’s plans depend on it![VAR 0114(0033)]
6	Just in time...\nFull system restore![VAR 0114(0010)]
7	Target set to Team Rocket... Executing kick from\nFestival Plaza![VAR 0114(0010)]
8	Whew... That was close.\n...Thanks for your help, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0010)]
9	You kept them busy just long enough for me to\nget back full admin access...[VAR 0114(0010)]
10	I’ve used that access to lock out Team Rocket\nfrom Festival Plaza forever![VAR 0114(0010)]
11	I also restored all the features and everything to\nnormal, too.[VAR 0114(0010)]
12	What about the castle?
13	What about the design?
14	I...kinda like what they did with the castle.\nEven though they were our enemies...\r\nI’ll add it as one of the themes.[VAR 0114(0010)]
15	And I’ll set up some boss data that’d be perfect\nfor this kind of castle.[VAR 0114(0010)]
16	Also... This is for you. You helped me out a lot...[VAR 0114(0010)]
17	I’m really glad you came with me,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0010)]
18	Let’s go home...[VAR 0114(0010)]
19	If you want to change the look of the castle,\ntry raising your Festival Plaza Rank![VAR 0114(0010)]
431
0	Mrow!
1	Oh, watch this, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0004)]
2	Meowth picked up a new move recently![VAR 0114(0004)]
3	Merow!
4	Meowth turned on the TV!
5	So graceful! I bet it saw me turn on the TV and\nwanted to try for itself![VAR 0114(0004)]
6	Mrrff.
7	...This just in.
8	The Aether Foundation is holding a press\nconference as we speak, addressing the black\r\nclouds that appeared over Poni Island.
9	We go now to our live coverage at the scene...
432
0	I know that many of you must have heard of the\ndark clouds covering Poni Island on the news...\c\nYou may be feeling concerned now about what\nis going on, but let me put your fears to rest.[VAR 0114(0014)]
1	This phenomenon was caused by a previously\nunknown Pokémon called Necrozma.[VAR 0114(0014)]
2	Necrozma passed through an Ultra Wormhole,\na wormhole that connects different worlds,\r\nand came here to steal Alola’s light.[VAR 0114(0014)]
3	*chatter chatter*... Necrozma...?\nWhat does she mean, steal our light...?
4	There is nothing to be worried about, though.\c\nThanks to the actions of one brave Trainer, the\nthreat has already been dealt with.\c\nAlola will not be swallowed by darkness.[VAR 0114(0014)]
5	*flash flash*
6	The Aether Foundation will conduct extensive\nresearch into the Ultra Wormholes, so that we\r\ncan prevent any such events in the future.[VAR 0114(0014)]
7	To be specific, we will begin by—[VAR 0114(0014)]
8	Wha—?!\nThat hole... How is that possible...?[VAR 0114(0016)]
9	An Ultra Wormhole?\nBut why now?![VAR 0114(0014)]
10	Eek![VAR 0114(0016)]
11	Who...exactly are you, sir?[VAR 0114(0014)]
12	The technology of the Aether Foundation...the\nknowledge of other worlds—[VAR 0114(0030)]
13	it will be very useful to Team Rocket...\nor rather...[VAR 0114(0030)]
14	[VAR FF00(0001)]Team Rainbow Rocket[VAR FF00(0000)]![VAR 0114(0030)]
15	Did he mean to suggest that his people created\nthis Ultra Wormhole intentionally...?\r\nWe will not allow this to go unchecked![VAR 0114(0014)]
16	P-President! Please, come back![VAR 0114(0016)]
17	Hello? Are you seeing this? The sudden turn of\nevents has left the scene in chaos![VAR 0114(004D)]
18	Team Rainbow Rocket...?\nIs this some kind of prank?[VAR 0114(004D)]
433
0	Oh!\nWhat happened to the TV, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0004)]
1	Mreow?
2	Now, I wonder who that is?[VAR 0114(0004)]
3	[VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0006)]
4	Well, Alola, Lillie![VAR 0114(0004)]
5	A-alola, ma’am.\nI’m so sorry to come barging in all of a sudden.[VAR 0114(0006)]
6	I was just watching the news at the professor’s\nlab, and...and—\c\nDid you see it, too, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0006)]
7	I sure did!
8	An Ultra Wormhole!
9	Yes, an Ultra Wormhole opened up in the middle\nof the press conference!\r\nAnd then everything got so confused...[VAR 0114(0006)]
10	Maybe it was some kind of performance...\c\nI’m sure Mother must be fine, but...still...[VAR 0114(0006)]
11	I...I’m going to go see what is happening at\nAether Paradise.[VAR 0114(0006)]
12	I guess...I just wanted to let you know.\nSorry again for disturbing you![VAR 0114(0006)]
13	Oh, did Lillie leave already?\nI thought she came over for a visit![VAR 0114(0004)]
14	She did look worried, though...\nI hope everything is OK.[VAR 0114(0004)]
15	I’m glad that at least I never have to worry\nabout you, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0004)]
434
0	[VAR 0100(0000)]?![VAR 0114(0006)]
1	Oh, everything is a mess!\c\nMother! And Aether Paradise!\nIt’s all... It’s just all so... It’s all gone wrong![VAR 0114(0006)]
2	Are you OK?
3	Calm down
4	I-I’m sorry... I’m just so worried...[VAR 0114(0006)]
5	It’s good to see you again, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nPlease, let me explain the situation.[VAR 0114(0016)]
6	As you may know, the president called a press\nconference to address the black clouds that\r\nengulfed Poni Island, but...[VAR 0114(0016)]
7	An Ultra Wormhole suddenly opened, and a\nmysterious force took over her mansion![VAR 0114(0016)]
8	The culprits call themselves...\nTeam Rainbow Rocket.[VAR 0114(0016)]
9	I’ve heard of Team Rocket before, when I was in\nthe Kanto region... They were an underground\r\ncriminal organization that used Pokémon for\r\ntheir activities. I think this organization has\r\ncome to Alola now...[VAR 0114(0016)]
10	And Mother...\c\nWicke says that Mother has been taken captive\nby this Team Rainbow Rocket![VAR 0114(0006)]
11	I am trying to come up with as many ways to\nsave the president as possible, but...\c\nto be honest, the situation isn’t good. The\nenemy is too powerful, and on top of that we\r\ndon’t even know why they’re interested in the\r\nAether Foundation![VAR 0114(0016)]
12	I...I want to save my mother.\c\nBut we just aren’t strong enough on our own...[VAR 0114(0006)]
13	I know this is a lot to ask, but if you could lend\nus your strength, [VAR 0100(0000)]...[VAR 0114(0006)]
14	Of course!
15	It’s all yours!
16	Oh, thank you so much! I feel so much better,\nknowing you’re on our side, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0006)]
17	I feel so much better now, knowing you and\nNebby are on our side, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0006)]
18	There’s a swarm of Team Rainbow Rocket\nGrunts ahead. Take this—you might need it.[VAR 0114(0016)]
19	Please, be careful, you two![VAR 0114(0016)]
20	Of course![VAR 0114(0006)]
21	I will keep trying to find a way to fight back on\nmy end, too.\c\n...I swear, where has Faba gone to at\na time like this?[VAR 0114(0016)]
435
0	I will use my full power to help my mother!\c\nYou keep moving on ahead, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nI will handle this![VAR 0114(0006)]
1	Anyone who gets in our way must be destroyed!\nEven if you’re just a kid![VAR 0114(0033)]
2	What, more foundation members who haven’t\nlearned their lesson? Ahead is the new HQ for\r\nTeam Rainbow Rocket! Begone, intruders![VAR 0114(0033)]
3	Please, leave this person\nto me...\r\nYou should go on ahead, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0006)]
4	Argh, how was I supposed to know a kid would\nbe so strong?![VAR 0114(0033)]
436
0	[VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0006)]
1	The mansion...it looks like some kind of castle!\c\nIs this also because of the Ultra Wormhole that\nWicke was talking about?[VAR 0114(0006)]
2	Stop right there.[VAR 0114(0030)]
3	Mr. Faba?! \nWh-what are you doing here?[VAR 0114(0006)]
4	I strongly suggest you abandon your efforts to\nthwart Team Rainbow Rocket.[VAR 0114(0015)]
5	What...do you mean by that?[VAR 0114(0006)]
6	If Team Rainbow Rocket takes over Aether\nParadise, the organization will grow far beyond\r\nwhere we are today...and more Pokémon will\r\nbe saved![VAR 0114(0015)]
7	...And if I can assist it in doing so, no doubt my\ncareer will also reach new heights![VAR 0114(0015)]
8	Such a wonderful thought, wouldn’t you agree?[VAR 0114(0015)]
9	Mr. Faba...\nDid...did you...? Y-you wouldn’t...[VAR 0114(0006)]
10	Ah, as astute as ever, Miss Lillie! The same\nintuition that told you to rescue Cosmog still\r\nserves you well, I see.[VAR 0114(0015)]
11	Yes, you guess correctly! I have taken it upon\nmyself to facilitate Team Rainbow Rocket’s\r\ntake-over and ensure everything goes smoothly![VAR 0114(0015)]
12	Mr. Faba, how could you?!\nWe...we trusted you! And you—!\c\nThe Aether Foundation is not some tool for you\nto use to move up in the world![VAR 0114(0006)]
13	You have to make this Team Rainbow Rocket\nstop all this at once![VAR 0114(0006)]
14	...You may be astute, Miss Lillie, but I see you\nare less inclined to listen to reason.[VAR 0114(0015)]
15	Now, even I would be hard-pressed against the\nChampion, especially if Gladion or the grandson\r\nof the kahuna were aiding h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer...[VAR 0114(0015)]
16	But with you tripping h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer up, perhaps it won’t\nbe so difficult for me to win, even against the\r\nChampion! I thank you in advance, Miss Lillie![VAR 0114(0015)]
17	Traveling with [VAR 0100(0000)] has changed\nme, too! I’ll show you my full power![VAR 0114(0006)]
18	...As you will.[VAR 0114(0015)]
19	Then I, Branch Chief Faba, Aether Paradise’s\nlast line of defense, shall show you little\r\nchildren the harshness of the real world![VAR 0114(0015)]
20	Hmph! I’ll have you know defeating me won’t do\nyou any good, anyway.[VAR 0114(0015)]
21	The Ultra Wormhole has resonated with the\nboss’s ideology and has gathered the toughest,\r\nmeanest villains from many other worlds![VAR 0114(0015)]
22	...Although, for now, they seem content just to\ndo whatever research they wish, using the\r\ntechnology of Aether Paradise...[VAR 0114(0015)]
23	Now, I hope you enjoy your futile efforts![VAR 0114(0015)]
24	Come on, [VAR 0100(0000)]...\nLet’s move on.[VAR 0114(0006)]
437
0	Not even this room!\nI had so many memories in this room...[VAR 0114(0006)]
1	I want to check out the rest of the mansion, but\nthe door hidden behind the mirror won’t open...[VAR 0114(0006)]
2	Let’s go back to the entrance and see if we can\nfind another way.[VAR 0114(0006)]
438
0	Intruders![VAR 0114(0031)]
1	You’ll be sorry you messed with Team Rainbow\nRocket... Also known as Team RR![VAR 0114(0032)]
2	Eeek![VAR 0114(0006)]
3	W-wait one moment...\nMy legs started shaking, and they won’t stop...[VAR 0114(0006)]
4	Heh heh heh... Now who in the world waits\njust because an intruder asked them to?[VAR 0114(0031)]
5	Mmm, such a pretty princess! Don’t worry, we’re\ngoing to obliterate you nice and proper![VAR 0114(0032)]
6	Hey, you punks![VAR 0114(0030)]
7	M-Mr. Guzma?![VAR 0114(0006)]
8	The hated boss who beats you down, and beats\nyou down, and never lets up...\r\nYeah. Big bad Guzma is here![VAR 0114(0017)]
9	Hey, I know you... You’re the boss of that\npathetic group that got disbanded—Team Skull!\c\nI wouldn’t expect much from just an Alolan thug.[VAR 0114(0031)]
10	No vision, no ideals... What does such a\nworthless punk want at Team Rocket’s Castle?[VAR 0114(0032)]
11	Heh... I gotta admit... You got me all figured out![VAR 0114(0017)]
12	I got nothin’... Not even my team\nanymore. I’m just another regular nobody...[VAR 0114(0017)]
13	But! I still got some things I can’t let go...\nThings ain’t nobody gonna mess with![VAR 0114(0017)]
14	And guess what? You punks just messed with\none of those things! I can’t let that slide...[VAR 0114(0017)]
15	Hey, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nGimme a hand here![VAR 0114(0017)]
16	What?! We’re Team RR! We’re not supposed to\nlose to a kid and a punk![VAR 0114(0031)]
17	They...they won’t be obliterated![VAR 0114(0032)]
18	Thank you for helping us, Mr. Guzma![VAR 0114(0006)]
19	I just beat down the goons who were gettin’\non my nerves, that’s all.[VAR 0114(0017)]
20	Now, what’re you standin’ around for? You got\na score to settle, too, don’t you?![VAR 0114(0017)]
21	Yes, we do![VAR 0114(0006)]
22	I got your back! I’ll be right here, and no one’s\ngettin’ through![VAR 0114(0017)]
23	Here, let me heal your Pokémon for you.[VAR 0114(0006)]
24	Here, let me heal your Pokémon for you.[VAR 0114(0006)]
25	I guess I’m still not strong enough as a Trainer...\nI’ll focus on healing your Pokémon for now.\c\nIf your Pokémon need help, come to the room in\nthe back![VAR 0114(0006)]
26	I may not be very good at Pokémon battles, but\nI know a thing or two about Pokémon healing![VAR 0114(0006)]

2	Prepare for an interruption! Let’s see how good\nyour memory is!
3	...Or, well, I WOULD interrupt if my Pokémon\nwere still healthy.
4	We’re no good at remembering patterns. We just\nwanted to make someone else feel the same!
5	... ... ...\n... ... ...
6	And another interruption! How’s your focus\nholding out?
7	...Or at least I’d try to interrupt if my Pokémon\ncould still fight!
8	We’re annoying, right? I know, I know...\nWe’re just doing our job, though.
9	You got past the glowing floor puzzles?!\nWell, you won’t get any farther!
10	The boss of Team...what’s-it-called is in this\nroom! Of course, our boss is way more amazing!
11	You’ve got brains and Pokémon brawn!\nLet’s see how far they’ll get you!
12	I like our boss, obviously, but the man in here\nalso seems really smart... I kind of like him!
13	It’s confusing, right? I know how you feel!
14	Heh heh heh... You messed up! You should give\nup already!
15	You made a mistake, just as we’d planned!
16	I’m just a plain old Grunt, hangin’ out here.\nDon’t mind me! Go on, solve the puzzle!
17	Now’s my chance! Check out my awesomely\ndistracting pose!

1	All this ruckus was caused by a child?[VAR 0114(0030)]
2	I am Team Magma’s Maxie.[VAR 0114(0021)]
3	I had finally realized my grand design, only to be\nswallowed by a great fissure that appeared\r\nbeneath me... When I awoke, I was in this world.[VAR 0114(0021)]
4	I’m enjoying this experience so far, though.\nThe knowledge in this world is...fascinating.[VAR 0114(0021)]
5	I do intend to return to my own world eventually,\nbut first...[VAR 0114(0021)]
6	I have decided to bring my grand design to this\nworld, as well![VAR 0114(0021)]
7	I will use the magma-controlling power of the\nContinent Pokémon Groudon to shrink the\r\noceans and create more glorious landmass![VAR 0114(0021)]
8	With more dry land to live on, the creatures of\nthe land will no longer have to fight for territory![VAR 0114(0021)]
9	This is the ideal world for people and Pokémon!\nA world without conflict! Don’t you agree?[VAR 0114(0021)]
10	Do you mean to interfere with my plans?\nYou are just like that fool from Team Aqua.[VAR 0114(0021)]
11	I can’t allow an ignorant child like you to get in\nour way. I, Maxie, will show you the\r\nconsequences of meddling![VAR 0114(0021)]
12	So you defeated the master of the land—\nthe great Maxie! Still, I wonder...\c\nWhat makes you so adept at handling Pokémon?[VAR 0114(0021)]
13	There has to be some reason I was defeated...\nThat’s what you’re trying to say, aren’t you?\c\n... ... ...\n... ... ...\c\nHmph... You think I didn’t know that? This isn’t\nmy own world, after all.[VAR 0114(0021)]
14	If you truly wish to continue farther into Team\nRocket’s Castle, there are two paintings that\r\nyou will need to examine.\c\nOne red, and the other blue.[VAR 0114(0021)]
15	I have my noble cause! To expand the\nlandmass, for the advancement of humankind\r\nand Pokémon! This is where we part![VAR 0114(0021)]

15	None shall pass!
16	I hope this is worth the trouble!
17	If we let you through, we get our\npay docked!
18	Please, just go home!
19	The realization of Team RR’s grand plan is\nresting on our shoulders!
20	So you got through the Grunt walls, did you?
21	Nothing unexpected! Let’s do this, just as\nwe planned!
22	Brace yourself! Hyaaaaa...
23	Huh? I thought this was supposed to be a\npincer attack! Why am I all alone?!
24	Blast, our plan has failed! No matter, I’ll stop you\nby myself!
25	Seriously though, where did the others go?\nI hope they’re not lost somewhere...
26	Oh, hey... Well, this is awkward...\nUh, do you think you could still battle me?
27	We were all ready to ambush you, and I had to\nstep on a warp panel. It’s a shame an Escape\r\nRope doesn’t let you escape embarrassment...
28	Well, that was embarrassing...\nI still am going to battle you, though.
29	Nothing goes well for me working as a Grunt.\n...Maybe I should just go home and live with\r\nmy parents.
30	I’ll stop you right here! No need for my\nsupervisor here to worry himself!
31	If you’re good enough to defeat my supervisor,\nit’s not surprising I couldn’t beat you.
32	Let me show my underling how it’s done!
33	The boss in this room here, he’s almost like\neveryone’s older brother. He has a way of just...\r\npulling everyone around him together, y’know?
442
0	Hm, what’s this? You defeated the Team RR\ngoons, did you now?[VAR 0114(0030)]
1	Well, that’s a shame. They weren’t my real crew,\nbut they were still mine for the moment.[VAR 0114(0030)]
2	...The name’s Archie.\nI’m the leader of Team Aqua.[VAR 0114(0022)]
3	Just when I completed my great plan, I got\nswallowed up by a giant wave...\c\nAnd when I came ’round, I was in this world.[VAR 0114(0022)]
4	The boss of Team RR was kind enough to let\nme use this room as my own.\c\nI’ve been tryin’ to figure out a way to get back\nto my own home.[VAR 0114(0022)]
5	And I do want to go back eventually, but I find\nmyself thinkin’...[VAR 0114(0022)]
6	maybe I should make this world more like my\nideal while I’m here anyway![VAR 0114(0022)]
7	I’ve got the Sea Basin Pokémon, Kyogre...\nWith its power to control the rains, I’ll call down\r\na great deluge to wash away this world’s land![VAR 0114(0022)]
8	All life is born from the sea! If we help the\nocean expand, we’re creating the cradle for\r\nfuture life to grow and thrive![VAR 0114(0022)]
9	The best possible future for both people and\nPokémon, don’t you think?![VAR 0114(0022)]
10	Oh? So you want to get in my way, just like that\nbuffoon from Team Magma.[VAR 0114(0022)]
11	Well then, you little scamp...\nIt’s the rope’s end for you and your Pokémon![VAR 0114(0022)]
12	Well, would you look at that!\c\nI control the ocean and all its power, and yet\nhere I am, beaten by a little tyke![VAR 0114(0022)]
13	All right, all right... You’ve made your point.\nI can see you’re not one to be trifled with.[VAR 0114(0022)]
14	If you want to get farther into Team Rocket’s\nCastle, though, you’d better have checked out\r\nthe pictures hanging on the walls.\c\nThe red one, and the blue one, too.[VAR 0114(0022)]
15	It makes me wonder... If there was a Trainer like\nyou back in my old world, would I have ever\r\nbeen able to pull off my great dream?[VAR 0114(0022)]
16	A switch behind the painting!?\nShould you push it?
17	Let’s push it!
18	The switch has already been pressed!
443
0	Hey! You found the prez yet?[VAR 0114(0017)]
1	Not yet
2	You all right there?
3	Ugh! C’mon, you Grunts! Tell me where the prez\nis, or else![VAR 0114(0017)]
4	Oh, you’re still wandering around here?[VAR 0114(0021)]
5	You better hurry, little tyke, or what you’re\nlookin’ for will be gone forever![VAR 0114(0022)]
6	Who are you two weirdos? And whaddya mean,\ngone forever?![VAR 0114(0017)]
7	Well, if it isn’t the big buffoon himself, Archie![VAR 0114(0021)]
8	Hey, careful who you call names, Maxie! I seem\nto recall you cowering in defeat in front of me![VAR 0114(0022)]
9	Hmph, such nonsense. No matter what world\nwe’re in, I would never lose to the likes of you.[VAR 0114(0021)]
10	Ooh, you want me to prove it to you then?\nC’mon, let’s settle this, right here, right now![VAR 0114(0022)]
11	As you wish! Let the victor take Alola, and do\nwith it as he pleases![VAR 0114(0021)]
12	Agreed![VAR 0114(0022)]
13	H-hey! What’re y’all talkin’ about? This isn’t\nyour turf![VAR 0114(0017)]
14	Hm...?![VAR 0114(0021)]
15	Wh-what’s this?![VAR 0114(0022)]
16	Huh?! What’s goin’ on here...[VAR 0114(0017)]
17	Yo, I got these goons! You head upstairs![VAR 0114(0017)]
18	*pant pant* We’re not going to...tell\nyou anything![VAR 0114(0031)]
19	Even if we did, you wouldn’t be able to reach\nher, anyway! *gasp gasp*\c\nI...I can’t breathe if you cover my face like that![VAR 0114(0032)]
20	*wheeze wheeze* He’s right! If you want to get\npast the mirror, you’ll need to get to the second\r\nfloor, find the card key, and activate the switch!\r\nYou’ll never be able to do it![VAR 0114(0031)]
21	Hahahahahahahahaha!\nMuahahahahahahahahahaha...hah...hah...\r\n*gasp gasp* I...I still can’t breathe...[VAR 0114(0032)]
22	...I might not be one to talk, but these dudes\nare stupid![VAR 0114(0017)]
23	*pant pant* I...can’t see...\ncan’t...throw...my Poké Balls...[VAR 0114(0031)]
24	Please... Please just... *gasp gasp*\nLet us have a...Pokémon battle...[VAR 0114(0032)]
25	If you got time to just stand there chillin’, hurry\nup and get to the prez! Don’t worry—anyone\r\nwho comes through here is gettin’ a beatdown![VAR 0114(0017)]
26	*gasp gasp wheeze* Please...let me...just...\nLet me throw my Poké Ball...[VAR 0114(0031)]
27	*gasp choke* Can’t...take...much more...\nHave mercy...please...[VAR 0114(0032)]
444
0	[~ 0]
1	All that spinning around must have worn you\nout! Now, let’s have a battle, fair and square!
2	All right, you can go through! It’s not like we’re\nprotecting our real boss, anyway.
3	Here’s another battle in a row, just to wear you\ndown even more!
4	The only one in that room is a creepy,\nantisocial guy, you know?
445
0	Who are you...?[VAR 0114(0030)]
1	It seems you are not a member of Team RR.[VAR 0114(0030)]
2	...My name is Cyrus.[VAR 0114(0023)]
3	I would like to ask you one question.[VAR 0114(0023)]
4	Is this world the new world?[VAR 0114(0023)]
5	Maybe?
6	I don’t know
7	I can sense in you the strong desire to protect...\nsomething. You have a powerful spirit.[VAR 0114(0023)]
8	...That must mean this isn’t the world I desired.[VAR 0114(0023)]
9	I used the power of the Pokémon that control\ntime and space to create a perfect world,\r\nwhere the human spirit does not exist.[VAR 0114(0023)]
10	That was when a great shadow appeared and\nengulfed me... And brought me to this world.[VAR 0114(0023)]
11	Is that a Pokédex...? May I have a look?[VAR 0114(0023)]
12	Zzzt?[VAR 0114(0035)]
13	Interesting... In this world, even the Pokédex is...[VAR 0114(0023)]
14	The Rotom Dex wazzz made to help Trainerzzz![VAR 0114(0035)]
15	... ... ...\n... ... ...[VAR 0114(0023)]
16	...I see. So you have a spirit, as well.[VAR 0114(0023)]
17	But it’s too late... All too late. I cannot stop now.[VAR 0114(0023)]
18	I must remove the weak, incomplete human\nspirit from this world and bring it perfection![VAR 0114(0023)]
19	How foolish...[VAR 0114(0023)]
20	I will not let anyone get in my way...[VAR 0114(0023)]
21	...Why are you able to create such strong bonds\nwith your Pokémon?[VAR 0114(0023)]
22	And how are you able to turn those bonds\ninto strength?[VAR 0114(0023)]
23	Don’t you get it?\n[VAR 0100(0000)] izz kind to all Pokémon![VAR 0114(0035)]
24	...I see.[VAR 0114(0023)]
25	...You need not worry, Rotom. I will not do\nanything to this world. I believe I shall return to\r\nthe perfect world I created.[VAR 0114(0023)]
26	But before that...take this key.[VAR 0114(0023)]
27	Use it to activate the machine on the wall\nbehind me. That should open the mirror door.[VAR 0114(0023)]
28	Had I met you sooner...would things have been\ndifferent for me...?[VAR 0114(0023)]
29	Do you want to use the Galactic Key?
30	Let’s use it!
31	The machine has already been activated!
32	The Galactic Key broke...
446
0	The Meowth statue is looking straight ahead.
1	There is a button on the back of the Meowth\nstatue. Would you like to press the button?
2	Let’s push it!
3	BEEP! BEEP!\nIntruder alert! Intruder alert!
4	You’re back at the entrance...
5	You may have been able to get past the\nMeowth statues, but you can’t get past me!
6	The man in the room here made us bring in two\nhuge switches. I wonder what they’re for?
7	Yeesh! You should just turn 360 degrees and\nget out of here!
8	How do the Meowth statues send you back to\nthe entrance of the room, anyway?
447
0	You must be the intruder I keep hearing about.[VAR 0114(0030)]
1	I am Lysandre.[VAR 0114(0025)]
2	I had triggered my ultimate weapon to wipe out\nall the fools—everyone except Team Flare...\c\nBut at that moment, a bright light swallowed me\nand I wandered into this world.[VAR 0114(0025)]
3	No matter. My purpose remains the same.\nWhich world I’m in is not important.\c\nThe only way to create a world where people\nlive in beauty, a world without conflict or theft...[VAR 0114(0025)]
4	Behind me, you see two buttons.[VAR 0114(0025)]
5	One will open the path for you, and help you\nmove forward...[VAR 0114(0025)]
6	The other will trigger my ultimate weapon, and\ndestroy all that there is in this world![VAR 0114(0025)]
7	...So, make your choice.\c\nI believe being a chosen one means you have\nthe potential to change the future! Whether we\r\nactivate the ultimate weapon or leave it safely\r\nunderground will rest upon if you actually have\r\nthis potential or not.[VAR 0114(0025)]
8	Do you want to press the blue button?
9	You pressed the blue button!
10	Do you want to press the red button?
11	You pressed the red button!
12	The button has already been pressed.
13	... ... ...\n... ... ...[VAR 0114(0025)]
14	Unfortunately... You are not a chosen one![VAR 0114(0025)]
15	You will destroy the world you tried to protect,\nby your own hand![VAR 0114(0025)]
16	However... There is still time before my ultimate\nweapon is fully activated.[VAR 0114(0025)]
17	Press the other button before it fires, and you\nwill be able to stop it.[VAR 0114(0025)]
18	...Of course, I refuse to allow that. So, I will keep\nyou busy for a moment.[VAR 0114(0025)]
19	The future you want, or the future I want...[VAR 0114(0025)]
20	Let us see which one is more deserving,\nshall we?[VAR 0114(0025)]
21	The strength to protect, huh?\n...Very well. Go on, press the button.[VAR 0114(0025)]
22	You have stopped my ultimate weapon, and also\nyou have taken one step more toward your goal.[VAR 0114(0025)]
23	Maybe...if my world had a Trainer like you, the\npath I chose could have been different...\r\nNo! Nothing can change me now! If there is a\r\npath to creating a beautiful world, then that is\r\nthe path I must take! Even if it means I can only\r\nsave a handful of the old world![VAR 0114(0025)]
448
0	[VAR 0100(0000)], look![VAR 0114(0006)]
1	The hidden door behind the mirror is unlocked,\nand now we can use the warp panel![VAR 0114(0006)]
2	I knew you could do it, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nHere, let me heal your Pokémon first...[VAR 0114(0006)]
3	Now, let’s go![VAR 0114(0006)]
4	Well now, what do we have here...?\nI come out wondering what the commotion is...[VAR 0114(0030)]
5	only to find the door to the center of the castle\najar, and intruders running wild!\c\nIt seems those team leaders from other worlds\nare not nearly as useful as I had hoped.[VAR 0114(0030)]
6	Who are you?! Where is my mother?!\nYou haven’t harmed her, have you?![VAR 0114(0006)]
7	Mother, you say...? I see, you’re the daughter of\nthe president.[VAR 0114(0030)]
8	My name is Ghetsis.\nI am representing Team Plasma.[VAR 0114(0024)]
9	I, too, was summoned from another world, much\nlike the other leaders you’ve defeated![VAR 0114(0024)]
10	There is no need to worry.\c\nYou will find the president up ahead, blissfully\nasleep and dreaming.[VAR 0114(0024)]
11	Mother![VAR 0114(0006)]
12	Ah, not so fast![VAR 0114(0024)]
13	Please get out of my way![VAR 0114(0006)]
14	Unfortunately, I cannot let you go beyond\nthis point![VAR 0114(0024)]
15	You see, I have been thinking long and hard\nabout the reason I have been sent to this world.\c\nAnd now...I believe I finally have the answer![VAR 0114(0024)]
16	My purpose... It is to travel between the worlds,\nfreeing all Pokémon from foolish people...\c\nAnd at the same time, consolidate all the power\nin all the worlds to myself![VAR 0114(0024)]
17	In order to achieve this beautiful ideal, however,\nI have need of a useful pawn...[VAR 0114(0024)]
18	And that man, the leader of Team Rocket, is a\nman of pure evil![VAR 0114(0024)]
19	If I can make good use of him, and set him up as\na king, I shall be able to reign supreme above\r\nall existence![VAR 0114(0024)]
20	I have found that humans, with their predictable\nambitions, are easier to use and control than\r\na freak without a human heart.[VAR 0114(0024)]
21	It wouldn’t do at all to have you get in his way,\nespecially when I must establish him as my king![VAR 0114(0024)]
22	Must you insist on interfering with my plans?[VAR 0114(0024)]
23	Very well, then... All obstacles to my ambitions\nmust be removed![VAR 0114(0024)]
24	What?![VAR 0114(0024)]
25	I created Team Plasma with my own hands.\nI’m absolutely perfect! I AM PERFECTION!\c\nI am the perfect ruler of a perfect new world![VAR 0114(0024)]
26	You lost.\nNow please, step aside![VAR 0114(0006)]
27	This cannot be possible... I will not accept this![VAR 0114(0024)]
28	Aaaugh![VAR 0114(0006)]
29	Myah-ha-ha! No, no, no, no, no! You don’t get\nit, do you? I can’t be defeated! I won’t be!\c\nIT. CANNOT. BE. ALLOWED![VAR 0114(0024)]
30	You, tiny intruder! If you value this girl’s life,\nthrow aside all your Poké Balls, at this moment![VAR 0114(0024)]
31	Y-you cowardly...[VAR 0114(0006)]
32	[VAR 0100(0000)], please!\nDon’t listen to him![VAR 0114(0006)]
33	Shut your mouth![VAR 0114(0024)]
34	What’s this? Your Poké Balls are shaking! Could\nit be that they’re shaking with rage?\c\nNo matter! Throw away all your Poké Balls, right\nthis instant![VAR 0114(0024)]
35	All right...
36	I refuse!
37	Myah-ha-ha-ha! Good, good... That’s a good\nlittle [VAR 1100(00FF,0403)]boygirl. Do as your elders command you!\c\nVictory only suits perfect leaders, after all...\nSuch as myself![VAR 0114(0024)]
38	Were you not listening, or did you simply not\nunderstand? Well, you leave me no choice.\r\nThis girl must...[VAR 0114(0024)]
39	I see you are still dedicated to your own\ndesires, Ghetsis...[VAR 0114(002B)]
40	Y-you![VAR 0114(0024)]
41	It has been a while.[VAR 0114(002B)]
42	Miss Lillie, it is good to see you again. We ran\ninto each other in the lab, perhaps you recall?[VAR 0114(002B)]
43	Mr. Colress...?[VAR 0114(0006)]
44	And you, [VAR 0100(0000)]. We meet again![VAR 0114(002B)]
45	Ms. Wicke had sent word that you may need\nassistance. You’ll have to forgive my\r\nrudeness, but I followed your trail using an\r\ninvisibility device I recently invented.[VAR 0114(002B)]
46	It seems Ghetsis here has caused you quite\nsome trouble![VAR 0114(002B)]
47	Although it appears this Ghetsis is from a\ndifferent world than the one I know.[VAR 0114(002B)]
48	Of course... The Colress of this world! But you\nshould have no reason to meddle in my plans![VAR 0114(0024)]
49	Oh, please...[VAR 0114(002B)]
50	I simply despise you, Ghetsis. That’s enough\nreason for me![VAR 0114(002B)]
51	What’s this...? My body is being pulled...[VAR 0114(0024)]
52	No...NOOOOOOOOOOOO![VAR 0114(0024)]
53	It seems like repeated use is not a problem,\neven with the prototype. I should have known\r\nColress Machine No. 1102 would work![VAR 0114(002B)]
54	Thank you for helping us, Mr. Colress![VAR 0114(0006)]
55	But what did you do to that man?[VAR 0114(0006)]
56	I simply adjusted his dimensional “channel,” if\nyou will, and sent him back to his original world![VAR 0114(002B)]
57	But Ghetsis is a man with power to match his\nambition! He is not someone to be taken lightly.\c\nI can only hope that the taste of defeat will\nkeep that Ghetsis out of trouble in his world...[VAR 0114(002B)]
58	Y-yes...[VAR 0114(0006)]
59	But turning Aether Paradise back to its original\nform...[VAR 0114(002B)]
60	With all the different worlds mixing together,\nthat won’t be easy, even for me![VAR 0114(002B)]
61	There is tremendous power of evil at the center\nof the castle... If we can remove that man’s\r\ntwisted desires, the Colress Machine should be\r\nable to revert everything back to normal...[VAR 0114(002B)]
62	You mean Team Rocket’s boss? If we can do\nsomething about him, everything will be fixed...?[VAR 0114(0006)]
63	Indeed, Miss Lillie! You are a very sharp\nyoung lady![VAR 0114(002B)]
64	I would like to study this castle, however, so I\nleave the rest to you two![VAR 0114(002B)]
65	This castle... Oh, of course! Necrozma’s power\nto open Ultra Wormholes overflowed and\r\nresonated with intent of tremendous evil,\r\ntwisting reality and causing this to appear![VAR 0114(002B)]
66	The vortex of power somehow...summoned the\nevil leaders, such as Ghetsis, from their worlds![VAR 0114(002B)]
67	It’s all very interesting... Ah, I mean, quite a pain.\nI could put this power to much better use![VAR 0114(002B)]
449
0	Mother![VAR 0114(0006)]
1	Well, well...[VAR 0114(0030)]
2	I had been informed of the intruders, but not\nthat they were kids like you![VAR 0114(0030)]
3	I had allowed the other bosses to do as they\nwished, hoping they would be of use...\c\nBut it seems you have defeated all of them.[VAR 0114(0030)]
4	I am impressed you got here.[VAR 0114(0030)]
5	So you... You’re Team Rainbow Rocket’s—[VAR 0114(0006)]
6	Indeed![VAR 0114(0030)]
7	Team Rocket’s goal was to use all the Pokémon\nand control the world. But now, I have a bigger,\r\nbetter organization. Team Rainbow Rocket![VAR 0114(0030)]
8	And I, Giovanni, am its leader![VAR 0114(0020)]
9	Mother! Are you OK?! Mother, please answer![VAR 0114(0006)]
10	The president will not awaken for some time.[VAR 0114(0020)]
11	I have used the power of that Ultra Beast to\nmake her sleep...[VAR 0114(0020)]
12	And when she awakens next, she will be a loyal\nservant to my will![VAR 0114(0020)]
13	What?!\nHow...how could you?[VAR 0114(0006)]
14	Team Rainbow Rocket will conquer all worlds!\nWe will build an army of UBs![VAR 0114(0020)]
15	But in order for this precious dream to be\nrealized, we need the technology of the Aether\r\nFoundation—the technology of other worlds![VAR 0114(0020)]
16	...But I also appreciate the skill it took you to get\nthis far.[VAR 0114(0020)]
17	I like those who show strength! Why not\nput that strength to good use, in my\r\nTeam Rainbow Rocket?[VAR 0114(0020)]
18	Hah! You are calm enough to joke, I see.[VAR 0114(0020)]
19	Ha! Of course that would be your answer.[VAR 0114(0020)]
20	Having a kid stand in front of me like this...\nSuch a thing should never happen. But for some\r\nreason, it also makes me feel nostalgic.[VAR 0114(0020)]
21	If you insist on disrupting my plans, I will make\nyou feel a world of pain![VAR 0114(0020)]
22	...I see you have raised your Pokémon with\nutmost care.[VAR 0114(0020)]
23	It would be foolish to fight such a kid with all\nmy might.[VAR 0114(0020)]
24	Ha, very well. I will leave Aether Paradise in\nyour hands.[VAR 0114(0020)]
25	But remember, my Team Rainbow Rocket will\nnever fail![VAR 0114(0020)]
26	Never forget that![VAR 0114(0020)]
27	I shall step aside this time! I hope we\nmeet again...[VAR 0114(0020)]
450
0	The castle... It’s gone...[VAR 0114(0006)]
1	The Colress Machine has been activated, and it\nrestored the mansion to its original form...\r\nWhich means...you’ve done it!\r\nYou defeated Team Rocket![VAR 0114(002B)]
2	Mr. Colress! And Mr. Guzma![VAR 0114(0006)]
3	Took you long enough![VAR 0114(0017)]
4	For a Trainer such as you, who can bring out\nPokémon’s power through your bonds, it must\r\nhave been easy.[VAR 0114(002B)]
5	The defeat of Team Rocket’s boss seems to\nhave sent everyone who had come with him\r\nback to their own worlds.[VAR 0114(002B)]
6	As for me... I have decided on the next theme\nof my research![VAR 0114(002B)]
7	Well then, I hope to see you again sometime.[VAR 0114(002B)]
8	Mr. Colress...\nHe’s a truly great scientist, isn’t he?\r\nThough he is also so very strange...[VAR 0114(0006)]

10	Madam Prez![VAR 0114(0017)]
11	Mother![VAR 0114(0006)]
12	[VAR 0100(0000)] defeated Team Rocket for us![VAR 0114(0006)]
13	What! [VAR 1100(00FF,0201)]HShe did?!\nIt must have been terribly dangerous...[VAR 0114(0014)]
14	[VAR 1100(00FF,0201)]HShe did! It was really amazing![VAR 0114(0006)]
15	Well, [VAR 0100(0000)], it seems you’ve saved\nthe day once again.[VAR 0114(0014)]
16	I am truly grateful.[VAR 0114(0014)]
17	Mr. Faba![VAR 0114(0006)]
18	Buagh![VAR 0114(0015)]

20	I still feel a bit dizzy, but...\c\nWhat of you, Faba?\nAre you unhurt?[VAR 0114(0014)]
21	Oh, yes, of course! No need to worry yourself\nabout me, President! I’m just glad you’re safe![VAR 0114(0015)]
22	Mother! Mr. Faba was—[VAR 0114(0006)]
23	N-now, now, Miss Lillie! You must still be rattled\nfrom all the confusion and chaos caused by\r\nTeam Rainbow Rocket![VAR 0114(0015)]
24	I would never do such a thing as betray the\nfoundation and invite Team Rainbow Rocket in,\r\njust to advance my career![VAR 0114(0015)]
25	Branch Chief Faba.[VAR 0114(0014)]
26	... ... ...[VAR 0114(0015)]
27	I...[VAR 0114(0015)]

451
0	Oh, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Thank you very much for\nyour assistance in saving Aether Paradise![VAR 0114(0016)]
1	Mother is in the medical room now...\nThey’re running some checks, but it seems she\r\nis going to be fine.[VAR 0114(0006)]
2	Oh, and about Mr. Faba...[VAR 0114(0006)]
3	Come on, Faba! Put your back into it!
4	Urrrrgh! Why must I be the one doing such\nmenial, mundane chores?![VAR 0114(0015)]
5	Come on, Intern Faba! We don’t have all day!
6	I-Intern?! Please, don’t call me by that title![VAR 0114(0015)]
7	I don’t think he will return to the position of\nbranch chief anytime soon...[VAR 0114(0016)]
8	Hey! Ms. Wicke! Please, help me just a little![VAR 0114(0015)]
9	Oh, right away![VAR 0114(0016)]
10	I will see you later![VAR 0114(0016)]
11	Aether Paradise is back to business as usual.[VAR 0114(0006)]
12	And it’s all thanks to you, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0006)]
13	I was worried about Mother, and just terrified of\nthose Team Rocket people...[VAR 0114(0006)]
14	But to be honest, having another adventure with\nyou, [VAR 0100(0000)]...\r\nit was a lot of fun.[VAR 0114(0006)]
15	I really, really am grateful![VAR 0114(0006)]
16	When I do my own island challenge, it would be\ngreat if I could do it with you, [VAR 0100(0000)]...[VAR 0114(0006)]
17	... ... ...\n... ... ...[VAR 0114(0006)]
18	But I guess now it’s time for me to go!\nI’ll see you again soon![VAR 0114(0006)]
19	Oh, and before I forget! Here, take these.[VAR 0114(0016)]
20	[~ 20]
21	I imagine Team Rainbow Rocket planned to use\nthose as funding. They hid a whole bunch in the\r\npresident’s room. They’re all yours![VAR 0114(0016)]
22	Hah... That [VAR 1100(00FF,0403)]boygirl had quite some talent...[VAR 0114(0020)]
23	Now...what new world shall I unleash my evil\nschemes upon...?[VAR 0114(0020)]
452
0	Hello.\nI’m Lana.\c\nI serve as the captain of Brooklet Hill.[VAR 0114(000D)]
1	So, trial-goer...\nWill you be attempting my trial?[VAR 0114(000D)]
2	Definitely!
3	Not yet
4	Oh, really?\nI will be waiting, in that case.[VAR 0114(000D)]
5	Then I will explain the trial to you.[VAR 0114(000D)]
6	My particular trial is this...\c\nI want you to herd the Pokémon found in the\npools of Brooklet Hill, driving them downstream\r\nto draw out the Totem Pokémon.\c\nIf I might be so blunt, they are Wishiwashi.\nIt’s Wishiwashi I want you to herd.[VAR 0114(000D)]
7	But I won’t expect you to swim through all the\npools yourself. I have a lovely gift to help you.[VAR 0114(000D)]
8	Lapras was registered to your Ride Pager!
9	If you climb atop Lapras there, you will be able\nto travel over bodies of water.\c\nNow you’ll be able to help drive those Pokémon\ndownstream for me![VAR 0114(000D)]
10	So if you’re ready...\nPlease follow me this way.[VAR 0114(000D)]
453
0	So you made it...[VAR 0114(000D)]
1	Ah...\nI’m sorry. What was your name?\c\n... ... ...\c\nOf course! [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nIt is a lovely name. Just lovely.[VAR 0114(000D)]
2	Now, then.\nDo you see those two splashes over there?[VAR 0114(000D)]
3	I am thinking that at least one of them might\ncontain a Wishiwashi.\r\nIn fact, it’s likely both might. Don’t you agree?\c\nWould you try to drive them downstream with\na little help from Lapras?[VAR 0114(000D)]
4	The Wishiwashi fled downstream, heading\ndeeper into Brooklet Hill...
5	Well, this is a lovely surprise!\nYou’re quite the Trainer, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nPlease carry on driving the Wishiwashi\ndownstream just like that.[VAR 0114(000D)]
6	That splash there!\c\nPlease do check that vigorous splashing and\nkeep driving the Pokémon downstream for me.[VAR 0114(000D)]
454
0	[VAR 0100(0000)]! Look there!\nYes, just over there![VAR 0114(000D)]
1	It would seem we succeeded in drawing out\nthe Totem Pokémon![VAR 0114(000D)]
2	Strike against the totem with all your strength!\nAnd seize victory![VAR 0114(000D)]
455
0	Wahhhhtahhh!
456
0	Very well done, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nPlease come back this way.[VAR 0114(000D)]
1	What a very surprising surprise...\c\nWho would have thought it?\c\nThat all those Wishiwashi gathering would have\nsummoned an Araquanid, that is.\c\nHeh heh...\nEven I was caught—hook, line, and sinker![VAR 0114(000D)]
2	You were amazing, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nTruly impressive.\c\nPlease take this.[VAR 0114(000D)]
3	You do know what this is, don’t you?\c\nWatch. This is how you use Waterium Z.[VAR 0114(000D)]
4	And I have more than just that to offer you.\nAnother token for clearing my trial...\c\nHere. This is a Lana original.\nOne of my own handmade fishing rods.[VAR 0114(000D)]
5	This is how you use my fishing rod:\c\nWhen you want to fish for Pokémon, look for\npiles of rocks in the water.\r\nFish like to hide in the shadows there.\c\nWhen you see your bob dip under the water,\nyou have a bite. But you won’t for long.\c\nThe Pokémon will struggle to get away, so\npress  as soon as you see the “!” mark.[VAR 0114(000D)]
6	If you want to catch any of the Pokémon you\nfish up for your team, I recommend Dive Balls.[VAR 0114(000D)]
7	By the way...\c\nDid you know I once reeled in a red Gyarados?[VAR 0114(000D)]
8	You did?!
9	Did you really?
10	Well, what do you think?[VAR 0114(000D)]
11	You did a fine job today.\c\nShall I see you back to the Pokémon Center on\nRoute 5?[VAR 0114(000D)]
12	Good. Let’s be going, then.\nAnd you can always do a spot of fishing later.[VAR 0114(000D)]
13	I understand. Oh yes, I understand all too well.\c\nThe siren call of the sea...\nand the urge to fish up something wonderful![VAR 0114(000D)]
457
0	What is it, [VAR 0100(0000)]?\c\nDo you need to leave so that you might prepare\nyourself better for my trial?[VAR 0114(000D)]
1	I understand.\c\nIt’s unfortunate, of course, but go prepare\nyourself so you can come try again.[VAR 0114(000D)]
2	Defeat the totem to prove your skill to me.\c\nAnd...well, you may find that using Grass- or\nElectric-type moves will be to your advantage.\c\nOr you could always resort to using an\nX Sp. Def or two, or perhaps a Dire Hit.\c\nDo not let your guard down.\nThe totem is not to be trifled with.[VAR 0114(000D)]
3	Then, please go ahead and drive those frisky\nPokémon downstream to call out the totem![VAR 0114(000D)]
4	So, [VAR 0100(0000)]...\nYou bowed out of the trial of Lana.[VAR 0114(000D)]
458
0	Yes, [VAR 0100(0000)]?\nYou’ve found me again.\c\nWould you like to attempt my trial once more?[VAR 0114(000D)]
1	Definitely!
2	Not yet
3	Oh, really?\nI will be waiting, in that case.[VAR 0114(000D)]
4	Good. Then to review my trial’s requirements...\c\nI want you to drive the Wishiwashi found in the\npools of Brooklet Hill downstream, in order to\r\ndraw out the Totem Pokémon.[VAR 0114(000D)]
5	Good. Then we should head downstream to\nmeet the totem![VAR 0114(000D)]
6	If you’re ready, please follow me this way.[VAR 0114(000D)]

8	Ah, the breath of the jungle...\c\nI can tell just what today’s special should be...[VAR 0114(000E)]
9	Yup! It’s gotta be!\c\nMy secret specialty: the Super Mallow Special![VAR 0114(000E)]
10	I’m gonna need you to find three ingredients\nfor me!\c\nI’ll need a Mago Berry, some Honey, and a\nBig Root![VAR 0114(000E)]
11	Here you go! I brought you a Forage Bag to hold\nall the ingredients you’ll gather for your trial.[VAR 0114(000E)]
12	If you just tossed all the trial ingredients in your\nown Bag, it would make something all right...\r\nSomething like a Mallow Mess, I guess![VAR 0114(000E)]
13	Let’s go and find the first ingredient right away![VAR 0114(000E)]
14	Geez, those Fomantis...\nI wonder if they could tell how strong you are?[VAR 0114(000E)]
15	You can find Mago Berries around here.\c\nBut you’ll also find Fomantis living here, ’cause\nthey love Mago Berries, too.\c\nIf you take a Mago Berry that the Fomantis had\ntheir eyes on, they might not take it too kindly![VAR 0114(000E)]
16	When you’re done gathering ingredients here,\njust let me know![VAR 0114(000E)]
17	[~ 17]
18	[~ 18]
19	OK, then, here in Lush Jungle...[VAR 0114(000E)]

21	[~ 21]

0	What? Could it be?! You want to leave\nthe jungle?!\c\nYou’ll have to start this trial over from scratch!\nIs that OK with you?[VAR 0114(000E)]
1	Well, come back to the trial whenever you’ve\ngot your items and your mind right![VAR 0114(000E)]
2	OK! Then get out there and find my ingredients![VAR 0114(000E)]
461
0	Looks like you bit off more than you could\nchew in my trial, huh?[VAR 0114(000E)]
1	Lush Jungle has some tough Pokémon, it’s true.\c\nRemember that Fire- and Flying-type moves are\nsuper effective against Bug and Grass types.\c\nNow get back in there and do your best![VAR 0114(000E)]
2	Lush Jungle’s totem is tough, it’s true.\nLurantis is a tricky opponent.\c\nRemember that Fire- and Flying-type moves are\nsuper effective against Bug and Grass types.\c\nAnd don’t forget to factor in the effects of the\nweather!\c\nIf the sunlight has turned harsh, some Grass\ntypes can regain HP or use powerful moves\r\nfrom out of nowhere![VAR 0114(000E)]
3	OK, then, here in Lush Jungle...[VAR 0114(000E)]
462

2	[~ 2]
3	[~ 3]
4	You’ll need to find a Mago Berry for me.\c\nBut you’ll find a lot of a certain Pokémon\ncalled Fomantis living around here.\c\nThey tend to live in trees that are dripping\nwith Honey.[VAR 0114(000E)]
5	You can harvest Honey from the flowers that\nbloom here in the jungle!\c\nBut you’ll also find plenty of Pokémon where\nthere are lots of flowers![VAR 0114(000E)]
6	A Big Root, huh?\nYou can find them near the trees deep in the\r\njungle that look kind of like Sudowoodo!\c\nBut you’ll also find that some of the trees that\nlook like Sudowoodo ARE actually Sudowoodo!\r\nGood luck and watch out![VAR 0114(000E)]
7	So, about that ingredient...\nYou sure that’s the one you want to grab?\c\nIf any Pokémon had their eyes on it, you\nmight be taking something the Pokémon thinks\r\nbelongs to them. And then they may come\r\nattack you later.[VAR 0114(000E)]
8	I’ll be fine!
9	O-oh...
10	If you have to think that hard about it,\nthen maybe try somewhere else, hmm?[VAR 0114(000E)]
11	Then it’s on to the next ingredient!\nChop-chop! Let’s keep moving![VAR 0114(000E)]
12	When you find the ingredients you’re sure you\nwant, come show them to me, OK?[VAR 0114(000E)]
13	All right, [VAR 0100(0000)], that’s what I like\nto see!\c\nSince you’ve got all the ingredients, let’s head\nback to the entrance.[VAR 0114(000E)]

18	People say Pokémon are lured in by flowers and\ngather around them.\c\nWatch out when you see a bunch of flowers if\nyou don’t want to get attacked![VAR 0114(000F)]
19	These ingredients are important for this trial,\nbut they’re also very important to the Pokémon\r\nthat live in Lush Jungle.\c\nThis Thick Club I’m going to give to Mallow, too,\nwas the result of serious effort on the part of\r\nmy Marowak and I.[VAR 0114(000F)]
20	Mallow’s trial... Let’s hope she doesn’t take\nthings too far.[VAR 0114(000F)]
21	Oh, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Are you here for\nMallow’s trial, too?[VAR 0114(000D)]
22	Yup
23	Why do you ask?
24	Oh, I was just taking a guess. Looks like you got\nlured in, too, huh?\c\nI came because Mallow asked me to bring her\nsome Fresh Water.[VAR 0114(000D)]
25	Heh heh. Mallow asked me to bring her some\nFresh Water, so here I am.\c\nI wanted to have a look around here for a\nBig Root that I could use as a fishing rod\r\nanyway, though.[VAR 0114(000D)]
26	I’m sure a fresh-faced Trainer like you will be\nable to find a nice, fresh Big Root in no time![VAR 0114(000D)]

2	Bzzzrt... Zrt...
3	Bzzzrt... Zrt...[VAR 0114(0052)]
4	Charja...

6	Tekyu!
7	Tekyu...

0	You’re getting close to your goal...\c\nI imagine you must’ve come here to\nattempt the trial, huh?[VAR 0114(0010)]
1	So... Uh...[VAR 0114(0010)]
2	Where are the Charjabug?[VAR 0114(0010)]
3	Um, Molayne said...
4	I guess it’s their dinnertime?
5	Oh... They’re eating...\nRight.[VAR 0114(0010)]
6	The Charjabug are real gluttons, you know.[VAR 0114(0010)]
7	The Charjabug help me out with my trial, so\ncan you go get them all for me?[VAR 0114(0010)]
8	I’ll have to get everything else ready while\nyou do that...[VAR 0114(0010)]
9	I’m gonna have to get Togedemaru’s help, too.\nThis’ll be my first time testing it...[VAR 0114(0010)]
10	S-so it would be a huge help if you would go call\nall the Charjabug for me![VAR 0114(0010)]
471
0	The door is locked by the security system!
1	You gathered those Charjabug quickly...\nI knew there was something special about you.[VAR 0114(0010)]
2	So, over there... That’s the room where we have\nthe trial.[VAR 0114(0010)]
3	Switching off the security system![VAR 0114(0010)]
4	Tekyukyu!
472
0	This time I’ve made two machines to summon\nthe Totem Pokémon![VAR 0114(0010)]
1	I call this one the Pinger. It’s the machine that\nactually summons the Totem Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0010)]
2	And this one, the Roller, is designed to provide\nelectricity to the Pinger.[VAR 0114(0010)]
3	We’ll use both the Roller and the Pinger during\nmy trial.[VAR 0114(0010)]
4	But we’ll need the help of Charjabug to use\nthe Roller...[VAR 0114(0010)]
473
0	So, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Did you begin the trial?[VAR 0114(001C)]
1	Uh... Big Mo...[VAR 0114(0010)]
2	Oops, that’s right... Sorry, Soffy. The Charjabug\nare still outside.[VAR 0114(001C)]
3	You see, Charjabug create electricity as they\ndigest their food.[VAR 0114(001C)]
4	They are outside with their food now, but we\nkinda need them to start the trial.[VAR 0114(001C)]
5	Right! [VAR 0100(0000)] and I will go and gather\nup the Charjabug.[VAR 0114(001C)]
6	I’ll be waiting for you outside, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(001C)]
7	I really like watching the Charjabug burrow\nunderground for food. I think they’re really cute.[VAR 0114(0010)]
8	I’m gonna run a few more checks on the Roller\nand the Pinger.[VAR 0114(0010)]
474
0	There you are! The Charjabug are all fed\nand happy![VAR 0114(001C)]
1	Zap zap!
2	Hm? Let’s see... I’m only counting six! They’re\nnot all here yet.[VAR 0114(001C)]
3	I’m sorry, [VAR 0100(0000)], but do you think\nyou could go find the remaining Charjabug?\c\nWe’re only missing three. They should still be\neating in that empty lot by the bus station.[VAR 0114(001C)]
4	You only have [VAR 0200(0001)] Charjabug left,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]! [VAR 1101(0001,0402)]ItThey should still be eating in\r\nthe area in front of the bus stop. If you could\r\nfind [VAR 1101(0001,0402)]itthem, that would be great![VAR 0114(001C)]
5	Bzzzzzzrt.
6	How’s it going, [VAR 0100(0000)]? Didja find all\nthose Charjabug?[VAR 0114(001C)]
7	Oh, seems like Sevenjabug is missing... It always\nwanders off to strange places.\c\nHm? Oh, we call the nine Charjabug by their\nnicknames! Onejabug all the way to Ninejabug.[VAR 0114(001C)]
8	Only Sevenjabug is missing. It always wanders\noff to strange places.[VAR 0114(001C)]
9	Jabugabug!
10	Oh, Sevenjabug, there you are! Thanks for the\nhelp in finding it, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nNow, we should get back to Sophocles. No\ndoubt he’s been craning his neck like an\r\nExeggutor waiting for us![VAR 0114(001C)]
11	[~ 11]
12	[~ 12]
13	There’s...a Pokémon buried here...?
14	*rustle rustle*\n*rummage rummage*
15	You found Molayne’s Charjabug!
16	It looks like something was eating here...
475
0	Onejabug, Twojabug, and Threejabug are all on\nboard the Roller... Yes! We should be ready for\r\nthem to lend us their electricity, eh, Soffy?[VAR 0114(001C)]
1	[~ 1]
2	Tekyuuu?
3	Togedemaru and Charjabug get along very well.\nWe use Togedemaru’s Ability, Lightning Rod, to\r\nabsorb any sudden surges from Charjabug so\r\nwe don’t get zapped![VAR 0114(0010)]
4	Oh, and by the way, we gave Togedemaru a\nnickname—Togemaru.[VAR 0114(0010)]
476
0	So, do you want to begin my\ntrial, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0010)]
1	I’ve been waiting for it!
2	Wait a little longer...
3	OK, when you’re ready, just come talk to me...[VAR 0114(0010)]
4	Wow, you’re really into this... OK, let me explain\nhow my trial works.[VAR 0114(0010)]
5	First, you need to connect the Charjabug that\nare on the Roller.[VAR 0114(0010)]
6	We’ll use the electricity from the Charjabug to\npower up the machine... That should let us call\r\nthe Totem Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0010)]
7	Use the four buttons on the edges of the Roller\nto rotate the panels, and connect the Charjabug\r\nin a line.[VAR 0114(0010)]
8	Just as an example, this is what happens when\nyou rotate the panels.[VAR 0114(001C)]
9	You don’t need to worry about which way the\nCharjabug are facing, so long as they’re\r\nconnected in a line.[VAR 0114(0010)]
10	Let me summarize. We connect the Charjabug to\nsummon the Totem Pokémon, which you will\r\nhopefully defeat.[VAR 0114(0010)]
11	Also, as a side note, this is the first time we’re\nusing the two machines, the Roller and\r\nthe Pinger.[VAR 0114(0010)]
12	So let’s get this trial going, OK?\nMy trial is about to begin![VAR 0114(0010)]
13	Sophocles’s trial will tickle your brain, I promise\nyou that![VAR 0114(001C)]
14	Tekyu![VAR 0114(003A)]
477
0	You’re in the middle of my trial, but...\nDo you want to give up?[VAR 0114(0010)]
1	I want to give up
2	I won’t give up
3	Reset the panels
4	OK, let’s start this trial over!\nMy trial is about to begin! Again.[VAR 0114(0010)]
478
0	You probably shouldn’t mess with the\nrotate buttons...
1	[~ 1]
2	Good job, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nThe Charjabug are all connected! Now, let me\r\njust turn the Roller on...[VAR 0114(0010)]
3	[~ 3]
4	[~ 4]

1	Now we’re ready to power up the Pinger![VAR 0114(0010)]
2	Tekyu![VAR 0114(003A)]
3	Yes... It’s working... The electricity from the\nlinked Charjabug is moving along the cable...[VAR 0114(0010)]
4	It’s actually working... The Pinger is getting a\ngood dose of power![VAR 0114(0010)]
5	Now...the Totem Pokémon should be\nhere any minute![VAR 0114(0010)]
6	Bzap!
7	Ah, of course. Elekid love electricity, too. It must\nhave been tempted out by the Pinger.[VAR 0114(001C)]
8	We didn’t call the Pokémon we wanted, but it\nseems like the Pinger works just fine.\c\nSo, what now, Soffy?[VAR 0114(001C)]
9	Hmm, I think one row of Charjabug isn’t giving\nit enough electricity...[VAR 0114(0010)]
10	If that’s the case, all we need to do is add\nanother circuit![VAR 0114(0010)]
11	If my theory is correct, this should let us pump\nmore power into the Pinger!\c\nSo, my trial will continue, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0010)]
480
0	[~ 0]
1	Now we’re ready to power up the Pinger![VAR 0114(0010)]
2	It’s actually working... The Pinger is getting a\ngood dose of power![VAR 0114(0010)]
3	Tekyu![VAR 0114(003A)]
4	Yes! We’re getting much more power than on\nour last try![VAR 0114(0010)]
5	Buzzzzzap!
6	Hm... Electabuzz. It seems like the more power\nwe pump into the Pinger, the bigger Pokémon\r\nit attracts. This is amazing, Soffy![VAR 0114(001C)]
7	If that’s the case, let’s give it some more power!\nThat’ll definitely summon the Totem Pokémon![VAR 0114(001C)]
8	The more Charjabug we connect in a direct\nline, the greater the electrical current that is\r\ngenerated, and the longer it flows...[VAR 0114(0010)]
9	So that means—[VAR 0114(0010)]
10	I’ve got it, [VAR 0100(0000)]! Actually, I think\nyou’ve got it already, too.\c\nSo, my trial will continue to continue![VAR 0114(0010)]
481
0	[~ 0]
1	OK, [VAR 0100(0000)]... The Charjabug are all\nconnected. Everything should be good now.[VAR 0114(0010)]
2	Now we’re ready to connect the Roller with\nthe Pinger!
3	Uh, the cables are looking a little unstable...\nI hope it doesn’t cause a problem...[VAR 0114(0010)]
4	Oh no... The Charjabug will get blasted with\nelectricity if we don’t do something![VAR 0114(0010)]
5	T-Togemaru! What are you doing?!\nAre you trying to save everyone?![VAR 0114(0010)]
6	Togedemaru’s Ability is Lightning Rod. It can\nattract electricity to itself. But...the current is\r\ntoo strong! There’s no way Togedemaru’s\r\nelectric sacs can handle all of it![VAR 0114(001C)]
7	Togemaru! Hang in there![VAR 0114(0010)]
8	Agh! I-I-I gotta do something![VAR 0114(0010)]
9	*craaaaash*
10	Z-z-z-z-zap!
482
0	Thanks, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0010)]
1	Togemaru and company... They were saved by\nthe Totem Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0010)]
2	The Totem Pokémon is really something else!\nAnd that means you’re one heck of a Trainer\r\nto have beaten that totem, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0010)]
3	I’m curious, though. What is that aura that the\nTotem Pokémon surround themselves with?[VAR 0114(001C)]
4	I really need to work on the totem-calling\nmachines, though... Togemaru, and Onejabug\r\nand company—they’re all my precious friends.[VAR 0114(0010)]
5	You’ve got that right, Soffy. Finding things that\nyou notice, even little things, and improving on\r\nthem... That’s how science works. Come to think\r\nof it, that’s how Pokémon battles work, too![VAR 0114(001C)]
483
0	Here, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nI’ll give you this Electrium Z to reward you for\nbeating the Totem Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0010)]
1	Come on, Soffy—you still need to show h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer the\nproper Z-pose to use it![VAR 0114(001C)]
2	... ... ...\n... ... ...\c\n...Watch.[VAR 0114(0010)]
3	Congratulations on clearing your trial!\c\nAnd Sophocles did well as captain, too.[VAR 0114(001C)]
4	I was really nervous...[VAR 0114(0010)]
5	Don’t you worry. I’m sure that I made the right\nchoice in naming you captain.\c\nEven if you are my cousin.[VAR 0114(001C)]
6	Usually it’s the island kahuna who appoints\nthe captains.\c\nBut there are some, er, unusual circumstances\nhere on Ula’ula.[VAR 0114(001C)]
7	So somehow I ended up captain...[VAR 0114(0010)]
8	But you were really great, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0010)]
484
0	So I take it you’re ready to take my trial, right?\nYou did come to my house like I said, after all.[VAR 0114(0012)]
1	That’s why I’m here!
2	That’s not why I’m here!
3	What, really?[VAR 0114(0012)]
4	Heh heh heh...\c\nThen let the trial of Mina begin![VAR 0114(0012)]
5	I guess I’ve got to tell you what you need to do.\nYou have to battle me![VAR 0114(0012)]
6	Phew! Looks like you have had some kind of\nisland challenge!\c\nSince you managed to beat me, though, I’ll give\nyou this Pink Petal as proof.[VAR 0114(0012)]
7	That’s a good start.\nBut you’ve only just begun my real trial.\c\nNow you have to go around to all the captains\nin Alola and get a petal from each one of them![VAR 0114(0012)]
8	I’m here to help you out, though. Come on, tell\nMiss Mina which captain you want to find, hm?[VAR 0114(0012)]
9	Ilima
10	Lana
11	Kiawe
12	Mallow
13	Sophocles
14	Acerola
15	I’m good
16	Ilima, huh?\nHe’s usually up on Route 2, right?\r\nThat’s where Verdant Cavern is, after all.\c\nIf you have trouble tracking him down, try to\nfind a Trial Guide to ask. That might help.[VAR 0114(0012)]
17	Lana’s usually out in Brooklet Hill, yeah?\c\nThough she visits Lush Jungle a lot, too.[VAR 0114(0012)]
18	If Mallow ever has free time, she’ll be in Lush\nJungle looking for ingredients for her cooking.\r\nFor sure.[VAR 0114(0012)]
19	Kiawe? Hmm. Probably off dancing somewhere?\nWith those Marowak of his.[VAR 0114(0012)]
20	If you want Sophocles, you’ve gotta check the\nHokulani Observatory, right?[VAR 0114(0012)]
21	Acerola can be found at Aether House!\nI know that one for sure![VAR 0114(0012)]
22	Why, I almost didn’t recognize you!\c\nYou practically look like a different person than\nthe kid who took on Ilima’s trial back then!
23	If you’re looking for Ilima, he’s off in Hau’oli\nCemetery right now.
24	Hey, trial-goer! Are you looking for Lana?\nI’m afraid she’s not here right now.
25	The captain went off to Lush Jungle again!
26	Alola!\nLet me guess—you’re here for Mina’s trial?\c\nIf you need to find Kiawe, he should be with\nhis Marowak up in Wela Volcano Park.
27	If you’re looking for Captain Mallow, she’s out\nnow collecting ingredients for her cooking.\c\nYou remember the best place for that, right?\nExactly! It’s Lush Jungle!
28	Oh? Are you attempting Mina’s trial, perhaps?\c\nIf you are, you should go on up to Aether House!
29	Hey! Did you need something from me?\c\nIf it’s Ilima you’re looking for, he’s off in Hau’oli\nCemetery right now.
485
0	Greetings.\nCaptain Ilima here.\c\nIt seems you’ve collected a great number of\nZ-Crystals, [VAR 0100(0000)].\r\nYou are positively shining![VAR 0114(000C)]
1	Yes, it’s important to always shine.\c\nYou know, I’ve traveled the world since I was\nyoung with my mother.\r\nShe’s an actress on the stage, you see.[VAR 0114(000C)]
2	In doing so, I came to realize something.\c\nI realized how beautiful my mother was\nwhen she dedicated herself completely to the\r\nrole she was performing onstage...\c\nYes, it is moving to see such complete\ndedication—to anything![VAR 0114(000C)]
3	The brilliance of the Z-Crystals!\nThe gleam of Totem Stickers!\c\nIn my role as captain, I just want to do my part\nto make everyone shine![VAR 0114(000C)]
4	But...let’s set all that aside. You’re here for\nMina’s trial?\c\nThen allow me to check just how strong you\nhave become![VAR 0114(000C)]
5	Yes please!
6	No thanks!
7	In a sense, this is a trial for me as well. A trial to\nsee if the strategy I’ve thought up will work![VAR 0114(000C)]
8	Understood. I’ll take a bit more time to develop\nmy own strategies as well.[VAR 0114(000C)]
9	You— No, you and your Pokémon have become\nquite a delightful team![VAR 0114(000C)]
10	Please take this Orange Petal. It has a definite\nwarmth to it, just like me.[VAR 0114(000C)]
11	So now it seems you have two petals.\c\nWouldn’t you like to see what happens when\nyou have collected all seven?[VAR 0114(000C)]
12	You know, Hau has been out on Mahalo Trail\ndoing nothing but training and has improved a\r\ngood deal![VAR 0114(000C)]
13	For now, though...\nShould I see you to the next captain?[VAR 0114(000C)]
14	Please do
15	I’m good
16	Shall we, then? To Lush Jungle!\nIt’s been a while since I last visited Akala.[VAR 0114(000C)]
17	Please do let me know when you’d like to go to\nLush Jungle.[VAR 0114(000C)]

2	Lana...\nHow about a Bubble Beam from Araquanid?[VAR 0114(000E)]
3	Alola!\nNow who am I?
4	The Hiker
5	The best Hiker
6	The same old Hiker
7	The suspicious Hiker
8	Good to see you again!
9	You looking for Kiawe?\nHe’s...oh! Right there!
10	Thank you for filling in for me while I was away,\nmy good Hiker.[VAR 0114(000F)]
11	You never even have to ask, bro!\c\nNothing better than dancing up here on the\nvolcano with my main Marowak and you!
12	Yes... That’s exactly the sort of intense training\nthat made me who I am today.[VAR 0114(000F)]
13	That’s why I was thinking that you might be a\ngood candidate to become the captain after me.[VAR 0114(000F)]
14	I think you should let someone who really wants\nto be captain take the job, bro.\c\nI’m not the type who can help trial-goers or\nthe Marowak live up to their full potential.\c\n’Cause all I really want to do is bust a move!
15	Is that so?[VAR 0114(000F)]
16	You’re here for Mina’s trial, right?\nWould you like to burn in battle with me?[VAR 0114(000F)]
17	Of course
18	Sounds painful
19	B-but why?![VAR 0114(000F)]
20	Being thrilled by an opponent’s excitement...\nNothing makes me want to battle more![VAR 0114(000F)]
21	Astounding![VAR 0114(000F)]
22	Alola!
23	My Hiker friend was so pleased by your right\nanswer that he simply had to battle you![VAR 0114(000F)]
24	See? I can’t stop myself from wanting to dance!\nI’m just not the type who should be a captain.
25	[VAR 0100(0000)], you were spectacular!\c\nYou were so spectacular that I will give you\nthis flaming-hot Red Petal![VAR 0114(000F)]
26	The energy that burns through Wela Volcano\nburns through us as well![VAR 0114(000F)]
27	If you’re hoping to complete Mina’s trial, you\nshould make for Hokulani Observatory next.\r\nSince you’re here, shall we go together?[VAR 0114(000F)]
28	Yes please
29	No thanks
30	Then, let’s be gone in a flash![VAR 0114(000F)]
31	I see. Come talk to me again if you do want to\ngo to the observatory together later.[VAR 0114(000F)]
32	You can’t just dance to somebody else’s tune,\nyou know? Be yourself, and strut your stuff!\r\nI know I’d rather be footloose and fancy-free!
488
0	Ahh![VAR 0114(000E)]
1	Fey fey!
2	*munch munch*
3	Ahhh... Aromatherapy...\c\nI feel so relaxed whenever Comfey hits me with\nit... Like all my worries just waft away...[VAR 0114(000E)]
4	Are you sure you should relax quite so much,\nMallow? I quite like it when you’re full of energy.\c\nYou’re much less likely to be startled by an\nunexpected visitor when you are.[VAR 0114(000D)]
5	[VAR 0100(0000)]?![VAR 0114(000E)]
6	When did you get here?![VAR 0114(000E)]
7	N-not that it matters.\c\nI was just trying to get closer to my Pokémon\nto see what kinds of special dishes they might\r\nlike me to make for them. That’s all![VAR 0114(000E)]
8	Like I thought, true relaxation might be out of\nthe question for you, my spry Mallow.[VAR 0114(000D)]
9	I can so relax!\nYou know I can, right, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(000E)]
10	Sure you can
11	Heh...
12	Oh, geez! You two!\nI’ll show you! I’ll prove it in battle![VAR 0114(000E)]
13	Prove it, then
14	Now hold on a sec!
15	Why should I?\nI want to have a battle![VAR 0114(000E)]
16	Now I understand why the Mallow Special is\nquite so special. Heh heh...[VAR 0114(000D)]
17	Now that my Pokémon have me feeling all\nrelaxed...take our all-out attack![VAR 0114(000E)]
18	Awww, I lost...\c\nGuess now I’ll have to get my Grass-type\nPokémon to make me feel all better again...[VAR 0114(000E)]
19	Oh, like you can talk, Lana!\nYou’re not the one in hot water![VAR 0114(000E)]
20	Poor Mallow is feeling bashful. But I know how\nto guarantee you keep what you saw a secret.[VAR 0114(000D)]
21	A battle? You’re on!
22	A battle? Hold on!
23	Oh dear, Mallow.\nIt looks like your secret might be out...[VAR 0114(000D)]
24	I knew you would take my bait, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nI don’t really mind if you tell Mallow’s secret.\r\nNot as long as I get to battle you![VAR 0114(000D)]
25	Here, take this Green Petal!\c\nI’m only giving it to you because you’re doing\nMina’s trial, though! Not because I’m trying to\r\nget you to keep secret what you saw here!\r\nThat’s a total coincidence![VAR 0114(000E)]
26	And take this from me...\nA Blue Petal.\c\nDid you know? The Blue Petal is the same\nshape as one of Wishiwashi’s scales.[VAR 0114(000D)]
27	So, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nYou’re going to Kiawe’s place next?\c\nDo you want to go to Wela Volcano Park with\ntwo pretty pals like us?[VAR 0114(000E)]
28	Pretty please!
29	Pretty much no
30	Well, that was quite the vigorous answer!\nLet’s definitely go to the volcano together.[VAR 0114(000D)]
31	Traveling with someone is like a Destiny Bond,\nhuh? It really ties you together somehow.\r\nIf you ever want to go with us, say the word![VAR 0114(000E)]
32	You know, [VAR 0100(0000)], I have to say...\nyou are quite the catch.[VAR 0114(000D)]

6	Hey, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nThanks again for doing that favor for me before.[VAR 0114(001C)]

10	I’m ready for you!
11	I’m not ready...
12	OK, well, I’ll be waiting...[VAR 0114(0010)]

15	I believe in my Pokémon’s strength...\c\nI trained them together with Big Mo, after all![VAR 0114(0010)]
16	That was amazing, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nYou know about as much about Pokémon\nbattling as Big Mo...[VAR 0114(0010)]
17	You both did very well!\c\nI’m looking forward to seeing how far you both\nwill make it in the future.\c\nSoffy... The observatory is all yours now.[VAR 0114(001C)]
18	It’s time for the next generation to start taking\ntheir place among the stars, I guess.\c\nSo, Soffy...\nHokulani Observatory is all yours now.[VAR 0114(001C)]

24	Is he really gone?
25	You gonna be OK?
26	Yeah...\nHe’ll come back. It’s not forever.\c\nHe said that he had something he had to do\nfor Professor Kukui, that’s all.[VAR 0114(0010)]
27	You’ve gotta finish Mina’s trial, right?\nDo you want me to take you to the next stop?[VAR 0114(0010)]
28	Yes please
29	No thanks
30	OK...\nLet’s go to Aether House, then...[VAR 0114(0010)]

3	Oh, you [VAR 1100(00FF,0403)]boygirl...\nFinishing up your island challenge, is that it?[VAR 0114(000A)]
4	Acerola’s out at the moment.\nThink this old man’ll do in her place?\r\nI’ll only hit as hard as she would’ve done.[VAR 0114(000A)]
5	You want to take me on, boy?[VAR 0114(000A)]
6	You want to take me on, girl?[VAR 0114(000A)]

9	You think I’m just made of free time, huh?[VAR 0114(000A)]
10	Hmm. All right, then.\nNice and gentle...[VAR 0114(000A)]
11	You got me good, kid.\nHope I don’t get in trouble with the girl for this.[VAR 0114(000A)]
12	Here. Take it.\nIt’s the only reward you’ll get from me.[VAR 0114(000A)]
13	I suppose I ought to take you on in Acerola’s\nplace, huh?\c\nBut that boy Hau got me good when I tried to\nbattle at about Acerola’s level, so I don’t feel\r\nmuch like bothering again.[VAR 0114(000A)]
14	So here. Just take it.\c\nAcerola left me some of these, so have one.[VAR 0114(000A)]
15	You should go tell that young filly Mina that\nyou’re done with what she asked you to do.[VAR 0114(000A)]

32	Hey, howzit! You feel like taking a little trip\nacross the waves with Mantine?\c\nThis is the [VAR 0105(0000)] Surf Spot.\nJust tell me what I can help you with.
33	What’s that board there?
34	Teach me how to surf!
35	Nothing, thanks
36	That board over there is what we call a\nranking board.\c\nThat’s where you can see the highest-ranked\nsurfers at each Surf Spot.\c\nYou ought to go riding the waves with Mantine,\ntoo, and see if you can nab that No. 1 spot!
37	We’ve got some great waves again today,\nhere in Alola.\c\nYou should definitely jump on Mantine there\nand try to get a real high score!
38	Huh? You can’t mean that you seriously forgot\nhow to surf on Mantine?!\c\nOK, little friend. Don’t you worry.\nI’ve got you covered!\c\nIt does take a little while to cover all the basics,\nthough, so you sure you’re ready to start now?
39	Then here we go!
40	I’d be happy to share my little lesson with you\nanytime, so come back whenever you’re free!
41	You know, I bet you could probably even master\nthis move now...
42	You learned the aerial move Lanturn 360!
43	You learned the aerial move Primarina Twist!
44	You learned the aerial move Starmie 720!
45	Pull off a Lanturn 360 when the waves are\nhigh, and you can try to nab an even higher\r\nscore than you’d get with other moves!
46	Pulling off a Primarina Twist when the waves\nare pretty low will net you more points than\r\nusing other moves would do.
47	The Starmie 720 is a real cool move that you\ncan use on any kind of wave to try to rack up\r\nsome big points!
48	Use that new move and master the waves,\nlittle cousin!
49	Tell me about moves
50	Gorebyss Spiral
51	Huntail Spiral
52	Lanturn 360
53	Primarina Twist
54	Starmie 720
55	Over-the-Gyarados
56	Magikarp Splash
57	Never mind
58	Which move do you want to learn about?
59	The Gorebyss Spiral is a great move to\ntry out while you’re in the air anyway.\r\nTry it out once, when you’re pulling other tricks!
60	The Huntail Spiral is a great move to\ntry out while you’re in the air anyway.\r\nTry it out once, when you’re pulling other tricks!
61	The Over-the-Gyarados is a killer move\nthat boosts your score from the last jump\r\nyou pulled off, too!\c\nBut if you use it twice, then your score doesn’t\ngo up anymore—it goes down!
62	The Magikarp Splash is a move that you can pull\noff when you fail to pull off any other moves.\r\nCrazy, right?\c\nTry to get a real high score by using it just\nonce. That’s the trick!
63	You’ve dominated every single surfing course!\c\nYou should definitely swing by the local branch\nof the Surf Association. It’s in Heahea City.
64	Eeeh! Eeeh!

2	Hmmm. [VAR 0102(0000)], is it?\c\nYou picked quite a fine nickname.\c\nBut I think we could give it something even\nbetter. What do you say?
3	I see! What would you like the new nickname\nto be?\c
4	Done! From now on, this Pokémon shall be\nknown as [VAR 0102(0000)]!\c\nYou’re right, that does seem to fit it better.\nNicely done!
5	OK! Come see me again if you change\nyour mind.
6	Done! From now on, this Pokémon shall be\nknown as [VAR 0102(0000)]!\c\nIt looks no different from before, but we both\nknow this name is vastly superior!\r\nHow fortunate for you!
7	Hmmm. [VAR 0102(0000)]!\nThat is a truly impeccable nickname!\r\nI can’t say anything bad about it!\c\nTake good care of [VAR 0102(0000)]!
8	Now, now...\nThat is merely an Egg!
9	Or do you want to quit giving the Pokémon a\nnickname and change back to the name that\r\nthe Pokémon had when you two met?
10	Yes, yes. [VAR 0101(0001)]!\c\nIt reminds you of the time when you first met\nthe Pokémon!\c\nCome see me again if you want to give\nPokémon nicknames.

45	Oh?\nYou’re originally from the Kanto region, right?\c\nI’ve traveled around tons of different regions,\nso I can easily tell something like that!\c\nAnd not just for people, either. I can tell which\nregion your Pokémon came from, too.
46	Do you want me to take a look and tell you if\nany of your Pokémon are from other regions?
47	Hmm... Let me see...

56	The screen says “Alola Photo Techniques That\nEvery Trainer Must Know!” Want to take a look?
57	Which topic would you like to read about?
58	Introduction
59	1. Picking your poses
60	2. Placing your Pokémon
61	3. Changing directions
62	4. Operating the camera
63	5. Taking the best shot
64	I’m done here
65	“I want to take amazing photos and show them\noff to the rest of the world!”\c\nIf you agree, read on to master five techniques\nyou’ll need to start taking pro photos in no time!
66	First and foremost, imagine what kind of photo\nit is you want to capture!\c\nThink about all the different poses you could\nmake, and try to decide what you want to do.\c\nThis is a good time to imagine which Pokémon\nyou’d like to appear with you in the photo.
67	While you’ve got an image in mind, next decide\nwhere you should place your Pokémon.\c\nAs you move your Pokémon about, consider how\nit’ll look in relation to your pose and position.
68	Once you’ve settled on your Pokémon’s position,\nturn it to decide which direction it should face.
69	Operate the camera like a pro to capture a\nshot exactly as it looked in your imagination!\c\nIt will be crucial to first move the camera to face\nthe direction you were imagining.\c\nOnce you’ve got it in the right place, use the\nzoom functions so your subjects look spot-on!
70	If you’ve made it this far, you’re in the home\nstretch! Once your Pokémon makes an action...\c\nThat’s it! Slam that shutter to catch that\nperfect pose for your perfect picture!\c\nOnce you get the hang of all that, also keep\nin mind how background images move, too.\c\nIf you can do all that, you’ll be a real pro! There\nare lots of backgrounds, too, so have a look!
71	That was a great photo shoot! Would you like to\nmove right ahead to adding some stickers now?
72	Then let’s open up your album...

0	The trace of Pokémon picked up by Island Scan\nhas disappeared...\c\nIsland Scan ended.
1	The energy for Island Scan ran out.\c\nThe trace of the Pokémon picked up by\nIsland Scan has been lost...
2	You lost the sight of it, but the hint of it is\nstill lingering...
3	You successfully caught the UB!\nStill [VAR 0200(0000)] more beast[VAR 1101(0000,0100)]s to catch!

0	Uh...\nNow who was I again?\c\n... ... ...\n... ... ...\c\nOh yes! I’m the Move Deleter!\nI can make Pokémon forget their moves.
1	You’re here so I can make your Pokémon forget\na move, um-hmm?
2	Which Pokémon would that be?
3	Just remember me when there’s something you\nwant to forget!
4	What’s that, friend?\nThat Pokémon only knows one move, you know?
5	What’s this, friend?\nEggs don’t know any moves before they hatch.
6	Mm-hmm...\nAnd which move should it forget?
7	It was a great success!\c\nYour Pokémon has forgotten that it ever even\nknew [VAR 0107(0000)]!
8	Everyone calls me Madam Memorial.\c\nI know every move that a Pokémon learns as it\ngrows, you see.\c\nI can also help your Pokémon remember any of\nthose moves that it has let go in the past.\c\nI’ll help your Pokémon recover their lost moves\nin exchange for Heart Scales, if you have any.
9	Would you like to remind your Pokémon of a\nlong-forgotten move?
10	If there’s a move you’d like one of your Pokémon\nto remember, bring me a [VAR 0109(0000)]!
11	Which Pokémon is it?
12	That is an Egg.
13	This Pokémon doesn’t yet have any moves to\nbe recovered.
14	Which move would you like it to remember?
15	You gave a [VAR 0109(0000)] in thanks.
16	Now it has remembered that move!\nCome again if you need anything else!
17	Would you like me to teach Volt Tackle to\nyour Pikachu?

0	Did you get a Pokémon from the island kahuna\nor professor maybe?\c\nIt doesn’t matter if it’s evolved into something\nelse since then.\c\nAs long as it’s a Fire-, Water-, or Grass-type\nPokémon that new Trainers are given around\r\nhere, and it’s really friendly toward you, I’ll\r\nteach it a special move—a battle-combo move.
1	A special move...\c\nShall I teach your Pokémon a\nbattle-combo move?
2	There is no move that I can teach to any of the\nPokémon you are with...
3	I see...\nWell, see you next time.
4	Which Pokémon will it be then?
5	That Pokémon can’t learn a move from me.
6	Do you want me to teach my move to an Egg?!\nYou are being unreasonable.
7	This Pokémon... It doesn’t look like it’s too\ncomfortable with you yet.
8	That Pokémon already knows one of my moves.
9	Do you want me to teach [VAR 0101(0000)]\n[VAR 0107(0001)]?
10	My favorite Pokémon are all the Pokémon you\nget from people like professors or kahunas.\c\nI teach special moves—battle-combo moves—to\nthose Pokémon and the Pokémon that evolve\r\nfrom them. That’s what I do!

0	The strongest Dragon-type move is called\nDraco Meteor.\c\nDo you want me to teach the move to\nyour Pokémon?
1	I understand... Moves that are too strong\ncan be difficult to use.
2	This Pokémon could learn this move, but\nthere is one condition that needs to be met.\c\nThat is...the Pokémon has to be completely\nfriendly toward you.\c\nI can teach the move only after the Pokémon\nbecomes totally bonded with you.
3	None of the Pokémon you are with right now can\nlearn this move...\c\nPlease come back when you obtain a Pokémon\nthat can learn this move!
4	Then please select the Pokémon that will learn\nthis move.
5	Oh, this Pokémon can’t learn this move.
6	Oh, this is an Egg.\nI can’t teach the move to an Egg.

1	You don’t seem to have Rayquaza—the only\nPokémon that can learn Dragon Ascent.
2	Come back anytime you need my help.
3	Which Pokémon do you want me to teach\nthe move to?
4	That Pokémon can’t learn Dragon Ascent.\nOnly Rayquaza can learn the move.
5	I’ve never heard about an Egg that can use\nDragon Ascent!
6	That Rayquaza has already learned\nDragon Ascent.
7	Do you want me to teach Dragon Ascent\nto that [VAR 0101(0000)] of yours?

27	OK!\nThen it’s time to explore that cave!\c\nI wonder if they’ll find any treasure, hm?\nHo, I just can’t wait to see![VAR 0114(002F)]
28	You can’t send anyone to explore the cave if\nyou don’t have any Pokémon on the isle!\c\nCatch some more Pokémon and put them in your\nBoxes if you’d like them to have an adventure![VAR 0114(002F)]
29	Do you want to call your Pokémon back from\nthe current expedition?[VAR 0114(002F)]
30	OK! Everybody back!\nWe’re calling it for this expedition!\c\nJust tap on the sign and let me know if you want\nto send your Pokémon out to explore again.[VAR 0114(002F)]
31	Looks like you don’t have any Pokémon who are\nprepared to go out into that cave for you...\c\nYou should put out some Poké Beans when your\nPokémon are out exploring on your behalf![VAR 0114(002F)]
32	You don’t have any Pokémon out exploring now!\c\nYou should put out some Poké Beans when your\nPokémon are out exploring on your behalf![VAR 0114(002F)]
33	Think you could clear out that treasure crate for\nme before we send any more Pokémon out on\r\nanother adventure?
34	Choose the Pokémon that you’ll send out\nto play on the play gym![VAR 0114(002F)]
35	And what kind of drink would you like to make\nyour Pokémon? Hydration is key![VAR 0114(002F)]
36	How many play sessions should your Pokémon\ncomplete this time?[VAR 0114(002F)]

38	Looks like a real fun time is being had, I’d say![VAR 0114(002F)]
39	Do you want to make your Pokémon quit in the\nmiddle of their play?[VAR 0114(002F)]
40	OK! Everybody back!\nPlaytime is over for now!\c\nAnd just tap on the sign whenever you want to\ncollect your Pokémon.[VAR 0114(002F)]
41	Did you come to collect your Pokémon?[VAR 0114(002F)]
42	I’ll just want to check the play structures before\nwe bring more Pokémon in to play.\c\nSorry, but could you collect all of your Pokémon\nso I can give it a quick look-over?[VAR 0114(002F)]
43	OK! Looks good.\nAll the equipment is in working condition!\c\nJust tap on the sign whenever you want to\nlet some more of your Pokémon loose to play![VAR 0114(002F)]
44	Your Boxes are full of Pokémon!\nGoodness gracious!\c\nIf you want to collect your Pokémon, you’ll need\nto make some space for them first.[VAR 0114(002F)]
45	You don’t have any Pokémon out playing on\nthe play equipment now.\c\nWhy don’t you start by inviting some Pokémon\nto come play here on the isle?[VAR 0114(002F)]
46	The play session has wrapped up, I’d say.\nTuckered your Pokémon right out, we did!\c\nYou should put out some Poké Beans while your\nPokémon play so that they have a snack ready![VAR 0114(002F)]
47	Choose the Pokémon you’d like to invite to relax\nin the hot spring![VAR 0114(002F)]
48	I’ll send [VAR 0101(0000)] to your Box then.[VAR 0114(002F)]
49	This Egg looks ready to hatch at any moment!\c\nBut your Boxes are full of Pokémon and there’s\nsimply no room for it!\c\nThink you could organize your Boxes a bit and\nfree up a space for it?[VAR 0114(002F)]
50	This Egg looks ready to hatch at any moment![VAR 0114(002F)]
51	I think this Egg’s still got a little while to go\nbefore it’ll be ready to hatch.[VAR 0114(002F)]
52	This Egg still looks like it’s a quite a while away\nfrom hatching.[VAR 0114(002F)]
53	It’s always a nice idea to put out Poké Beans\nin the crates after you invite Pokémon over.[VAR 0114(002F)]

179	Welcome!\nYou’ve come to Poké Pelago!\c\nThese uninhabited islands exist solely for the\ndelight of Pokémon.\c\nBut I suppose I should introduce myself, eh?\nHa ha, how rude of me!\c\nYou can call me Mohn!\nI’m in charge of keeping Poké Pelago running.[VAR 0114(0030)]
180	Glad to see you again!\nThis is it: Poké Pelago!\c\nThese uninhabited islands exist solely for the\ndelight of Pokémon.\c\nAnd you remember me? You can call me Mohn!\nI’m in charge of keeping Poké Pelago running.[VAR 0114(002F)]
181	And you are...[VAR 0100(0000)], right?\c\nOK!\nThen let’s get things started![VAR 0114(002F)]
182	The Pokémon that you’ve deposited in your PC\nBoxes can freely come here to Poké Pelago to\r\nhave a bit of fun whenever they want.\c\nRight now we only have one small isle available\nfor them to play on, but if you’ll help me out,\r\nthat won’t be true for very long!\c\nSo here’s what you need to do first.\nWould you pick up the Poké Beans that have\r\nfallen to the ground around the island?[VAR 0114(002F)]
183	Pokémon love Poké Beans.\nThey’re delicious and nutritious!\c\nAnd they can also sprout into Poké Beanstalks,\nlike that one in the middle of the island.\c\nThe one you just picked up is a Plain Bean.\nThere are also rare Poké Beans called Patterned\r\nBeans and even Rainbow Beans!\c\nI love hands-on learning. Don’t you agree?\nSo why don’t you give that Poké Beanstalk a\r\ngood shake and see what happens?[VAR 0114(002F)]
184	Shake the beanstalk to drop some Poké Beans!\nPick up the Poké Beans to add to your stores!\c\nOK, now you’ve got it!\nSee! Isn’t it better to learn by doing?\c\nYou can collect Poké Beans once a day or so.\c\nIf no new Poké Beans come tumbling down,\nthen wait a day and then try again![VAR 0114(002F)]
185	Put some of the Poké Beans you collect into the\nPoké Bean crate on the island, would you?\c\nThen they’ll be handy for any hungry Pokémon\nwandering around the island to eat anytime![VAR 0114(002F)]
186	Yup! That’s a Poké Bean crate right there!\nYou can drop Poké Beans in there, and the\r\nPokémon will love you for it.\c\nEspecially here on Isle Abeens. Leaving Poké\nBeans in the crate here can even tempt wild\r\nPokémon to come by for a gander and some fun.[VAR 0114(002F)]
187	Oh, yes! One more thing! The rarer kinds of\nPoké Beans will have their effects last longer.\r\nYou might want to remember that fact!\c\nBut as long as you fill the crate up, then you’ll\nprobably be A-OK. Don’t you worry!\c\nAnd if you ever want to talk to me about things,\nno need to feel shy.\r\nThere’s a button right there for my raft hut...\nLet’s push it![VAR 0114(002F)]
188	Wonderful to see you again!\nI’m delighted to welcome you to my raft hut!\c\nThis has been my own private castle ever since\nthat fateful day when I decided to turn these\r\nuninhabited islands into a resort for Pokémon.\c\nI built this place myself and it’s not too shabby,\nif I dare say so myself.\c\nI have everything I could need here to keep\nPoké Pelago up and running.[VAR 0114(002F)]
189	So, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nI’ve got a favor to ask of a promising Trainer\nlike yourself.\c\nPoké Pelago only features one small island at\nthe moment, as you’ve seen.\c\nIf you were to liken it to a Pokémon, it would be\na Lv. 1 babe just hatched from its Egg!\c\nSo I’d like you and your Pokémon to put some\neffort into developing the islands here![VAR 0114(002F)]

226	Looks like you’ve got more than 30 Pokémon\nin your PC Boxes now!\c\nYou’ll be needing more Poké Beans then.\nI guess I’ve got to work harder, too![VAR 0114(002F)]
227	Looks like you’ve got more than 90 Pokémon\nin your PC Boxes now!\c\nYou’ll be needing a lot of Poké Beans then!\nI guess I’ve got to work harder, too![VAR 0114(002F)]
228	Looks like you’ve got more than 150 Pokémon\nin your PC Boxes now!\c\nYou’ll be needing whole piles of Poké Beans!\nI guess I’ve got to work harder, too![VAR 0114(002F)]
229	Oh? Your Boxes are beginning to look a bit\nlonely with so few Pokémon in them now.\c\nI’d love to see a good 30 or so Pokémon tucked\nsafely away in them![VAR 0114(002F)]
230	Oh? Your Boxes are beginning to look a bit\nlonely with so few Pokémon in them now.\c\nI’d love to see a good 90 or so Pokémon tucked\nsafely away in them![VAR 0114(002F)]
231	Oh? Your Boxes are beginning to look a bit\nlonely with so few Pokémon in them now.\c\nI’d love to see a good 150 or so Pokémon\ntucked safely away in them![VAR 0114(002F)]
232	Welcome!\nYou’ve come to Poké Pelago!\c\nThese uninhabited islands exist solely for the\ndelight of Pokémon you’ve deposited in your\r\nPC Boxes.\c\nHmm? Hold the phone!\c\nYou don’t seem to have any Pokémon in your\nPC Boxes, now do you?\c\nWhy don’t you go catch a bunch of Pokémon\nand put some in your PC Boxes before you\r\ncome visit us again?[VAR 0114(002F)]
233	You’ve got everything you need to develop an\nisle for Poké Pelago! Did you know that?\c\nStop by my Raft Hut and check it out![VAR 0114(002F)]
234	[VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nWe’ve done it! Poké Pelago has been fully\ndeveloped into its final, perfect form!\c\nAnd it’s all thanks to you, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nThank you so much!\c\nI know this isn’t much, but I hope that you’ll\ntake it as an expression of my gratitude![VAR 0114(002F)]
235	[VAR BE05(0002)]You obtained 10 Rainbow Beans![VAR BE05(0003)][VAR 0114(002F)]

237	Oh! This’ll be your first Bean Bottle, won’t it?\c\nYes, a Bean Bottle is just what it sounds like:\na bottle that has Poké Beans in it.\c\nBean Bottles sometimes wash up to onto the\nshore here at these isles.\c\nThey must have been set adrift by someone\nelse out in this wide world, which is connected\r\nall over by the great oceans!\c\nPeople set these bottles adrift hoping that they\nmight bring some happiness to the person\r\nwho finds one!\c\nIt’s a pretty romantic idea, isn’t it?\nAnd that’s A-OK in my book![VAR 0114(002F)]
238	If you bring happiness to someone else, then\nmaybe something good will happen to you, too!\c\nThat’s why it never hurts to do something nice\nlike setting a Bean Bottle adrift in the ocean.\c\nBut you can only send out one Bean Bottle per\nday, I’m afraid.\c\nHappiness that can be bought cheaply might\nend up inviting unhappiness instead![VAR 0114(002F)]
239	Poké Beans can come in special varieties called\nPatterned Beans and Rainbow Beans.\c\nYou can sometimes find these rare Poké Beans\non Isle Abeens, if you’re lucky.\c\nThey are absolutely delicious, so your Pokémon\nwill be delighted if you feed one to them![VAR 0114(002F)]
240	In fact...I’ll let you in on a little secret.\nPatterned Beans and Rainbow Beans are in fact\r\nsome of my favorite foods, as well!\c\nThey have delightful flavor and just the right\namount of chew.\r\nOnce I start eating them, I can’t stop myself!\c\n... ... ...\c\nHey now, please don’t look at me like that...\c\nI’ve been working here managing Poké Pelago\nfor a very long time and it’s a really tough habit\r\nto break![VAR 0114(002F)]
241	OK!\nSo let’s trade some beans![VAR 0114(002F)]
242	[~ 242]
243	So you’ll help me! Thank you, thank you.\nAnd now that we have that settled...\c\nOK then! There are five isles total that you can\ndevelop here at Poké Pelago!\c\nEach one will require you to have a different\nnumber of Pokémon in your Boxes and\r\nPlain Beans in your coffers![VAR 0114(002F)]
244	Check what it says that you need to develop\neach isle in its summary, OK?\c\nOK then! If that’s all clear, you just tell me\nwhich isle you’d like to develop next![VAR 0114(002F)]
245	Anyway, you don’t need to worry yourself about\nmy diet. This is all you need to know:\c\nI’ll give you three Plain Beans for each\nPatterned Bean you offer me.\r\nAnd seven Plain Beans for each Rainbow Bean!\c\nSo what do you say to a little trade?[VAR 0114(002F)]
246	Looks like there’s no more space to plant any\nBerries in that field!\c\nWhy don’t you harvest some of your ripe Berries\nand free up a little space to plant in?[VAR 0114(002F)]
247	We’ve done it! It’s the perfect Poké Pelago\nI’ve always dreamed of! You’ve done it!\c\nOK!\nThis is fantastic!\c\nAnd it’s all thanks to you, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nThank you so much!\c\nPoké Pelago now belongs to you and your\nPokémon, I’d say!\c\nI hope you’ll continue to use it to great effect![VAR 0114(002F)]
248	It looks like it’s going to be a good long while\nuntil this Egg hatches.[VAR 0114(002F)]
249	Looks to me like you have plenty of Plain Beans.\nLet’s trade when your stores have gone down.[VAR 0114(002F)]
250	You’ve come at just the right time!\nThis Egg looks ready to hatch at any moment![VAR 0114(002F)]
251	You should add some Poké Beans after you’ve\nplanted a few Berries first![VAR 0114(002F)]
252	The Bean Bottle was sent adrift out to sea![VAR 0114(002F)]
253	Do you want to leave Poké Pelago?[VAR 0114(002F)]
254	OK!\nThen come back soon![VAR 0114(002F)]

6	Alola!\c\n[VAR 0101(0000)] and [VAR 0101(0001)] are doing\njust fine! They don’t seem to like playing\r\ntogether, though.
7	Oh hey!\c\nI have surprising news for you!\c\nYour Pokémon was holding an Egg!\c\nIt’s like a total mystery where it came from,\nbut you want the Egg your Pokémon was\r\nholding, right?
8	You received the Egg from the Pokémon\nNursery lady.
9	Please take good care of it!
10	Oh your party is full...\c\nPlease come back again after making space for\nthe Egg.
11	I’ll keep it if you don’t want it, but you want it,\ndon’t you?

18	If you leave the Pokémon with me, you won’t be\nable to battle.\c\nPlease come back again with more Pokémon.
19	Which Pokémon shall I take care of?

0	Hello there! You must be one of Ilima’s friends?
1	Come on in! Any friend to my son is a friend\nto me!
2	Just one thing, though.\c\nI’d like to hear what you think of my boy.\nIs he doing a good job as a captain?
3	He’s a good captain
4	I’m not really sure
5	Sorry. I probably shouldn’t have asked you\nsomething like that out of the blue...\c\nOur Ilima has just always been obsessed with\nPokémon battling, ever since he was a boy.\c\nHe’s like a different person when he\nbattles—you can see it in his eyes!\c\nI’ve always been a little worried about\nwhether he would do all right as a captain.
6	Sorry to hold you up.\nIf you’re looking for Ilima, he’s in his room.
7	Any friend of my son’s is welcome here.\nStay as long as you’d like.
8	Thank you for coming, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(000C)]
9	And you’ve arrived with such exquisite timing!\c\nI’ve been conducting research on battle planning\nfor quite some time, and at last my simulation\r\nis complete![VAR 0114(000C)]
10	Would you be so kind as to test it with\nme, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(000C)]
11	Not now
12	Sure
13	What a shame.\c\nPlease do let me know when you are available.[VAR 0114(000C)]
14	You have my gratitude.\c\nVery well then. To the Trainers’ School![VAR 0114(000C)]
15	Before we begin, allow me to explain...\c\nIt’s not battle results that interest me.\nRather, it’s the carefully-thought-out strategies\r\nor novel tactics employed by Trainers.\c\nHow those plans affect one’s opponent and\ninfluence the outcome of battles—that is where\r\nmy interest lies![VAR 0114(000C)]
16	Now give me everything you’ve\ngot, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(000C)]
17	Wonderful! What a truly wonderful battle!\c\nI’ll be feeling the aftershocks from that battle\nfor a long time to come. That was the best I\r\ncould’ve hoped for![VAR 0114(000C)]
18	The way that Ilima looked in that battle seems\nto linger in your mind...
19	Thank you.\c\nAllow me to treat you to some tea and snacks\nback in my room.[VAR 0114(000C)]
20	Will you be on your way then?\c\nAllow me to offer you this as payment for\nyour assistance.[VAR 0114(000C)]
21	When a Pokémon holds an Everstone, it will\nnot evolve.\c\nIt has other effects as well, but let’s set those\naside for now.\c\nMay our friendship last as long as an Everstone![VAR 0114(000C)]
22	I think I’ll begin analyzing our battle data.\c\nThere are so many amazing discoveries yet to\nbe made! Someday I hope to share them\r\nwith everyone![VAR 0114(000C)]

0	Who are you, [VAR 1100(00FF,0406)]misterlady?\nAre you one of Sissy’s friends?
1	It’s a stranger!\nWho are you? Who are you?
2	Wow!\nAn island challenge amulet!
3	Sissy isn’t here!\nBut I think she’s coming home, soon.
4	Play with us till Sissy comes home!
5	OK
6	What?
7	Then I wanna have a battle!\nLet’s do a moldy battle!
8	Meanie! Big, stinky meanie!\nCome on, play with us!
9	It’s not a moldy battle!\nIt’s a Multi Battle! We’ll have a Multi Battle!
10	Yeah, that. So what do you say?\nYou ready, M[VAR 1100(00FF,0F0D)]r. Trainer guiss Trainer lady?
11	You’re on!
12	Not yet
13	Come on!\nHurry up and get ready already!
14	Come on!\nYou can’t fight without enough Pokémon!
15	Wowzers!\nYou are sure strong, M[VAR 1100(00FF,0F0D)]r. Trainer guiss Trainer lady!
16	You might even be stronger than Sissy!
17	I’m home, girls.[VAR 0114(000D)]
18	Sissy!
19	Welcome home!
20	Oh! [VAR 0100(0000)]?\nYou came to visit with us?[VAR 0114(000D)]
21	M[VAR 1100(00FF,0F0D)]r. Trainer guiss Trainer lady was playing with us!
22	[VAR 1100(00FF,0201)]HShe is really strong. Did you know that?
23	Well, thank you, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nFor entertaining my little sisters so kindly.[VAR 0114(000D)]
24	Hey, Sissy! Sissy!
25	Who’s probably stronger? You or this Trainer?\nLike, if you were REALLY trying?
26	Yeah, who?
27	Who’s stronger? Are you stronger?
28	Well... I don’t rightly know.\n[VAR 0100(0000)] is definitely strong h[VAR 1100(0000,0202)]imerself.[VAR 0114(000D)]
29	But we wanna know who’s stronger!
30	Battle h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer!
31	It looks like I’ve got little choice...\c\nOnce the girls have their minds set, they don’t\nbudge, no matter how hard you try.[VAR 0114(000D)]
32	Come on! Do it!
33	Battle! Battle!
34	If you don’t mind, [VAR 0100(0000)], could I ask\nyou for a battle?\c\nI’ve spent quite some time devising a way to\ndefeat you, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(000D)]
35	Sure!
36	Umm...
37	I know these girls would love to see us battle,\nso please come back anytime to take me on.\c\nAnd perhaps I should warn you...\nI don’t bother with small fries or losing battles.\r\nI plan to haul in a big catch when we fight![VAR 0114(000D)]
38	All right!
39	We knew you would do it!
40	Why don’t we go out front, [VAR 0100(0000)]?\c\nI would have some advantage battling inside\nthe house, since I’m so familiar with the layout.[VAR 0114(000D)]
41	Go on! Beat h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer, Sissy!
42	Show h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer what you’ve got!
43	Shall we?[VAR 0114(000D)]
44	I have a responsibility to set a good example\nfor my younger sisters, of course.\c\nBut even more important than that...I have my\npride as a captain!\c\nI will show you what a serious Lana can do![VAR 0114(000D)]
45	I look forward to enjoying a no-holds-barred\nbattle again you, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(000D)]
46	Phew...[VAR 0114(000D)]
47	No way! She lost!\nSissy actually lost!
48	That’s amazing!\nM[VAR 1100(00FF,0F0D)]r. Trainer guiss Trainer lady is amazing!
49	[VAR 0100(0000)], that was fantastic!\nYou and your Pokémon were perfectly in sync!\c\nIt seems I was still premature in thinking that\nmy full power would be enough to defeat you.[VAR 0114(000D)]
50	The way that Lana looked in that battle seems\nto linger in your mind...
51	How boring! I can’t believe Sissy lost!\nPoo. I’m going home.
52	Me, too!\nGimme a piggyback ride!
53	Fine, fine...\nLet’s all be getting back home.\c\nBut I will not be carrying you!\nYou can walk on your own two feet.\r\nWhat else do you think you have feet for?[VAR 0114(000D)]
54	Thank you again for playing with my sisters.\c\nHere...why don’t you take these?\nYou might want to give them to a Clamperl.[VAR 0114(000D)]
55	My father is expecting me to help on the boat,\nso I should be going soon.\c\nBut you feel free to stay as long as you want,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]. My home is yours.[VAR 0114(000D)]
56	Hey, strong M[VAR 1100(00FF,0F0D)]r. Trainer guiss Trainer lady!
57	Hiya, M[VAR 1100(00FF,0F0D)]r. Trainer guiss Trainer lady!
513
0	Hey, [VAR 0100(0000)]! What’s up?[VAR 0114(000E)]
1	I came to play with you!
2	I’m here for a battle!
3	All right, let’s do it!\c\nOf course if two Trainers are going to play, it’s\ngotta be a Pokémon battle, right?\c\nYup, it’s decided! I guess we should head to\nLush Jungle.\c\nLet’s make this like a little treasure hunt. Come\nfind me where the Wimpod is! Don’t be late![VAR 0114(000E)]
4	Mallow! Can you give me a hand?
5	Huh? Where’s Mallow?
6	In the jungle
7	She’s not here
8	At this hour? That’s not like her...\c\nbut now I’m in a jam. I was going to ask her to\ngo do some shopping for me.
9	If you see her, can you tell her something\nfor me?\c\nTell her to bring my Wimpod with her when\nshe comes home.
10	Oh, you made it![VAR 0114(000E)]
11	Wimpod is in my big brother’s party.[VAR 0114(000E)]
12	Wi-wim!
13	It’s out here gathering ingredients for\nour restaurant![VAR 0114(000E)]
14	Wi-wim-wim!
15	You’ve got all the ingredients you need for a\ndelicious battle, right?[VAR 0114(000E)]
16	Let’s do this!
17	Gimme a minute...
18	Oh really? Well come back and tell me when\nyou’re ready![VAR 0114(000E)]
19	Time for you to see that I can do more than\njust cook![VAR 0114(000E)]
20	That battle was a piece of cake for you, wasn’t\nit? I should’ve known—you did clear my trial,\r\nafter all!\c\nAs your captain, I am very proud of you, though![VAR 0114(000E)]
21	The way that Mallow looked in that battle\nseems to linger in your mind...
22	There’s no doubt in my mind that you’ll go on to\nbe an amazing Trainer!\c\nLike, you could even be a kahuna someday![VAR 0114(000E)]
23	There’s no doubt in my mind that you’ll go on to\nbe an amazing Trainer!\c\nLike, you could even be a kahuna someday![VAR 0114(000E)]
24	Do you ever think about the\nfuture, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(000E)]
25	I do
26	Nope
27	Oh, I see. Well, I’ve got my future all planned out!\c\nI mean, we have to move on from being captains\nwhen we turn 20 anyway.\c\nIt may be ordinary, but I’m hoping to take over\nmy family’s restaurant.\c\nI think I could be an even better chef than my\ndad and big brother one day![VAR 0114(000E)]
28	Huh? What’s up?\c\nIs it something about my big brother?[VAR 0114(000E)]
29	He had a favor to ask...
30	He told me to tell you...
31	Sorry, [VAR 0100(0000)]! I’ve gotta get back!\c\nCome on, Wimpod. You, too! Big brother’s\nwaiting for us![VAR 0114(000E)]
32	Wi-wi-wi-wim!
33	It’s been fun, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nSee you later! Bye![VAR 0114(000E)]

0	Yah! Hoo! Hee! Hyah![VAR 0114(000F)]
1	Huhn?[VAR 0114(000F)]
2	Oh. It’s you, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(000F)]
3	What are you doing?
4	What was that all about?
5	This is my fire dance training.[VAR 0114(000F)]
6	This is my torch staff.\c\nWhen I’m actually performing fire dances, I’ll light\nit on fire.[VAR 0114(000F)]
7	Whenever I have free time, I practice my dance\nas much as I can.\c\nIt takes a lot of repetition to get good at it...just\nlike Pokémon battles.[VAR 0114(000F)]
8	Oh, look at the time![VAR 0114(000F)]
9	Sorry, I know you just got here, but I have to go\nto the Thrifty Megamart.\c\nIf you need to talk to me, come meet me there.[VAR 0114(000F)]
10	I see...[VAR 0114(000F)]
11	Kiawe, I’m really terribly sorry about this, but\nI’ve thought long and hard about this decision.\c\nIf it comes down to people who are counting on\nthis job to make a living, and you...
12	It’s all right.\c\nI know how hard you’ve worked to open this\nlocation after the guardian deity destroyed the\r\nprevious one in anger.\c\nI understand, boss.[VAR 0114(000F)]
13	Kiawe...\c\nI’ve given you as much as I can afford. Spend\nyour final paycheck wisely.
14	Thank you very much.[VAR 0114(000F)]
15	I hope your dream of studying dance abroad\ncomes true someday.\c\nI have to keep working hard here to make my\ndreams for the Thrifty Megamart come true.
16	It’s OK, boss. You can head back in now.[VAR 0114(000F)]
17	Thank you. I’ll be seeing you.
18	How could this happen...?[VAR 0114(000F)]
19	Oh, it’s you, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(000F)]
20	If you don’t mind, I’d like to battle\nyou, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(000F)]
21	Of course
22	Just a minute
23	I see... I’ll be waiting for you here, then.[VAR 0114(000F)]
24	I don’t feel like dancing by myself right now...[VAR 0114(000F)]
25	So strong...\c\nI should’ve known. You did clear my trial,\nafter all.\c\nBy the way, did you overhear what we were\njust talking about?[VAR 0114(000F)]
26	What are you talking about?
27	Yeah, kind of...
28	You’re too considerate, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(000F)]
29	Yes, of course you did...[VAR 0114(000F)]
30	My dream is to become a professional\nfire dancer.\c\nI’ve been saving up forever to go study\ndance abroad.\c\nBut I was just laid off from my part-time job. It\nseems like nothing ever goes right...[VAR 0114(000F)]
31	Sorry.\c\nI didn’t mean to trouble you with my\nproblems, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nYou’re so easy to talk to, though. I feel much\nbetter after talking with you.\r\nThank you for being there.\c\nI’ll be going then.\nUntil we meet again, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(000F)]
32	The way that Kiawe looked in that battle seems\nto linger in your mind...

19	[VAR 0100(0000)], allow me to handle this foolish\nyoung man.\c\nI will make a fine Trainer out of him yet, or I’m\nnot an island kahuna!\c\nI hope that can be considered penance for the\nwrongs he and Team Skull have committed.[VAR 0114(0008)]
20	Tch![VAR 0114(0017)]
21	Oh ho ho! The two of us will go many\nplaces together!\c\nAnd we will meet more people and Pokémon who\nwill enrich our lives.[VAR 0114(0008)]
22	Master...[VAR 0114(0017)]
23	I ain’t never gonna ask you to forgive me,\nso don’t get it twisted—this is no apology!\c\nBut shut up and take this! I got it for my\nfirst-ever victory so I’d never lose my grip,\r\nand it’s always been like my lucky charm![VAR 0114(0017)]
24	Who knows what the Alolan winds will bring?\c\nNext time we meet, I’m counting on you to test\nhow strong I’ve gotten.[VAR 0114(0017)]

0	Would you look at that [VAR 0101(0001)]!
1	I think it can still put out a bit more effort!
2	It’s clearly put out a great deal of effort!\c\nWhy don’t you pin this ribbon on it so that it\nfeels rewarded for all that hard effort?
3	You received an Effort Ribbon!
4	You put the Effort Ribbon on [VAR 0101(0001)]!
5	Now, now, look at that! I’d say that Effort\nRibbon goes perfectly with [VAR 0101(0001)]!
6	Would you like to show me how much your\nPokémon have grown since joining your team?
7	Oh? Well, that is too bad...
8	Which Pokémon will you show me, then?
9	Ho! This is a hard one...
10	Hm? It’s rather hard to judge how well you’ve\nraised an Egg, you know.
11	Oh! It looks like this [VAR 0101(0001)] was only...\nLv. [VAR 0202(0002)] when you first met!\r\nAnd now it’s Lv. [VAR 0202(0003)]!
12	That is some amazing growth.\nI can feel your deep love for your Pokémon.
13	That’s some decent growth, all right.\nYou’ve been real decent to it.
14	That’s no different at all!\c\nI hope you’ll continue your journey so that you\nboth can grow a whole lot together.
15	How do you grow together?\nBy walking the same path with someone else.\c\nLet me give you this as a reward for showing\nme how far you two have come along together.
16	You received a Footprint Ribbon!
17	You put the Footprint Ribbon on\n[VAR 0101(0001)]!
18	Your love leaves its marks as surely as your\npassing leaves your footprints upon the sand...\c\nI’m grateful that you were willing to show me\nthe wonderful bond between you and your team.
19	The path that you’ve walked together with\n[VAR 0101(0001)] is perfectly easy for me to see,\r\nthanks to that glittering Footprint Ribbon there!
20	Oh! Your [VAR 0101(0000)]!
21	I guess maybe you’ll show it some affection\nsoon, huh?
22	It’s starting to look like it likes you!
23	You’ve been showing it some affection, huh?\nYou two are looking good!
24	You two look like great friends!\nYou must play with it a whole lot, huh?
25	You’ve got to be some of the most affectionate\nfriends I’ve ever seen! I think I’m jealous!
26	[VAR 0101(0001)] got a Best Friends Ribbon!
27	I hope you’ll stay friends forever and ever!\nAnd ever and ever!
28	You’re the best friends ever, aren’t you!\c\nNo wonder your Pokémon is wearing that\nBest Friends Ribbon!
29	Ribbons...\c\nThey’re like a way to wrap your Pokémon up in\nprecious memories for perpetuity.\c\nI’ve heard that there are a lot of different kinds\nof ribbons in other regions, outside of Alola.

0	Hello!\nYou’re a local, aren’t you?\c\nI’ve got a favor I want to ask someone like you!\nPlease, you’ve gotta help me!
1	All right
2	Not now
3	What?! Oh, come on!\nDon’t be so cold! Where’s your Alola spirit?!
4	Oh, thanks, kid!\nThat’s the Alola spirit! You’re all so nice here!\c\nI’m actually here on my honeymoon, and my\nbeautiful bride has completely fallen for this\r\nPokémon you have here called [VAR FF00(0001)]Sableye[VAR FF00(0000)]!\c\nI’ve heard that Sableye get along with Carbink,\nwhich live in Ten Carat Hill.
5	Could you catch a Sableye for me in Ten\nCarat Hill?\c\nIf you do, I can check out its information in your\n’Dex, and then I can go catch one myself!\c\nI’ll even pay you for your hassle.\nThink of it as a bit of part-time work, OK?
6	It’s a Pokémon called [VAR FF00(0001)]Sableye[VAR FF00(0000)].\c\nI’ve heard that Sableye get along with Carbink,\nwhich live in Ten Carat Hill.
7	Oh! You’ve caught a Sableye!\nLet me see your ’Dex for a second!
8	Mm-hmm... I see...\c\nIts eyes turned into jewels as it ate jewels.\c\nWhat?! Does it mean Sableye eat Carbink?\nHahaha. It can’t be.
9	All right. Thanks for this, pal!\nNow I’ll go and try to catch one for myself.\c\nHere. It’s not much, but here’s your pay.\nYou’ve earned it!
10	All right... Now it’s time that I set out to find\na Sableye of my own for my beautiful bride!
11	Hey, you’re a Trainer, aren’t you?\c\nDo me a favor.
12	Sure
13	Not now
14	Hey! You’re too much in a hurry!
15	Well, I’m pretty relaxed and laid-back.\c\nA bit too relaxed, actually... I may be wasting\nmy life...\c\nSo I want to learn a more speedy way of life\nfrom a Pokémon.
16	I’ve heard that there is a Pokémon called [VAR FF00(0001)]Abra\n[VAR FF00(0000)]in the tall grass in Hau’oli City.\c\nWill you catch one for me and register it in\nyour Pokédex?\c\nI’ve heard that it’s so speedy that it runs away\ninstantly, though.\c\nIf you keep your word and find one for me, then\nI’ll even pay you for the trouble, OK?
17	What I want is a Pokémon called [VAR FF00(0001)]Abra[VAR FF00(0000)] from the\ntall grass in Hau’oli City!\c\nOne way to catch a Pokémon that is quick to\nflee may be throwing a Poké Ball right away.
18	You’ve caught that Abra?\nWell then, show me your Pokédex!
19	It sleeps 18 hours a day?!\nAnd it’ll teleport itself while sleeping?!\c\nOh, no. This won’t work. Life is short.\nSleeping most of the time is such a waste.
20	But...it would be nice to be able to move fast\nwhile relaxing and sleeping.\c\nSo here is your pay for the work you did.
21	I’ll enjoy my life to the fullest while relaxing!
22	Hey, have you got a moment?\nYou live here in Alola, right?\c\nI’ve got a favor I’d like to ask. Do you mind?
23	No problem
24	Not now
25	Oh... Sorry, then.
26	Wow, thank you! I’m so glad that you would\nlisten to a request from a total stranger like me.\c\nI’m actually here in Alola with my darling hubby.\nIt’s our honeymoon!\c\nWhen we were looking for Berries, we saw this\nPokémon called [VAR FF00(0001)]Crabrawler[VAR FF00(0000)].\c\nMy darling hubby fell in love at first sight\nwith Crabrawler...
27	Anyway, I wanted to ask if you could catch\none of those Crabrawler for me.\c\nIf I know what kind of Pokémon it is, then I can\nprobably go and catch one myself.\c\nYou may be able to find Crabrawler in a pile of\nfallen Berries.\c\nIf you catch one and come back to show me its\nPokédex entry, I can pay you for your trouble!
28	I heard that [VAR FF00(0001)]Crabrawler[VAR FF00(0000)] love Berries and\ngather under trees.
29	What? You’ve caught Crabrawler?\nThen would you mind showing me your ’Dex?
30	They fight over their favorite Berries and punch\neach other... I see...
31	Actually, I want to get one of these Crabrawler\nfor myself now!\c\nLet me at least pay you like I promised first.\nThis is a little token of my appreciation.
32	Thank you, young Trainer!\nI’ll go look for some Crabrawler at once!
33	You there!\nI have a favor to ask you...
34	Sure
35	Not now
36	Oh, well. OK!
37	Seriously?\nWoo-hoo! Thanks!\c\nActually, I’m a fashion designer, and there is a\nPokémon that I want to get inspiration from\r\nfor my new collection.
38	The contrast between the black and pink...\nIt’s so seriously cool...\c\nThat’s why I want you to catch a [VAR FF00(0001)]Salazzle[VAR FF00(0000)] and\nregister it in your Pokédex!\c\nOf course, I’ll give you tons of money!\nI’m counting on you!
39	Come to think of it, I’ve never seen\nmale [VAR FF00(0001)]Salazzle[VAR FF00(0000)]...\c\nYou can find both male and female Salandit in\nWela Volcano Park, though.
40	You’ve caught a Salazzle?!\nLet me see it! Hand over that Pokédex!
41	Hah... It punishes Salandit that fail to gather\nfood by slapping them!\c\nI like it. Its strength and harshness...\nSalazzle is the inspiration my design needed!
42	Thanks!\nThis is for you as I promised.
43	Thanks to you, more and more ideas are pouring\nout of me! My new collection will be awesome!
44	Um...excuse me, but...could I ask you something?
45	Sure
46	Not now
47	Oh, I see...\nSorry to bother you then...
48	Thank you for giving me some of your time.\c\nI’m currently researching a Pokémon called\n[VAR FF00(0001)]Corsola[VAR FF00(0000)], but I’m terrible at fishing, and so\r\nI’m not making any progress at all...
49	Do you think I could offer you a bit of part-time\nwork as a research assistant?\c\nCould you try to catch a Corsola for me?\c\nIf you manage to catch one, please come and\nshow me your Pokédex data. I have enough\r\nin the budget to pay you, so please!
50	I need to see a [VAR FF00(0001)]Corsola[VAR FF00(0000)].\nPlease...help me out...
51	You’ve caught the Corsola?\nThen will you show me your Pokédex?
52	So there it is...\c\nCorsola’s coral branches are short because\nMareanie attack Corsola...\c\nI’m relieved that it doesn’t cause any pain to\nCorsola, but, wow...nature is harsh!
53	Thank you. You’ve been a great help!\nHere. For your assistance.
54	You’ve been a great help with my research.\nNow I should be able to make some progress!
55	Why, hello, Trainer.\nLooks like you’ve got a Pokédex on you.\c\nHow would you like to do a little part-time work\non behalf of the Aether Foundation?
56	Sure
57	Not now
58	Well, that is a shame.\nCome back if you ever have the time.
59	We at the Aether Foundation work to protect\nPokémon through conservation.\c\nRight now, we are surveying the [VAR FF00(0001)]Goomy [VAR FF00(0000)]that\nlive in Lush Jungle.\c\nThe foundation is collecting its own data, of\ncourse, but we would also like to know what\r\ndata the Pokédex records about them.
60	So your job, if you should choose to accept it,\nwould be to register Goomy in your Pokédex\r\nand then show us the data.\c\nWe will pay you for the work, of course.\nI hope you’ll help us out.
61	Please show us the data that your Pokédex\nrecords about the [VAR FF00(0001)]Goomy[VAR FF00(0000)] living in Lush Jungle.\c\nThey seem to appear during SOS battles...and\nwon’t appear unless it’s raining...
62	You’ve caught a Goomy?\nThen would you show me your Pokédex?
63	I see... Because most of the body is water, it\nappears only during the rain so that it won’t\r\ndry out.\c\nThe biology of this Goomy is one that we hadn’t\nyet uncovered in our own research...\c\nThis is just the level of detail that I knew we\ncould expect from the Pokédex!
64	Thank you very much!\nHere is your pay.
65	Thank you for helping us with our research.\c\nI think we’ll have an even better understanding\nof Goomy thanks to this.
66	Whooooa! You have a Rotom Dex!\c\nI have a perfect job for you!\nPlease help me!
67	Sure
68	Not now
69	Wha-a-at?!\nOh, well...too bad...
70	I’m an employee of the Aether Foundation.\c\nWe’re doing a survey right now of a Pokémon\ncalled [VAR FF00(0001)]Natu[VAR FF00(0000)], but I’ve had no luck finding any\r\nof them, and I’m in a real tough spot now...
71	If you happen to catch a Natu, would you\nshow me the data from your Pokédex?\c\nIf you help me out, I can pay you for your work!
72	[VAR FF00(0001)]Natu[VAR FF00(0000)] live in the Akala Outskirts.\c\nAccording to reports, they are often seen in\nthe morning.
73	You caught a Natu?\nThen I’ll have a look at your ’Dex.
74	So, that’s it... They can’t fly, but they can jump\nreally high...\c\nThere must be a reason why they appear only\nin the morning, too.\c\nI guess there are things that we can’t learn\nfrom the Aether Foundation’s data alone...
75	I appreciate your cooperation.\nHere, this is for you!
76	Thanks to you, we’ll know more about the\nbiology of Natu.\c\nI truly appreciate your cooperation with the\nAether Foundation!
77	Whooooa! You have a Rotom Dex!\c\nI have a perfect job for you!\nPlease help me!
78	Sure
79	Not now
80	Wha-a-at?!\nOh, well...too bad...
81	I’m an employee of the Aether Foundation.\c\nWe’re doing a survey right now of a Pokémon\ncalled [VAR FF00(0001)]Hoothoot[VAR FF00(0000)], but I’ve had no luck finding\r\nany of them, and I’m in a real tough spot now...
82	If you happen to catch a Hoothoot, would you\nshow me the data from your Pokédex?\c\nIf you help me out, I can pay you for your work!
83	[VAR FF00(0001)]Hoothoot[VAR FF00(0000)] live in Lush Jungle.\c\nAccording to reports, they are seen often\nduring the night.
84	You caught a Hoothoot?\nThen I’ll have a look at your ’Dex.
85	So, that’s it... People in ancient times used\nHoothoot as a clock.\c\nThere must be a reason why they appear only\nduring the night, too.\c\nI guess there are things that we can’t learn\nfrom the Aether Foundation’s data...
86	Thanks for your research! Here, this is for you!
87	Thanks to you, we’ll know more about the\nbiology of Hoothoot.\c\nI truly appreciate your cooperation with the\nAether Foundation!
88	Um, could I borrow a moment of your time?\nJust a moment, mind you.
89	Sure
90	Not now
91	O-oh... Of course. You’re busy.\nHow silly of me to try talking to you...
92	Th-thank you very much.\c\nYou see...I’ve fallen in love at first sight!\nWith a Pokémon called [VAR FF00(0001)]Minior[VAR FF00(0000)]!\c\nI love it to bits... I love it so much that I can’t\nbear to even catch one for myself!\c\nSo I wanted to ask a favor...\nCould you catch a Minior for me and then\r\nshow me its Pokédex entry so I can see it?
93	I think you’ll find some adorable Minior\naround the observatory.\c\nThey look like meteorites, so I’m sure you’ll know\nas soon as you see one.
94	Of course, I’ll pay you for your trouble.\nPlease find an adorable [VAR FF00(0001)]Minior[VAR FF00(0000)]!
95	What?! You actually caught a Minior?!\nThe Pokédex! Give it here! At once!
96	Oooh... My little Minior...\nHow adorable you are...\c\nThe beautiful core wrapped in that hard shell...\nIt’s so very dreamy...
97	Oh! This is the best! Just wonderful!\nHere is your payment, as promised!
98	I got to know my beloved Minior even better\nthan before!\c\nThank you for this! Have a wonderful journey!
99	You’re a Pokémon Trainer, right?\nWanna do a little job for me?
100	Sure
101	Not now
102	Hmph. Fine then.\nIf you change your mind, though, come see me.
103	I’m looking for information about a Pokémon\ncalled [VAR FF00(0001)]Garchomp[VAR FF00(0000)].\c\nSo I want you to catch a Garchomp and show\nme the data that your Pokédex records for it.
104	People say they saw it in Haina Desert, but\nI haven’t been able to find it.\c\nSo go find one for me. If you do a good job,\nI’ll even pay you for the trouble.
105	My coworker told me that Gabite sometimes\ngets called into battles as an ally when there\r\nis a sandstorm raging...\c\nBut why just Gabite?\nWhat I want is a [VAR FF00(0001)]Garchomp[VAR FF00(0000)].
106	Caught a Garchomp?\nThat’s awesome! Show me your ’Dex!
107	...I knew it! Just trying to find it wouldn’t work!\c\nYou have to evolve a Gabite that appeared in an\nSOS battle into a Garchomp...\c\nI’m so glad that I asked you for help!\nThis is my job, but to be honest, it’s hard.\c\nI’ll copy the data in your ’Dex and report it\nto my boss...
108	Thanks a bunch, pal.\nNow I won’t get chewed out by my boss.\c\nTake your payment. No need to be shy about it.
109	I joined the Aether Foundation ’cause I thought\nthe white uniforms were really cool looking, but...\c\nPokémon conservation and all is actually a lot\nmore hard work than I expected... I sometimes\r\neven get bitten by Pokémon...\r\nIt’s no good just following a whim, you know?

20	And now...I think I’ll see myself out.
21	Fare thee well!
22	Hm...?\c\n... ... ...
23	That Pokémon you journey with...\nIt is Sol...\r\nSolgaleo?
24	That Pokémon you journey with...\nIt is Luna...\r\nLunala?
25	No... That’s not it...\nIt’s all wrong...
26	Where is it?\nThe Pokémon that always protected me?\r\nThat round body... That rugged form...\r\nThose sharp, burning eyes...
27	Where is it?\nThe Pokémon that always held me close?\r\nThat curved body... That perfect arc...\r\nComing to the most exquisite points...
28	If only I could see it once more...\nI think...I might remember something...

6	But you don’t even have that much!\nAnd I’m not lowering the price, either.

17	Your team really is fantastic, isn’t it?\c\nJust reeling off your team’s names makes my\nheart squeeze with joy!
18	I feel so alone...

0	I’ve been waiting for you!\c\nNow let me explain about the Reassembly Unit.[VAR 0114(0026)]
1	Sina...\nYou don’t waste even a second.[VAR 0114(0027)]
2	Have you been collecting Zygarde’s Cells\nand Cores?[VAR 0114(0026)]
3	You’ve collected fewer than 10 Cells\nand Cores combined...[VAR 0114(0027)]
4	You’ve collected 10 or more Cells\nand Cores combined.[VAR 0114(0027)]
5	Anyway, I’ll explain![VAR 0114(0026)]
6	The Reassembly Unit is a device that has\nsomething to do with the Pokémon Zygarde.\c\nThe machine is capable of assembly and\nseparation of Zygarde.[VAR 0114(0026)]
7	Assembly is...to create a Pokémon\ncalled Zygarde!\c\nNow, Dexio, it’s your turn.[VAR 0114(0026)]
8	Oh...Sina, Sina, Sina...\nAnyway...\c\nThere are two ways to assemble Zygarde.\c\nOne is to add Cells you collected\nto Zygarde.[VAR 0114(0027)]
9	The other is to create a new Zygarde with\nonly Cells![VAR 0114(0026)]
10	Next we’ll explain about separation.[VAR 0114(0027)]
11	To separate Zygarde...\nit means to return Zygarde to its Cells![VAR 0114(0026)]
12	Separated Cells will be returned to the\nZygarde Cube.[VAR 0114(0027)]
13	For your information, according to the research\nby the professor who’s sent us to Alola,\r\nZygarde is divided into 100 Cells and Cores.[VAR 0114(0027)]
14	Depending on the number of Cells and Cores,\nthe shape of Zygarde will be different...\r\nIn other words, Zygarde changes its Forme![VAR 0114(0026)]
15	Zygarde is said to maintain the order of the\nKalos region...then why is it in Alola...?\c\nIs it a sign that something is about to happen?[VAR 0114(0027)]
16	If you collect Zygarde’s Cells and Cores, you\nmay get the answer. Anyhow...\c\nwe’ll be taking our leave now!\nBon voyage![VAR 0114(0026)]

0	Welcome to the Trainers’ School!\nI’m the principal.
1	What an honor for me and the school!\c\nTo think that our teachings would not only give\nrise to a captain but to a League Champion!
2	Despite your lofty accomplishments, though, I’d\nhazard that you still don’t know everything that\r\nthe Trainer School has to teach you, eh?\c\nThen allow me to give you a special, expert\nlesson from the principal herself!
3	Just as the saying goes, even the fool may\ngive the wise man good counsel if he listens.\c\nI may have lost, but heed my advice and use\nthis. It is one of my favorite items.
4	If your Pokémon is holding the King’s Rock, its\nattacks may make an opponent flinch.\c\nAnd that’s the end of what I can teach you.\nI’m glad I was able to meet you here.
5	If I can defeat h[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer, then that will mean that our\nschool’s principal is stronger than a Champion.\c\nAnd even if I lose, we can still boast that we’re\nthe school who helped create a Champion.\c\nOh, it’s too good! It’s just too good! Ho ho ho!\nI can’t wipe this stupid grin off my face!
6	Urk. Nothing. I didn’t say anything.

98	After consulting with my stomach,\nit seems that we’re fated to battle!
99	[~ 99]
100	What should I eat next?\nLet me know, stomach...
101	The food of commoners always looks so quaint.\c\nWo-wonderful!
102	You seem to have your eye on it, so it must be\ngood commoner food.\c\nI’ll be taking my share—all of it!

105	*slurp*
106	Heh. Looks tasty, doesn’t it? That’s because I\nmade it all!\c\nI take the responsibility of tasting everything\nvery seriously!
107	[~ 107]
108	I became a Cook because I love food, but all I do\nis cook, not eat! It’s really frustrating...
109	What sort of cuisine do they serve here?
110	Ooh, so before we partake of the main course,\nwe can start off with an appetizer of a\r\nPokémon battle!
111	[~ 111]
112	There are many kinds of cuisine in the world.
113	Hi-yah! I need all the nutrients I can get\nbefore I head to the mountains for my training!
114	You have to fight if you want to eat! In other\nwords, welcome to the Battle Buffet!
115	[~ 115]
116	The sadness of being unable to eat what I want\nis intense. If I can get over it, I’ll become\r\neven stronger!
117	Strong Trainers gather to eat popular dishes...\nThis is going to take some skills!
118	I’m normally just a Pokémon Breeder!\c\nHere at the buffet I become a warrior loyal only\nto my appetite!
119	[~ 119]
120	I’m the type who gets all excited when\nI’m hungry.
121	Eating is truly the greatest pleasure we have\nin life! You’ll understand when you get older.
122	I feel like if I can just eat this delicious food,\nmy meeting will go better!
123	[~ 123]
124	Ah, who cares about my boss?\c\nIf I don’t get something good to eat,\nI don’t think I can take it anymore!
125	Don’t worry about me. I’m just looking.\nNo, really, I’m just looking.
126	Hang on a second! I can’t help it!\nI do want to eat after all!
127	[~ 127]
128	What do you think of girls who eat a lot?
129	Only the strong can eat! Muwuhahaha!\nSounds like my kind of place!
130	Your food is my food now!\nAnd I’m about to devour my food!
131	[~ 131]
132	No food for the weak...\nAnd I thought this was my kind of place...
133	I’m gonna fill up on some tasty food.\nIt might be tough...
134	What do you think you’re doing?!\c\nI saw it first! You think I’m\ngonna just let you take it?!
135	[~ 135]
136	They always have plenty of\ndishes no one likes left over...
137	I’m no Youngster!\nI’m a starving monster!
138	My favorite things, huh? That’s easy!\nTasty treats and Pokémon battles!
139	[~ 139]
140	I guess Youngsters can’t\nactually become monsters...
141	The law of the jungle is the only rule here\nat the Battle Buffet!
142	Hey, stop that! That’s mine!\nI told you, it’s the law of the jungle!
143	[~ 143]
144	I thought it had something\nto do with a jungle gym...
145	For this amount of food...\nand these ingredients...\c\nLet me see...\nAccording to my calculations...
146	OK! This dish will be indispensable\nif I want to get my money’s worth!
147	[~ 147]
148	What a fool I was...\nCalories had nothing to do with it...
149	I like this tense atmosphere.\c\nTo eat is to live, so everyone here is so serious.
150	Hey, if you can beat me,\ndo you want me to feed you?
151	[~ 151]
152	Open up, here it comes!
153	I can keep going.\nI can still eat more...\c\nI’ve got to eat a ton to make this worth it!
154	Whether you get to eat or not,\nit’s $1,200!\c\nIf that’s the case, I’ve got no choice but to eat!
155	[~ 155]
156	Your Pokémon and your appetite sure\nare healthy!

0	Hello, darling...\c\nI brought you some flowers today.
1	Hyah!
2	Hyah! Hyah!
3	...What do you think, darling?\nThey are lovely, aren’t they?
4	Hyah! Hiii-yah!\nHyah! Hyah!
5	Shhh, quiet now.\c\nThere are many others resting in these plots.
6	Hiii-yah! Hyah hyah hyah!
7	Come now, dry those tears.\nWe’re all done with tears, aren’t we? You and I.\c\nIf we come here, we can see him again any\ntime that we want to.\c\nAnd as long as we don’t forget him, he will\nalways be with us...
8	Hyah...
9	Hyah?!
10	Oh! Hello, young Trainer.\nI’m sorry for all of this one’s noise.
11	Hyah!
12	This is my husband’s grave.\nAnd this silly one here was his Pokémon.
13	Hyah! Hyah! Hiiii-yah!
14	It was...an accident.\c\nBut my husband sent Machamp back into its\nball at the moment of the crash.\r\nIt was a miracle that Machamp survived.\r\nBut my husband...\c\nWell, ever since the accident, Machamp here\nhas hated being inside a Poké Ball.\r\nIn fact it flung its own ball off somewhere.
15	Hi-yaaaaaahhh!
16	Of course I was devastated when my husband\npassed away.\c\nAnd there were times when I hated that other\nman, who caused the accident.\c\nBut that man...\nHe had a family, too. A young wife.\c\nWhen I saw her face, I just couldn’t go on hating\nanyone for what happened.
17	Oh, I’m sorry...\nI didn’t mean to say all that...
18	Thank you for letting an old woman ramble so.\c\nThis belonged to my husband, but I’d be happy\nif you could use it.
19	Do you also use Ride Pokémon to get around?\c\nIt is fun and quite convenient, but please do\nbe careful not to get in any accidents.\c\nTake care, young Trainer.
20	Good night for today, darling...\nWe’ll come visit again tomorrow night.

0	This Pokémon...has relatively superior...\n*ya-a-awn*
1	...Who are you?
2	No one impressive enough to shock me awake.\n*ya-a-awn*
3	Someone impressive enough to shock me awake!\n
4	Was there something you wanted my help with?\nOh, you want me to judge some Pokémon?
5	Then I’ll update your PC Boxes for you.\c\nWith this, you can get your Pokémon judged\nanytime that you’ve got access to a PC!
6	The Judge function has been added to your\nPC Boxes!
7	Think I’ll just slip out of here then...
534
0	Are you out and about on your island challenge?\nWhen you’ve completed it, come on back.\r\nDon’t forget about me here, OK?
1	That [VAR 0101(0000)] of yours...\nI don’t know why, but it sure takes me back!
2	You know Mankey, right?\nI’m actually the one who came up with it!\c\nThe boss told me to make a Pokémon with a bit\nof this and a bit of that, and that’s what I drew!\c\nI’m pretty fond of it myself!
3	You know, I thought up the Pokémon moves\nmyself and programmed ’em in myself, too.\c\nSo I never really wrote down the details or\nanything. Sorry about that...
4	We had a poll in the company once a long time\nago to see which Pokémon was most popular...\c\nand back then the winner was Exeggutor!
5	Tauros used to be real strong, huh?\c\nI was the one who thought up that one.\nBut Blizzard was a bit too strong, eh?
6	You know Diglett, right?\c\nIt’s actually basically just a character that I\nhad made up when I was a little kid.\r\nI even drew up a flip-book featuring it then!
7	You know Mew, right?\c\nI made it. Everything about it. The pixel art,\nits cry, its Pokédex entry, everything.\c\nI just barely finished in time, too! It was right at\nthe very end of the game’s development!
8	Can I tell you a little something, just between\nyou and me?\c\nSee, the Japanese version of Pokémon Blue was\nan exclusive release when it first came out.\r\nOnly certain people could get it.\c\nFrom what I heard, that was a real pain for the\npeople working in the shops that sold it...
9	We were all young folks in the office back when\nwe first made Pokémon Blue to be sold in Japan.\c\nNow we’re all a bunch of middle-aged coots.
10	Back in the day, the programming used up all\nthe space on a cartridge, so if we wanted to\r\nadd something new, we had to clean it up first...\c\nFirst we’d find enough space, then we could\nmake what we wanted... It was a pain!
11	In that one game, you could talk to the Pokémon\nfollowing you to find out how it was doing.\r\nI was the one who came up with that idea!
12	I heard something from Masuda one time...\c\nApparently the sound that plays when you save\nis different in each version...\c\nI gotta tell you...I can’t tell any difference at all!
13	Just between you and me, but...\c\nWhen we were working on these new titles once,\nI got told to come up with version differences...\r\nBoy, I was gobsmacked!\c\nBut in the end, I’m glad I helped make them.
14	You know Shuckle, right?\nI was the one who thought it up.\c\nBet you were surprised to find out that giving a\nShuckle a Berry to hold in Gold and Silver would\r\nturn it into a Berry Juice after battling!
15	You know Piloswine?\nI designed that Pokémon.\c\nI felt like I had to get all 12 animals in\nthe Chinese zodiac together, you know?
16	The Time Capsule was pretty awesome, right?\c\nBoy, it still sounds like a dream...\nTo be able to go back and forth in time, popping\r\nback to the past or into the future as you’d like!\c\nBut making it work was a real pain.
17	I loved the Bug-Catching Contest!\c\nDid you know that you can win it even by\ncatching a Caterpie or Metapod? It’s true!
18	Boy, when we were told halfway through\ndevelopment to make Kanto, too...\r\nI thought I might just expire on the spot!\c\nBut I’m glad we made it that way.
19	When we were having trouble fitting all the data\nin for Gold and Silver, and we were really in a\r\npinch, this amazing guy came along and made\r\na program for us that solved all our problems.\c\nHe went on to become the amazing president\nof a real big company soon after that, too.

26	I’d say I’m pretty up to speed on Pokémon\nbattling. And the director...\r\nWell, he’s not as good as me, but he’s not bad.\c\nSo what do you think?\nWant to take us both on in a Pokémon battle?
27	Let’s battle
28	Let’s not
29	But you don’t have two Pokémon that can fight!
30	Good.\nThen let’s do this!
31	Hey, Iwao!
32	Yup, I’m here! What did you...\nHuh?! A battle?!\r\nAll right! Then I’ll be aiming for victory!
33	Oh yeah? Well, that’s a real shame.\nI’m really good, after all.
34	You’re really good, too.\nI really thought we might whip you, but...\r\nWell, you sure got us in the end!
35	Very good! Really!\nYou’ve raised some great Pokémon!\r\nLet me heal them up for you.
36	We’ll fight you again sometime, if you want.\nJust once a day, though, OK?\c\nSo come back tomorrow.\nThough I’ll probably have forgotten you already.
37	We’re not gonna fight you again today.\nYou’ve got to come back tomorrow.
38	Oh, you’re a player!\nWe’ve been making games here.\r\nWhat color would you choose?
39	Red
40	Green
41	Blue
42	Yellow
43	Red, huh? Interesting!\nI’d say you’re probably the type who stays\r\ntrue to your heart and says what you want.
44	Green, huh? Interesting!\nI’d say you’re pretty dedicated to our game,\r\nthen. Are you a fanatic, maybe?
45	Blue, huh? Interesting!\nI’d say you’re probably the type who does what\r\nyou want, even if it’s not the popular thing.
46	Pi! Pikachu!\nPika pika chu!
47	And look at you!\nThat [VAR 0101(0000)] you’ve got with you...\r\nThat tells me you like to delve into history and\r\nthink about how things come to be.\c\nI’ve got a set of Poké Balls to give to a Trainer\nlike you!
48	You received a set of Poké Balls that have been\ncrafted from Apricorns!
49	Go on, and catch your favorite Pokémon in\nthe balls you like best!
50	Clefairy is the cutest, isn’t it?\nOooh, I just want to hug it and squeeze it!
51	Ciao!\c\nYou know, I just love getting to meet so many\nTrainers no matter where I go in the world!
52	Getting to have everyone play the game that\nI helped make... It’s a dream come true!
53	Everybody here at GAME FREAK loves sweets!\c\nIf you leave candy or anything sitting around,\nit will be gone in no time...\c\nHere, I’ll share a sweet drink with you, too.\nTake it from me!
54	[~ 54]
55	Have fun on your adventure with your Pokémon!
56	And here. I’ll give you this, too.\c\nWith one of these, the Pokémon you drop off at\nthe Pokémon Nursery will have a better chance\r\nthan usual of finding a Pokémon Egg.

0	Welcome to...\c\n... ...\c\nI’m sorry, but...\nare you [VAR 0100(0000)]?
1	I am
2	You know me?
3	I thought you must be.
4	From my son.
5	Guzma has actually come home a few times\nsince...all that.\c\nAnd he told me to give you this if you ever\ncame by.
6	It was always one of his favorite TMs.\c\nHe won so many trophies when he entered\nbattle competitions with the Pokémon that\r\nhe’d taught to use Swagger.
7	I know that there were a lot of rumors flying\naround, saying that our Guzma was up to no\r\ngood and doing terrible things...\c\nbut I know it was all just lies.
536
0	Eggcellent!\nSince you’re here, let me show you something!
1	Shiny Exeggcute!\nGolden, shining Exeggcute!\r\nAll six of them glitter so eggcellently!
2	I’d love to share one with you, but even though\nthey look like six Exeggcute, they are just one!\c\nBut if I can’t give you one of my shiny gold\nExeggcute, these should be close enough!
3	I’ve heard that Exeggcute in Alola evolve with\nsome kind of stone.\c\nBut I’m afraid that Nuggets don’t ever evolve\ninto Big Nuggets, no matter what you do...
537
0	...Ora?
1	It is holding something out to you...\nWill you take it?
2	Take it
3	Leave it
4	There you are!
5	...Mmm.
6	This fellow here’s my partner, Gru the Oranguru.\c\nBut he just hasn’t really taken a liking to me.\nMaybe he hasn’t known me long enough yet.\c\nHe often gets out on his own like this.\nI don’t know, maybe he feels stressed?
7	Mmph.
8	Did he maybe give you something?
9	Let me remind you that lying to an officer is an\noffense! I could have you up on charges!\c\nSo let me ask you one more time...
10	Ohhh, Gru...!\nThat was locked up in our safe!\c\nOranguru are clever Pokémon, so I’m sure Gru\nhere had no problem getting the safe open.
11	Mmm.
12	Sigh... Fine.\c\nYou take it then.\nUse it however you’d like.
13	Mmm.
14	I guess Gru must’ve gotten this nasty habit of\nlifting things from his old Trainer.\r\nSmart as a whip, but real sticky fingers.\c\nIt makes him a handful to control, but it’s not\nlike I can just ignore him till his old Trainer\r\ngets out of jail and comes back for him, right?\c\nSorry for complaining to you about my problems.\nHere, take this and be on your way.
15	And don’t feel like you’ve got to pay me back in\nkind for that Return.\c\nFavors don’t always need returning.\nThat’s not why I’m doing any of this.\c\nI just hope this fellow here can straighten out\nbefore his old Trainer gets back.
16	...Mmph.
538
0	I came all the way from this faraway region\ncalled Johto to visit Alola.\r\nIs it true you can’t use Fly to fly around here?
1	I don’t know. Is it?
2	Yes, it is
3	Seems like! I got told off for trying it!\nThey said it was some kind of law or something!\c\nBut then how do folks in Alola fly around?
4	Wow... So it’s really a thing?\nThis really is a whole different region.\c\nBut then how do folks in Alola fly around?
5	On Charizard
6	With a Ride Pager
7	Wow... So everyone just rides around on special\nCharizard that’ve been raised for the job?\c\nSounds weird, if you ask me, but I’ve gotta admit\nthat riding on a Charizard would be a blast!
8	Ho, so that’s how it works, huh?\nSpecial gear that can call Pokémon?\c\nI’d heard that Alola had a great transportation\nsystem, but it’s really true, huh?
9	Thanks for teaching me about how things are\nhere in Alola.\c\nHere, I’ll give you this lovely TM for your help!
10	Back where I’m from, in Johto, this kind of TM\nis a real big deal.\c\nThey’re called Hidden Machines, or HMs,\nbecause they’re so hard to get your hands on.\c\nBut here I guess it’s just another TM.\nMaybe you can use it in battle or something!
11	The way people live can be different depending\non where they live.\c\nThe value of things also depends on where you\nhappen to be.\c\nOne of the best things about traveling is getting\nto feel and understand that up close.

2	Oh, and there is something else!\nIf you leave two Pokémon together at the\r\nnursery, you sometimes end up finding an Egg!\c\nSince we’re talking about it, do you want one of\nthe Eggs I found here at the nursery recently?
3	Thanks for taking it off my hands!\c\nAnd don’t go trying to crack it just because you\ncan’t wait to see what’s inside!\c\nThough I’ve never heard of a Pokémon Egg\ncracking except when it’s ready to hatch.
4	Oh, yeah? Well, I’ll hold on to it for now, but if\nyou change your mind, this Egg can be yours!
5	Do you want one of the Eggs I found here at the\nnursery recently?
6	If you carry a Pokémon Egg around with you,\nit will hatch into a Pokémon.\c\nI bet it must feel pretty happy being surrounded\nby your team, even before it’s born.
7	Whoa! You can’t even take an Egg?!\nHow many Pokémon have you caught?!\c\nI guess I’ll hold on to it for now, but it’s yours\nif you ever want it.

8	... ... ...
9	Why you...
10	Anyway, I do appreciate you taking the time\nto stop by anyway, so I hope you’ll take these.
11	Those two are real valuable power boosters!

13	... ... ...
14	Come on! Throw me a bone here, Pelly!\nI thought you were my partner!

6	I reckon I ought to give you a little gift to help\nyou celebrate becoming Champion, then.
7	Give that there to a Rhydon to hold, and then\ntrade it with a friend. You’ll see what happens.\c\nCourse there are no Rhydon native to Alola, but\nif you ever find one, give it a try for me, eh?
8	That boy of mine was pretty happy to hear that\nyou’d become Champion like that.\c\nI hope you’ll stay friends with him. He may not\nlook it, but he’s always been a lonely child.

2	It looks like you have what it takes.\nThen tell me, my good Trainer...\c\nWhich item would you have a Pokémon hold\nif you want Rain Dance to last a long time?
3	That’s it! Correct!\c\nIf a Pokémon holding a Damp Rock uses Rain\nDance, the rain will keep falling for eight turns!\c\nBut I’m not beaten yet!\nNext question!
4	Oooh, that’s a shame...\nThe correct answer was the Damp Rock.\c\nIf a Pokémon holding a Damp Rock uses Rain\nDance, the rain will keep falling for eight turns.\c\nBut I suppose everyone makes mistakes...\nLet’s move on to the next question!
5	Which item would you have a Pokémon hold\nif you want Hail to last a long time?
6	That’s it! Correct!\c\nIf a Pokémon holding an Icy Rock uses Hail,\nthe hail will keep falling for eight whole turns!\c\nBut I’ve still got some HP in me!\nNext question!
7	Oooh, that’s a shame...\nThe correct answer was the Icy Rock.\c\nIf a Pokémon holding an Icy Rock uses Hail,\nthe hail will keep on falling for eight turns.\c\nBut I suppose everyone makes mistakes...\nLet’s move on to the next question!
8	Which item would you have a Pokémon hold\nif you want sunshine that goes on for ages?
9	That’s it! Correct!\c\nIf a Pokémon holding a Heat Rock uses Sunny\nDay, the sun will shine forth for eight turns!\c\nBut I’m still in this match!\nNext question!
10	Oooh, that’s a shame...\nThe correct answer was the Heat Rock.\c\nIf a Pokémon holding a Heat Rock uses Sunny\nDay, the sun will shine forth for eight turns.\c\nBut I suppose everyone makes mistakes...\nLet’s move on to the next question!
11	Which item would you have a Pokémon hold\nif you want a sandstorm to last a long time?
12	That’s it! Correct!\c\nIf a Pokémon holding a Smooth Rock uses\nSandstorm, the storm will rage for eight turns!
13	Oooh, that’s a shame...\nThe correct answer was the Smooth Rock.\c\nIf a Pokémon holding a Smooth Rock uses\nSandstorm, the storm will rage for eight turns!
14	The most important part of any education is\nputting it to work in the real world.\c\nIt’s not enough to understand it in your head.\nYou’ve got to know it in your bones!\c\nThat’s why I’ll give you this set of rocks I’ve\ncollected for your own use.
15	There are lots of ways to use the weather to\nyour advantage in battles, so give it a try.\c\nLike you could use rain to power up your\nWater-type moves or to weaken the Fire-type\r\nmoves someone might use against you.\c\nOr you could call a sandstorm to deal damage\nevery turn to any Pokémon that isn’t a Rock,\r\nGround, or Steel type.

0	Welcome to the Thrifty Megamart!\nThanks for choosing the Thrifty Megamart!
1	...Hold on a second there, pal.\c\nYou look to me like a kid...\c\nbuuut I can tell just by looking at you that you’re\na pretty decent Trainer.\c\nSure, I’m just a part-time worker now, pounding\naway at the register with a smile on my face,\r\nbut once I was a Trainer, traveling around on\r\nmy island challenge, too.
2	I even made a pretty fair name for myself.\nKagetora the Eevee User, that was me.\c\nBut then I got a wife, and then I had a kid...\nNow I face a new trial called a mortgage.\c\nAnd I work here to prepare me for the most\ngrand trial of all: old age and retirement!
3	...But never mind all that.\c\nLook, there’s something I’d like to ask an able\nyoung Trainer like you to do for me.\c\nBack in my heyday, there were these eight older\nTrainers I was always trying to beat.\c\nThey all used Pokémon that evolve from Eevee.\c\nHow would you feel about taking them on?\c\nIf you say that Kagetora sent you, I’m sure\nthey’ll agree to a battle.
4	If you can beat them all for me, I’ll have\nsomething to give you. It’ll be worth it.\c\nSo just ask me if you want to know more about\nany of ’em.
5	Oh, it’s you again.\c\nSo how’s that favor coming along?\nNeed me to tell you about an opponent?

12	The Leafeon User
13	The Sylveon User
14	No, I’m good
15	The Vaporeon User, Polly...\nThey called her the Wild Whirlpool of Alola.\c\nShe was a cool drink of water, all right.\nA bikini-clad beauty who beat all the boys.\c\nHer Vaporeon’s Hydro Pump could blast through\nsolid steel plating...\c\nShe was from Melemele originally, and I think\nshe trained to be a teacher...\c\nIt’s been 30 years since I last saw her, but I\nhope that’ll be enough to find her.
16	The fiery magician, brimming with life...\nChad the Flareon User.\c\nHis temper burned as hot as any flame, and he\nwas always quick to find a fight.\c\nHis Flareon’s fire attacks were relentless, going\nafter opponents like a living thing.\c\nI know he always stayed at the Tide Song Hotel\nback in those days...\c\nIt’s been 30 years since I last saw him, but I\nhope that’ll be enough to find him.
17	Oh yes. The electrifying ball of energy that was\nJane the Jolteon User...\c\nShe looked like a lovely young Lass, but beneath\nthat sweet face was the heart of a tyrant...\c\nHer Jolteon slammed into opponents like a bolt\nof lightning from a blue sky...\c\nLast I heard, she was working somewhere\non Ula’ula Island...\c\nIt’s been 30 years since I last saw her, but I\nhope that’ll be enough to find her.
18	The Espeon User, Ishaan...\nThe sun itself was charmed by his sweet looks.\c\nHis Espeon danced past enemy attacks, letting\nthem slide right off it like some kinda miracle.\c\nIshaan worked at the Geothermal Power Plant\nback in those days, but now...\c\nIt’s been 30 years since I last saw him, but I\nhope that’ll be enough to find him.
19	The immortal ruler of the night...\nBraiden the Umbreon User.\c\nThe rumors say that he died once and came\nback to life. Everyone was afraid of him.\c\nHis Umbreon gave off its horrifying aura all the\ntime and never let up...\c\nHe used to hold some kind of ceremony in the\ncemetery on Melemele Island every night...\c\nIt’s been 30 years since I last saw him, but I\nhope that’ll be enough to find him.
20	Miss Absolute Zero...\nRea the Glaceon User.\c\nThat cool beauty seemed to have a soul of ice\nwhen she mercilessly pursued her opponents.\c\nEven time froze around her Glaceon!\c\nI know that she originally came from some small\nvillage on Melemele Island...\c\nIt’s been 30 years since I last saw her, but I\nhope that’ll be enough to find her.
21	A goddess of beauty in full bloom...\nLinnea the Leafeon User.\c\nShe was a world-famous model and a powerful\nGrass-type Pokémon user.\c\nWhen her Leafeon cried out, even withered and\ndead trees burst into bloom once more...\c\nShe used to always stay at the Hano Grand\nResort when she was between gigs...\c\nIt’s been 30 years since I last saw her, but I\nhope that’ll be enough to find her.
22	The queen of Fairy Pokémon...\nYes, Sakura the Sylveon User.\c\nThat pure young maiden was adored by Fairy-\ntype Pokémon, who saw her as a queen.\c\nEven wild beasts were captivated when her\nSylveon appeared before them...\c\nI heard that she was a descendant of the\nnomadic seafolk...\c\nThat’s the best hint I can give you to find her.
23	Got it.\nRemember, I’m counting on you, kid.
24	Oh, it’s you.\c\nWait, what?! You beat them all?!\nWhat happened then?!
25	... ...\n... ...\c\nTime truly is cruel to us all, isn’t it?\c\nFine then. I’m ready now.
26	I have one last favor to ask of you.\nWould you let me have a battle?
27	Of course
28	Hold on
29	If I do this, I think I’ll be ready...to let go.
30	I understand... I’ll wait.
31	Enough. It’s enough.\nOur day has come...and it has gone.\c\nBut I haven’t forgotten your reward.\nHere. I want you to take this.
32	I used that crystal back when I was a young\nTrainer, but I don’t need it now.\c\nYou use it and you build a new age.\c\nI’ll stay here and take care of the mortgage and\nthe old age.
33	You’re not one of the students, are you?\nWhat do you want from an old cleaning lady?
34	Are you the Vaporeon User?
35	It’s nothing...
36	...Well, yes, I suppose I am.\c\nWhat’s that? Kagetora sent you to battle me?\c\nI don’t mind. But no complaints out of you for\nhaving to take on this bent old woman!
37	Every rain cloud has its end...\nAnd no one can win against time’s march.\c\nNow I’m retired from training, and I spend my\ndays with Vaporeon cleaning these windows.\c\nBut how is that boy Kagetora doing?\nIs he well?
38	...Yes? What is it?\nDo you need something from me?
39	Are you the Flareon User?
40	It’s nothing...
41	Oh...\nAh...\c\nI see...\nSo you know Kagetora?\c\nYou would like a Pokémon battle from me?\nHow...nostalgic. It’s been quite some time.
42	A fire needs fuel to keep on burning.\nBut once the fuel is burnt up, only ash remains.\c\nMy working life is over. I’ve reached retirement.\nAll that is left of my life is the ashes.\c\nMe and Flareon are done with battling.\nI’d rather just go to lomi lomi and relax.
43	Ya-a-awn...\nThe old eyes are getting tired...
44	Are you the Jolteon User?
45	It’s nothing...
46	...Why, yes, I suppose I am. I’m Jane.\c\nEevee? Kagetora?\nI’m sorry, child. I don’t remember them...\c\nI do remember Pokémon battles, though...\nThough I’m not sure if I’m still up to one...
47	When lightning strikes the earth, it is swallowed\nup...and it disappears.\c\nEven if you try to whip an old body into action,\nthere are simply limits to what it can do.\c\nAnd besides...I really don’t remember anyone\ncalled Kagetora.
48	I suppose I should be moving...\nI’ll need to fix Espeon some supper...
49	Are you the Espeon User?
50	It’s nothing...
51	Why, that’s a question I haven’t heard in many\nlong years. I am Ishaan, if that’s what you mean.\c\nKagetora?\c\nOh! Oh yes! I remember that boy!\nNow that is a tale that takes me back...\c\nAnd you want to have a battle with me?\c\nI suppose I could, but please keep in mind\nthat I am an old man.
52	Even the sun itself, who rises with such glory\nin the morning, must eventually set.\c\nSo it is for human life, and I think...\nI think that I see the moon rising on the horizon.\c\nBut what about that Kagetora?\nHe’s not that much younger than me...\c\nDo tell him I said hello.
53	I suppose that’s enough for today...\c\nI’d better hurry home or that son of mine will\ngo berating me again for wandering off...
54	Are you the Umbreon User?
55	It’s nothing...
56	...That tale is decades old by now.\nHow old are you, [VAR 1100(00FF,0403)]boygirl?\c\nWell, you’re not wrong.\nI was once known as Braiden the Umbreon User.\c\nAnd you know young Kagetora?\nHow is that little whippersnapper?\c\nSure, I don’t mind battling with you...\nThough I’m due to check in to the hospital soon.
57	No night can ever be endless.\nDawn comes and snatches away the dark.\c\nI feel that light creeping into my life, blotting\nout the stars and stealing away the night.\c\nPeople used to talk about me once.\nSaid I was immortal and such nonsense.\r\nI was just in the hospital a long while, that’s all.\r\nBut human life does end.\r\nAnyway...you give Kagetora my regards.
58	It’s about time for my appointment with\nthe beautician...
59	Are you the Leafeon User?
60	It’s nothing...
61	W-well...yes, I suppose I am.\nWho might you be, child?\c\nOh! A friend of sweet little Kagetora’s?\c\nOf course I’d be delighted to battle you!\nI still have some spirit left in me!
62	The flower that blooms will wilt and fall.\nThe stalk will wither and return to the earth.\c\nBut not for Leafeon and me!\nWe refuse to accept such a reality.\c\nI will do everything that money and medicine\ncan do to keep my looks!\c\nBut my bones can’t help telling the truth.\nAt any rate, do say hello to Kagetora for me.
63	When is that grandson of mine coming home?
64	Are you the Glaceon User?
65	It’s nothing...
66	Well... I am Rea, who used to always use\na Glaceon in battle.\c\nYou’re friends with that Kagetora?\c\nSure, I’ll battle you.\nI’ll get it over with in no time, don’t you worry.
67	Even the drifting snow will melt away.\c\nThe only thing I want out of life now is to spend\nas much time as I can with my grandchildren.\c\nYou tell Kagetora that’s my biggest worry now.\nI don’t want him sending more Trainers after me.
68	Then I’ve got to go and get Sylveon some snacks\nat the malasada shop...and...
69	Are you the Sylveon User?
70	It’s nothing...
71	...You’re looking for the Sylveon User Sakura?\nThat’s my grandma!\c\nAnd that Kagetora guy asked you to come\nvisit her?\c\nBut my grandma died last year, you know?\c\nOh, I know!\c\nHere, I keep Sylveon now, so how about I battle\nyou instead!
72	The sweetest part of life is when you’re cute.\nBut the sweetest part is also the shortest.\c\nThat’s what my grandma told me.\c\nMaybe you can tell that to your Mr. Kagetora\nor whomever!
73	Welcome to the Thrifty Megamart!\nThanks for choosing the Thrifty Megamart!\c\nHmm. You look like a Trainer, but I can tell that\nyou’re still just getting started.\c\nIf you can become the strongest Trainer in all\nAlola, why don’t you come talk to me again?
549
0	Lomi lomi is the style of massage we practice\nhere in Alola.\r\nHow about a treatment for your Pokémon?\r\nIt will make them feel more friendly toward you.\c\nWhat do you say? Can I do a little lomi lomi on\nthat [VAR 0101(0000)] you have there?
1	If you ever want to experience the joys of\nlomi lomi massage, just stop by our shop here.
2	Then allow me to just take [VAR 0101(0000)]\nthere for a moment...
3	[~ 3]
4	There we go!\c\nIt was a really productive session of lomi lomi.\nI think you’ll notice a lot of friendly feelings!
5	There we go!\c\nI think that lomi lomi session helped inspire\nsome good, friendly feelings toward you.
6	There we go!\c\nI think this session was a good start. It’s feeling\na bit more friendly toward you already, I’d say.
7	I can only manage one session of lomi lomi per\nday, but do feel free to come again tomorrow!
8	Do you want to know if your Pokémon feel\nfriendly toward you or not?
9	I understand. Sometimes knowing can be\nworse than not knowing.
10	Then I’ll have a look at your [VAR 0101(0001)]\nthere, shall I?
11	My! It feels incredibly close to you!\nNothing makes it happier than being with you!
12	You clearly love your [VAR 0101(0000)], and you\nmust spend a lot of time together.
13	Hm. I’d say that you and [VAR 0101(0000)] have\nthe potential to be an even greater combo.
14	Hmmm. I think...it feels friendly toward you.\nAt least a little...
15	Hmmm... I’d say that you and your Pokémon\nstill have a long way to go.
16	What is going on here? Do you let it get knocked\nout a lot in battles or something? This is bad.
17	Oh dear. You must be a merciless Trainer...\nDo you use Frustration or just not know better?
18	Oh tapu! How could you leave it like this?!\nTake it to a Pokémon Center right now!
19	You’re curious about an Egg?\nYou must want to meet whatever is inside soon!
550
0	This place here is a haven where children and\nPokémon can rest and be at peace.\c\nBut I’m in the middle of cleaning right now, so\nI’ll have to ask you to leave.
1	I know you. Thanks to your efforts, both the\npresident and the foundation were saved.\r\nThat’s what I’ve heard.
2	I would like to entrust you with a very precious\nPokémon, as a show of gratitude from myself.\c\nWill you take this Porygon from me?
3	It looks like your Boxes are full, though.\nPlease make some space and come back again.
4	Porygon is a miracle born of science.\nA Pokémon with a digital brain.
5	Science exists to lead us to a brighter future.\c\nAnd I am here to protect those who will inherit\nthat future.
6	The Aether Foundation funds this facility.\c\nPeople and Pokémon can all live here, as equals\nand as family.
7	You’re [VAR 0100(0000)], aren’t you?\nI heard about you from Ms. Wicke.\c\nAs a member of the foundation, I’m grateful to\nyou...so please take this.
8	I believe that the foundation will change after...\nwell...all that ruckus that happened.\c\nWe will reflect on our errors and remake the\nfoundation as something even more than it was.\c\nWe will work hard to update and improve.
9	I can admit that I did wonder for a time about\nwhether I should quit the foundation.\c\nBut I want to keep protecting the smiles of the\nchildren and the Pokémon here.

1	[VAR 0109(0000)] [VAR BD03(0000)]$[VAR 0202(0001)]
2	Nothing
3	That’s right.\nYou don’t need anything more to carry now.
4	But you can’t carry any more!
5	But you don’t have enough money!
6	[VAR 1303(0000)][VAR 0109(0000)] came out!
7	Do you want to get one more?
8	What luck!\nAnother [VAR 0109(0000)] tumbled down!
9	It’s a vending machine!\nAnd all of your favorite drinks to buy are...\r\ncompletely sold out!
552
0	Bwo! Bwo!\nBwooorrrrrr!
1	I wouldn’t tease that one.\nIf you do, he’ll buck and kick you.
2	Tauros are generally known as spirited Pokémon,\nbut this fellow is pretty feisty even for a Tauros.\c\nBut I guess it’s not that surprising, considering\nhow new he is to the ranch.
3	I’d like him to train to become a Ride Pokémon.\c\nBut I can’t even put him through his paces if\nhe bucks at every little thing like this.
4	I guess we’ll need the mistress’s skill for\nthis one!
5	The mistress?
6	Is that you?
7	The mistress of Paniola Ranch, of course!\nShe can get even the most unruly Tauros\r\nsnapped right into line!
8	Me? Ridiculous!\nHahahahah!\c\nYou think the mistress is some weak little girl?
9	Right then.\nIt’s time we call the mistress!
10	Here she is...the mistress of the ranch!\nMiltank!
11	Moooo moooo!
12	One roar from Miltank and even the most ornery\nTauros is instantly as quiet as a little Litten!
13	Mil moooooo!
14	Mooo!\nMo-mo mo moooooo!
15	Mroooowwwrrrr!
16	Mooooooooo!
17	Hff! Mooo!\nMooorrrrrrrrr!
18	Well, they do say the stronger the Tauros is,\nthe harder it is to control.\c\nLooks like even the mistress is having a tough\ntime with this one.
19	Maybe if he burns off a bit of excess energy,\nit’ll be a bit easier to bring him to heel...\c\nWhat do you think?\nHow about taking on Tauros in a battle?
20	Sure, I’ll battle
21	Maybe later...
22	Then don’t hold back!\nGo all out against this one!
23	Really? I thought it’d be a great help to us if\nyou could do it...
24	Looks like you worked up a fine sweat!\nI think Tauros feels pretty satisfied, too.
25	Bwoooooor!
26	Moooooo!\nMo-mo mooo!
27	Mo... Hff...
28	Even Tauros couldn’t stand up to the combined\npowers of the pair of you and Miltank!
29	Thanks, sweetie!\nJust what we expect of the ranch’s mistress!
30	Mil-mooooooooo!
31	Thanks to you, I think we can finally start on\nthis fellow’s Ride Pokémon training.\c\nSo I hope you’ll take this Scope Lens from me!\nGive it to a Pokémon to hold, and its moves\r\nwill be more likely to land as critical hits!
32	With Ride Pokémon, even people who aren’t\nPokémon Trainers can enjoy a convenient life.
33	Bwooorrr!
34	None of our Tauros dare slack off as long as the\nmistress is watching! Hah!
35	Mil-moooooo!
553
0	So...so...
1	Cooor!
2	This Pokémon seems to be hurt...\nWhat will you do?
3	Use a Potion on it
4	Take it to a Pokémon Center
5	Sorry, sorry, sorry!\nI know! I took way too long!\c\n...Huh?
6	I just left my Pokémon here to play for a little bit\nwhile I was shopping in town.\c\nI checked that there weren’t any Pokémon here\nthat would bully my Corsola but...\c\nBut there was a Mareanie hiding in the rocks!\nOooh! I want to fish it up and show it my wrath!
7	Mareanie love breaking off and eating Corsola’s\nbranches more than anything else in the world!\c\nThey hunt Corsola down mercilessly to gnaw\nand nibble on their branches!\c\nSure, the Corsola’s branches can regenerate\nand they’ll eventually grow back, but...\r\nThat doesn’t make it any less scary for Corsola!
8	You were worried about my Corsola and trying\nto help them, weren’t you?\c\nThank you. You’re a really nice Trainer.\c\nHere, take this from me. If your Pokémon is hit\nwith a Water-type move while holding this,\r\nits Sp. Def will get a boost!
9	Come on, let’s get you both all better.\nOff to the Pokémon Center!

3	Oh, my dad owns the Hano Grand Resort, so...\c\nAnyway. You’re the Champion now, right?\nSo are you out there training every day?[VAR 0114(0019)]
4	Of course!
5	Uhhh...what?
6	Just what I would expect of a Champion!\nThat is very wise thinking.\c\nI’m a top-ranking player in the golf world, and\nthat is because I still practice every day.[VAR 0114(0019)]
7	You’re the Champion, aren’t you?\c\nI’m a top-ranking player in the golf world, and\nthat is because I still practice every day![VAR 0114(0019)]
8	I think it’s important to keep training every day,\neven if it’s for just a bit.\c\nI’ll give you this. It should help you aim for\neven loftier goals![VAR 0114(0019)]
9	Many Flying-type Pokémon are fast, right?\c\nThat’s why I use Trick Room to up my handicap.\c\nIt forces me to train in battles where the slower\nPokémon get to move first.[VAR 0114(0019)]
10	I should get going, though.\c\nI’ve got to get back to my daily training regimen.\nTen more hours to go today.[VAR 0114(0019)]

15	Maybe not
16	Order up!\nLocal Z-set for one!
17	Hi, can I get a table?[VAR 0114(0009)]
18	Of course! Come in, come in.\nWe’re always happy to see you, Miss Olivia!

9	A Persim Berry heals confusion!\nA Pecha Berry heals poison status!\c\nAnd a Sitrus Berry restores more HP than an\nOran Berry!
10	Alola is great!\c\nYou can get plenty of Berries without planting\nBerries in a Berry field!\c\nBut some Pokémon gather around trees trying to\nget Berries as well!
11	Mufufu! If you get a Persim Berry,\nplease show it to me.
12	If you’re ever looking for more Berries,\nyou won’t have to look Berry hard!\c\nWa ha ha ha!\c\nBerries grow like...well, like weeds here in Alola,\nso feel free to pick up any you find!

9	UB-04. Code name: “Blade.”\nYes, I can tell you about it!\c\nIt seems to be a horrifying beast that can cut\nthrough absolutely anything!\c\nSightings were made in two locations.\c\nRoute 17 and Malie Garden!\c\nIt seems highly likely that the creatures are on\nthe move around Ula’ula Island.\c\nThe sightings indicate four specimens.\c\nSo the goal of this mission will be to find and\nprotect four individuals, if you can![VAR 0114(001F)]

12	Oh ho, how funny you are, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nWe’ve caught all the UBs already, haven’t we?\c\nI’m certain that black refractor that I thought\nI saw on Melemele was just my imagination![VAR 0114(001F)]
13	Beast Balls are incredibly valuable Poké Balls!\c\nI asked Madam Wicke, who works in the secret\nlabs, and she said a single ball costs millions!\c\nIt appears you still have some on you, as well.\nBe very careful about using them![VAR 0114(001F)]
14	What?! You mean you ran out of Beast Balls?!\c\nWell...then I suppose I must give you one of the\nextras that I have been holding in reserve![VAR 0114(001F)]

19	Ah yes, the matter of the UBs.\c\nDisclosing info on this is prohibited, so let’s\nplease keep this between you and me.\c\nFirst, please take these.[VAR 0114(0016)]
20	The International Police asked me to pass them\nto you.[VAR 0114(0016)]
21	What are they?
22	Poké Balls?
23	Those are Beast Balls, which the Aether\nFoundation developed in great secrecy...\c\nThey are a special kind of Poké Ball that are\nspecialized for capturing Ultra Beasts.\c\nAs a result, they are very expensive to make, so\nwe have not been able to mass-produce them.\c\nPlease consider your timing very carefully for\nwhen you will use them during a battle.[VAR 0114(0016)]
24	The appearance of the UBs is something that\nwe at the foundation are to blame for...\c\nThat is why I will do whatever is within my\npower to assist you in this.\c\nFor now, perhaps you should return to Ms.\nAnabel at the motel in Akala.\c\nShe may have discovered new info.[VAR 0114(0016)]

27	What’s special about the UBs?
28	Show me the UB data
29	Nihilego
30	Buzzwole
31	Pheromosa
32	Xurkitree
33	Kartana
34	Celesteela
35	Guzzlord
36	Never mind
37	Ultra Beasts are life-forms from another world.\c\nIf you try to throw a regular Poké Ball at one,\nthe ball will have a difficult time recognizing the\r\ncreature as a Pokémon, and so the capturing\r\nfunction will be significantly impaired.\c\nBut these special balls should allow you to\ncapture beasts quite normally.\c\nThey could be considered the foundation’s\nnegative assets, but I hope they will help you.[VAR 0114(0016)]
38	The UBs surround themselves with an aura\ncalled the Beast Boost.\c\nThe truth of this aura is that it is the energy\nthat flows within the Ultra Wormhole.\c\nWhen the UBs pass through the Ultra Wormhole,\nthey are bathed in a great deal of this energy\r\nand likely store it within their bodies.[VAR 0114(0016)]
39	There are also Pokémon on our planet that\npossess this same kind of energy.\c\nI think you know what I mean.\c\nThe so-called Totem Pokémon that you faced in\nyour trials.\c\nThis is because the energy pours down upon\nour planet when the holes open.[VAR 0114(0016)]
40	Which Ultra Beast would you like to learn\nmore about?[VAR 0114(0016)]
41	UB-01. Code name: “Symbiont.”\nProperly known as Nihilego.\c\nThere have been sightings reported of this\nbeast in Alola’s past.\c\nIts most distinctive feature is its parasitic\ncapability.\c\nWhen Nihilego latches on to a host, it does not\nmanipulate its actions directly.\c\nRather it awakens the host’s own capabilities\nand boosts them to an extreme extent in order\r\nto protect itself.
42	It injects the host with a sort of neurotoxin to\nachieve this effect.\c\nThis neurotoxin of Nihilego’s is incredibly\nstimulating and inspires feelings of extreme\r\nexcitement and a lack of inhibition in its host.\c\nIn other words, anything or anyone that a\nNihilego latches on to will have its native skills\r\nforcibly activated to their fullest extent and will\r\nthen act as it naturally desires to.
43	UB-02. Code name: “Absorption.”\nProperly known as Buzzwole.\c\nThis UB was sighted for the first time following\nthe incidents at Aether Foundation.\c\nIts most distinctive feature is its skill to\nstrengthen itself.\c\nBuzzwole is able to absorb energy and then\nachieve a chemical reaction between the energy\r\nit has absorbed and its own body fluids.
44	As a result, Buzzwole’s body swells to an\nalmost explosive extent.\c\nIts muscles bulge and are so thick and dense\nthat they are stronger even than steel.\c\nBoth its Attack and Defense experience a clear\nleap in power.\c\nIt also displays a habit of striking a pose each\ntime that it takes any sort of action...\c\nIt is thought this might serve as a method of\ncommunication, but it is not well understood.
45	UB-02. Code name: “Beauty.”\nProperly known as Pheromosa.\c\nThis UB was sighted for the first time following\nthe incidents at Aether Foundation.\c\nThis UB can reach speeds exceeding 120 mph\nin just an instant.\c\nThis speed is greater than any other living\ncreature that has been discovered to date.\c\nBut its most distinctive features may in fact be\nits beauty and its powerful pheromones.
46	Most any creature that squares off against a\nPheromosa becomes confused, as if struck by\r\nthe beast’s beauty, and loses the will to fight.\c\nIt is still a subject of research, but it’s thought\nthat Pheromosa may possess some sort of\r\norgan able to produce a pheromonal substance\r\npreviously unknown to science.
47	UB-03. Code name: “Lighting.”\nProperly known as Xurkitree.\c\nThis UB was sighted for the first time following\nthe incidents at Aether Foundation.\c\nIts most distinctive feature is an organ that\ncan generate power.\c\nThis UB’s bodily makeup is highly reminiscent\nof electric wiring, thus enabling it to conduct\r\nelectricity with great efficiency.
48	It can discharge as much as a million volts of\npower at a time.\c\nWhen it begins to run out of power, it stabs its\nlegs and tail into the soil, entering a treelike\r\nstate as it absorbs electricity from the ground.
49	UB-04. Code name: “Blade.”\nProperly known as Kartana.\c\nThis UB was sighted for the first time following\nthe incidents at Aether Foundation.\c\nIts most distinctive feature is its thin and razor-\nsharp body, of which every edge has as cruel\r\na cutting edge as any well-honed blade.\c\nThe edges on its arms are particularly in a class\nof their own.
50	Any opponent who tries to attack it will be\ncut down with a single strike of its “blades.”\c\nIts thin body also allows it to evade attacks by\ndancing lightly out of the way.\c\nThis is a very dangerous creature, considering\nits excellent offensive and defensive\r\ncapabilities, but due to the nature of its body, it\r\nis also highly vulnerable to fire and moisture.
51	UB-04. Code name: “Blaster.”\nProperly known as Celesteela.\c\nThis UB was sighted for the first time following\nthe incidents at Aether Foundation.\c\nIts most distinctive feature is the energy that\nit stores within itself, a flammable gas that it\r\ncan shoot from its two huge arms.
52	This is mostly used to propel itself in flight and\nfor battle, but it is thought to have sufficient\r\npower and lift to even fly into space.\c\nIts bodily construction closely resembles that of\na plant, and it absorbs nutrients from the soil.
53	UB-05. Code name: “Glutton.”\nProperly known as Guzzlord.\c\nThis UB has been sighted in the Alola region\nin the past as well, according to our reports.\c\nIt seems it was targeted by the International\nPolice in a top-secret mission at that time.\c\nIts most distinctive feature is its limitless\nappetite. It feeds without pause every moment\r\nthat it is awake.
54	It uses the two large tongues that protrude from\nits mouth to catch and devour everything in its\r\npath, be it organic or inorganic matter.\c\nAnd while it eats such an inordinate amount,\nGuzzlord excreta has never been discovered.\c\nIt is thought that it might fully convert the\nthings that it eats into energy for it to use.
55	Please...do be careful.[VAR 0114(0016)]
56	Hm? What is this Pokédex data,\n[VAR 0100(0000)]?\c\n...Necrozma.\c\nIt’s black, yet it’s refracting light...\c\nBut we haven’t had any word from HQ about\nsuch a UB.\c\nIt must be simply a rare Pokémon.\nStill, it’s quite remarkable, though![VAR 0114(001F)]

0	My widdle Mimi...\nShe won’t let me change her clothes.\r\nMaybe she really likes the ones she has on?
1	Mimik.
2	But I don’t wanna throw this one away...\nDo you want it, mister? You can have it.
3	But I don’t wanna throw this one away...\nDo you want it, miss? You can have it.
4	Do you think Mimi cleans her clothes?\c\nI’ve never seen her change them...
561
0	Hey. You.[VAR 0114(0030)]
1	You are the one they call [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0030)]
2	I am
3	Not me
4	Hm...[VAR 0114(0030)]
5	I can see right through any lies you tell, [VAR 1100(00FF,0403)]boygirl.[VAR 0114(0030)]
6	A certain...interested party sent me here\nto you...to give you this.[VAR 0114(0030)]
7	You should have a look at what it says.[VAR 0114(0030)]
8	But take care where you read it.\nNo one else is to know of my visit or that card.[VAR 0114(0030)]
9	So you actually came...[VAR 0114(0030)]
10	You must be [VAR 0100(0000)]. Mustn’t you?[VAR 0114(0030)]
11	Please, you’ll have to forgive me for my stunning\ndisguise earlier.[VAR 0114(0030)]
12	I’m very grateful that you accepted my invitation\nto join me here in my room.\c\nMy name...it is Looker.\nI am a member of the International Police.[VAR 0114(0030)]
13	And this figure here is my boss...[VAR 0114(001F)]
14	It is an honor to meet you, of course,\nthe first Champion of Alola.\c\nPlease forgive our rude summons.\c\nMy name is Anabel.\c\nI am the head of a secret division within the\nInternational Police. We are the UB Task Force.[VAR 0114(0030)]
15	Please forgive me for the most sudden question,\nbut I must ask...\c\nis it true that you encountered UB Symbiont?[VAR 0114(001F)]
16	UB?
17	Symbiont?
18	The UBs are the beasts...\notherwise known as Ultra Beasts.\c\nThey are unidentified life-forms that reside in\na different world from the one we live in.\c\nThat Nihilego creature you encountered was\none such beast.[VAR 0114(0029)]
19	Yes, UB-01...Symbiont.\nI suppose you knew it as Nihilego.\c\nThe International Police refers to all of the\nUBs by code names, like Symbiont there.\c\nI believe you might recognize it as the Pokémon\nthat the woman Lusamine fused with?[VAR 0114(0029)]
20	Now that we have cleared that up, please allow\nme to ask once more.\c\nDid you come in contact with Symbiont?\nThat is, with Nihilego?[VAR 0114(001F)]
21	I did
22	I beat it
23	Just as we had thought...[VAR 0114(0029)]
24	That seems to settle things, Chief.[VAR 0114(001F)]
25	Listen. Everything that we are about to share\nwith you is highly classified information.\c\nWe must ask that you keep all that you learn\nhere to yourself.\c\nThe incident that Ms. Lusamine caused...\nSymbiont wasn’t the only UB to appear from\r\nthe Ultra Wormhole that was temporarily\r\nopened at that time.[VAR 0114(0029)]
26	We have confirmed the presence of another\nSymbiont, other than the one you encountered.\r\nAnd we have received reports of sightings of\r\nseveral other types of UBs...\c\nThe UBs are dangerous beings whose powers\nexceed the boundaries and logic of our world.\c\nAnd they were dropped rudely into this world\nagainst their own will...\c\nWe can only expect that they will be extremely\nwary and combative.[VAR 0114(001F)]
27	And so we have been tasked with three duties.\c\nThe first is to investigate the ecology of these\nunidentified UBs.\c\nThe second is to look out for UBs and protect\nthe people from any harm.\c\nAnd the third is to either protect the UBs...\nor destroy them...[VAR 0114(0029)]
28	If the UBs are destructive beings that will seek\nsome sort of revenge upon our world, then the\r\norder from above is to erase them completely.[VAR 0114(001F)]
29	But neither myself nor Looker would like to see\nthat happen.\c\nEven if they are UBs, they are living creatures.\nWe would like to protect them and save them.[VAR 0114(0029)]
30	But protecting the UBs...\c\nit would seem to amount to catching them,\nand that is a more difficult task than simply\r\ndestroying them would be.\c\nWe do not currently have the battle power\nnecessary to achieve such a goal.[VAR 0114(001F)]
31	And so we finally arrive at the point.\nLet us dispense with any pretense...\c\nWe wish for you, the Champion of Alola, to\nlend us your assistance.[VAR 0114(0029)]
32	[VAR 0100(0000)]...\nwe want you to join our team.\c\nPlease give your aid to the UB Task Force.[VAR 0114(0029)]
33	Sure!
34	What?!
35	Please...\nWe want to save the UBs.\c\nBut to do that, we will need your strength...[VAR 0114(0029)]
36	You accept?\nThank you very much![VAR 0114(0029)]
37	So that means, Chief...[VAR 0114(001F)]
38	I know, Mr. Looker.[VAR 0114(0029)]
39	It is only a formality, but I still must test you\nto ensure that you can handle this job.\c\n[VAR 0100(0000)].\nMay I ask you to join me in a battle?\c\nI will wait until you are ready, so do whatever\npreparations you need and then speak with me.[VAR 0114(0029)]
40	You will want to prepare quite well for this.\nMy boss is a very tough lady.[VAR 0114(001F)]
41	So you’re ready for me?\nLet’s begin then, shall we?\c\nLet me see your talent in its entirety.\nNo need to hold back.[VAR 0114(0029)]
42	Thank you...\nI believe the testing is complete.[VAR 0114(0029)]
43	I see no problem at all with your skills.\nRather I would have to praise you for them.[VAR 0114(0029)]
44	I hope that we will do fine work together.[VAR 0114(0029)]
45	So now you are a member of our team, young\n[VAR 0100(0000)]! You are most welcome!\c\nThen there is no time to be wasting.\nLet us begin your first job!\c\nThe chief and I will set out to gather more\ninformation about the UBs.\c\nWe want to ask you to visit the secret labs in\nthe bottom of Aether Paradise![VAR 0114(001F)]
46	There you should find our other partner in this\nendeavor. The vice-chief of the Alolan branch\r\nof the Aether Foundation: Ms. Wicke.[VAR 0114(0029)]
47	She will know why you’ve come.\c\nNow set forth, young [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(001F)]
48	The lower floors of Aether Paradise.\c\nThat is where you must go to find the secret\nlabs and to meet with Ms. Wicke.[VAR 0114(0029)]
49	Welcome back.[VAR 0114(0029)]
50	It would seem that you managed to meet with\nMs. Wicke.\c\nI also expect Mr. Looker will return shortly...[VAR 0114(0029)]
51	È un disastro![VAR 0114(001F)]
52	Is...something the matter, Mr. Looker?\nIf you spoke in English, I might understand.\c\nWhat has you so bothered?[VAR 0114(0029)]
53	I’m sorry! It is a terrible habit I picked up.\nBut we do have a disaster in the making!\c\nSightings are being reported of another UB-01!\nIt is Symbiont!\c\nAnd the perp has been right here in Akala,\nright under our very noses![VAR 0114(001F)]
54	I understand.[VAR 0114(0029)]
55	Then, Mr. Looker. M[VAR 1100(00FF,0302)]r.iss [VAR 0100(0000)].\nIt looks like we have a job to do.[VAR 0114(0029)]
56	My task will be to protect the populated areas.[VAR 0114(0029)]
57	[VAR 0100(0000)]...\nyou will go to where the sighting was reported.[VAR 0114(0029)]
58	Mr. Looker, you are to stay here and coordinate\nour backup, if we should need it.[VAR 0114(0029)]
59	I...I see...[VAR 0114(001F)]
60	Backup is a vital part of any operation,\nMr. Looker.\c\nWe are entrusting our safety to you.[VAR 0114(0029)]
61	Yes, ma’am![VAR 0114(001F)]
62	Then I will be going ahead.\c\n[VAR 0100(0000)], stay safe![VAR 0114(0029)]
63	Good luck out there, Chief![VAR 0114(001F)]
64	Young [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nDo take care and keep yourself safe out there!\c\nIf you ever are in need of more information,\nyou may come talk with me![VAR 0114(001F)]
65	I’ve finished sending the data from the UB you\nprotected to HQ. And to Ms. Wicke as well.\c\nThank you for your hard work, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nWith this development, I think we will be able\nto solve the mysteries surrounding Nihilego.[VAR 0114(0029)]
66	Well! Regardless of all that, congratulations are\nin order, young [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nI, the great Looker, think I shall provide a great\nfeast to celebrate your great success and\r\nyour addition to our team!\c\nThere are some rather tasty restaurants here\non this island, after all![VAR 0114(001F)]
67	Oh? But how would you know that, Mr. Looker?\c\nWe have only just arrived in Alola...[VAR 0114(0029)]
68	Urm! I read about them in a magazine they had\nat the local Pokémon Center!\c\nD-don’t you worry yourself about the details!\nI’ll go and ask if they don’t do delivery.[VAR 0114(001F)]
69	My goodness...\nThat Mr. Looker...[VAR 0114(0029)]
70	Oh yes.\nThere was one other thing I wanted to tell you.\c\nThe original plan was that the UB you caught\nwould be collected by the International Police.\c\nHowever, we have been able to secure official\npermission for you to keep it, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0029)]
71	It was a bit of a hassle to get all the details\nironed out, but...\c\nIf we take the UB to headquarters, it would\nend up as a research subject.[VAR 0114(0029)]
72	I expect it will be much happier staying with\nyou, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0029)]
73	C’est une catastrophe![VAR 0114(001F)]
74	M-Mr. Looker...\nYes? What is it this time?\r\nIn English, if you please.[VAR 0114(0029)]
75	I’m sorry! It is just a habit of mine!\nBut never mind that—we have a disaster!\c\nI got a tip about a new UB sighting!\c\nThis time the sighting was on Melemele Island.\nI’m sorry, but we’ll have to put off our feast![VAR 0114(001F)]
76	I understand.\c\nLet us hurry to Melemele Island at once.[VAR 0114(0029)]
77	Yes, ma’am![VAR 0114(001F)]
78	I will go ahead to Melemele Island and set up a\nnew base of operations at the motel there.\c\nPlease join us there as soon as you’re ready,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0029)]
79	We make for Melemele at once!\nWe’re trusting in you, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nDon’t forget: the Melemele motel is on Route 2![VAR 0114(001F)]
562
0	Oh? Looks like you’re a trial-goer, eh?\nI’ve got a favor to ask of you then.
1	I’d be happy to help
2	I’m too busy
3	...Oh. So that’s how it is, eh?\c\nNo time to listen to an old lady’s problems,\nis that right?
4	Route 10 here is long and wide, and it’s a great\nplace to let your Pokémon play a bit.\c\nMy Stufful hadn’t been getting much exercise\nlately, so I let them out of their balls to have\r\nthem run around a bit...\c\nBut they haven’t come back!\c\nI want to go look for them, but it’s hard for\nan old lady like me to traipse all around...
5	If you find one of my little Stufful, you just tell\nthem to come back to me.\c\nThey’re impish creatures, but smart as a cookie\nand with noses that could sniff out anything.\r\nThey’ll find their way back home to me.
6	Will you help me find my Stufful along\nRoute 10?
7	Sure
8	I’m too busy
9	I’ve got [VAR 0200(0000)] Stufful lost out there somewhere.\nMaybe they’re hiding?
10	...Oh, I see.\nSympathy is a real rare commodity these days.
11	*sniff sniff*
12	Grrrr!
13	The Stufful ran off in a hurry...
14	Hmm...\c\nWell, [VAR 0200(0001)] of them have come back so far...\c\nBut where [VAR 1101(0002,0D0B)]is the lastare the other [VAR 0200(0002)] still hiding?
15	Oh! You, child!\c\nAll of my Stufful have made it back, thanks\nto you!
16	You’ve been a great help to me here.\nI surely do owe you, my young friend.\c\nHave this Muscle Band from me, as a token\nof my appreciation.
17	Cute and strong and just a little bit wild...\c\nThat’s what a Pokémon should be like!\nAnd that’s why Stufful is the best.
18	Glistening sweat! Slippery goo!\nThe perfect tune that keeps Hano Beach going!\r\nPyukumuku chuckers are desperately needed!\r\nWon’t you become a Pyukumuku chucker?
19	What’s that?
20	I’m too busy
21	Now that’s a shame!\nThe job pays pretty good, you know!
22	I’m one of the staff members responsible for\nkeeping Hano Beach spotless for our guests.\c\nBut Pyukumuku sometimes wriggle up on our\nbeach from the sea.\c\nI don’t know why they do it, but we can’t just\nleave them there.\c\nThey shrivel up on land and that’s not all...\nOur guests get grossed out seeing them and\r\nsometimes even get hurt stepping on them!
23	So we end up with no choice but to chuck\nthose poor Pyukumuku back into the sea!\c\nI’ll explain the job to you. It’s pretty easy.\c\nStep one! Catch Pyukumuku!\c\nStep two! Throw the Pyukumuku back into\nthe sea!\c\nStep three! Report back to me once every last\nPyukumuku on the beach is returned to the sea!
24	So what do you say? Think you’ve got what it\ntakes to be a Pyukumuku chucker?
25	Sure, I do
26	I’m too busy
27	Then get every last Pyukumuku on this beach\ndiving right back into the sea!\c\nLet’s see... I can still see [VAR 0200(0000)] Pyukumuku left on\nthe sand and in need of saving!
28	We really need some more hands to get this job\ntaken care of. Come back if you ever have time!
29	Puke?
30	Muke...
31	You chucked the Pyukumuku back into\nthe sea...
32	Hey there, part-timer!\c\nYou’ve gotten [VAR 0200(0001)] Pyukumuku safely back into\nthe sea so far.\c\nWhich means that you’ve still got [VAR 0200(0002)] more to\nreturn to the sea!
33	Good job, part-timer!\c\nYou’ve got every last Pyukumuku that was\nstranded on the beach back into the sea!\c\nNow they are safe back where they should be,\nand the beach is safe for our guests.
34	You’re a real good worker, you know?\nYou have a real knack for Pyukumuku chucking.\c\nAnd I’ve got your pay ready for you right here.\nTake it! You’ve earned it!
35	Pyukumuku are one of the most famous of all\nthe Alolan Pokémon.\c\nBut a lot of tourists from other regions don’t\nunderstand their appeal. It’s a real shame.
36	But no matter how many times we toss them\nback into the sea, they come wriggling back up\r\nthe next morning like clockwork.\c\nFeel free to come back and help again whenever\nyou have some spare time!
37	It looks like all of the Stufful have gone back\nto their Trainer...
38	It looks like all the Pyukumuku are gone from\nthe beach...
39	Back for another day working as a Pyukumuku\nchucker? I wish I could help you out with that...\c\nBut I’m so worried about that Pyukumuku that’s\nlooking downhearted that I can’t focus on work...
563
0	Thank you for joining us, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0029)]
1	Mr. Looker has already set out to gather more\ninformation about the UB.\c\nI have been waiting here on standby.\nI expect we will have another visitor soon.[VAR 0114(0029)]
2	A visitor?
3	Who?
4	A mysterious person who claims to have some\nknowledge of the UB.\c\nHe insisted that he would not share any more\ndetails with me until we met in person...\c\nBut if he does have any real insight into the UB,\nthen we cannot let this opportunity pass us by.[VAR 0114(0029)]
5	So I think it is best if you and I wait to take any\nfurther action now. And that we trust Mr. Looker\r\nto handle the fieldwork.\c\nThough I do feel bad asking him to do all the\nwork for us.[VAR 0114(0029)]

12	Monster...\c\nSo you were the one who reached out to us?[VAR 0114(0029)]
13	I forgot about this kahuna meeting we were all\nsupposed to go to.\r\nThat’s how I ended up stuck as the messenger.[VAR 0114(000A)]

19	It’s not like I’ve seen it or anything.\nJust heard rumors. You know.[VAR 0114(000A)]
20	Yes. So then...could I trouble you to tell us what\nit is that you do know?[VAR 0114(0029)]
21	What was it you guys were calling it?\nAbsorption or something?\c\nWell, you’ll find it in Melemele Meadow.\nNot just one of ’em either. Two of the suckers.[VAR 0114(000A)]
22	What was it you guys were calling it?\nBeauty or something?\c\nWell, you’ll find it in Verdant Cavern.\nNot just one of ’em either. Four of the things.[VAR 0114(000A)]
23	Wait... Wait just a moment!\c\nHow do you know our code names?\nThat is highly classified information![VAR 0114(0029)]
24	Hmph. No one wants to hear about that.\nGood luck.[VAR 0114(000A)]
25	Mr. Nanu was in fact a superior of mine when\nI first joined the International Police...\c\nI never dreamed that I would meet him once\nagain under circumstances such as these...[VAR 0114(0029)]
26	But if the information that he shared with us is\ncorrect, then there are multiple UBs this time.[VAR 0114(0029)]
27	The situation is dangerous.\nIf we don’t act at once...[VAR 0114(0029)]
28	¡Es un desastre![VAR 0114(001F)]

31	It appears that it might be UB Absorption!\c\nIt seems to be a UB of great strength and\nformidable muscles!\c\nBut that is not all...\nIt is not one creature, but two!\r\nIn Melemele Meadow![VAR 0114(001F)]
32	It appears that it might be UB Beauty!\c\nIt seems to be a beautiful yet dangerous UB\nthat can move at incredible speeds!\c\nBut that is not all...\nIt is not one specimen, but four!\r\nIn Verdant Cavern![VAR 0114(001F)]
33	So it appears that his information was correct...[VAR 0114(0029)]
34	Hm? What’s that?\nDid you say something just now, Chief?[VAR 0114(001F)]
35	No... It’s nothing.\c\nI understand, Mr. Looker.[VAR 0114(0029)]

38	[VAR 0100(0000)].\nYou will go to where the sighting was reported.[VAR 0114(0029)]
39	Mr. Looker, you are to stay here and act as our\nbackup once again, in case we should need it.[VAR 0114(0029)]
40	Hold it right there!\nNot again! This time I insist that I...[VAR 0114(001F)]
41	Please understand, Mr. Looker.\c\nYou do not have a partner Pokémon with you.\c\nI cannot allow you to operate in a place where\nyou are likely to encounter danger![VAR 0114(0029)]
42	And besides that...having such an experienced\nveteran as yourself serve as our backup is a\r\nvital task in an operation like this one.[VAR 0114(0029)]
43	Understood, ma’am![VAR 0114(001F)]
44	Then I must be off.\n[VAR 0100(0000)], I wish you fortune in battle![VAR 0114(0029)]
45	Good luck out there, Chief![VAR 0114(001F)]
46	You take these, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nI received them from Madam Wicke.[VAR 0114(001F)]
47	I trust that you will be careful out there, my\nyoung [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nAnd one last thing before you go...\c\nMadam Wicke finished analyzing all of the data\nthat we gathered on Nihilego, AKA UB Symbiont.\c\nIf you wish to learn more about that creature,\nyou should speak with Madam Wicke in the\r\nAether Paradise secret labs!\c\nNow it is time we get to work.\nAnd I’m here if you need to ask me anything![VAR 0114(001F)]
48	I’ve finished sending the data from the UB you\nprotected to HQ. And to Ms. Wicke as well.\c\nThank you for your hard work, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0029)]
49	With this data, I think we will be able to solve\nthe mysteries regarding UB Absorption...\r\notherwise known as Buzzwole.[VAR 0114(0029)]
50	With this data, I think we will be able to solve\nthe mysteries regarding UB Beauty...\r\notherwise known as Pheromosa.[VAR 0114(0029)]
51	Ugh...[VAR 0114(0029)]
52	What’s the matter, Chief?![VAR 0114(001F)]
53	I’m fine... I’m fine.\c\nThere were just so many of them this time that\nI was nearly run off my feet...[VAR 0114(0029)]
54	... ...[VAR 0114(001F)]
55	What? I’m fine, really!\nPlease don’t stare at me like that![VAR 0114(0029)]
56	Y-yes. Of course, ma’am.[VAR 0114(001F)]
57	You two must also be tired.\nWhat shall we do now?[VAR 0114(0029)]
58	If you are terribly exhausted, there is only one\nnatural conclusion to make...[VAR 0114(001F)]
59	The one thing that takes away all weariness!\nIt is, of course, a feast!\c\nThis time, indeed, we must have a great feast\nto celebrate our successful mission!\c\nAnd there is a restaurant here on this island\nwhere we can eat to our stomach’s content!\r\nI speak of course of the Battle Buffet![VAR 0114(001F)]
60	Oh? How curious. How is it that you are once\nagain so familiar with the local restaurants?[VAR 0114(0029)]
61	... ...\c\nI-it’s just by chance! The chanciest of chances!\nNot the Chansey-est, mind you. Just chance!\c\nN-never you mind that! The most important fact\nright now is that it is a very popular place!\r\nI will go at once to make a reservation![VAR 0114(001F)]
62	Mr. Looker is simply hopeless, isn’t he?[VAR 0114(0029)]
63	And Mr. Nanu...\c\nhe was an excellent police officer years ago.\c\nHe was on par with Mr. Looker even...back then.\c\nI’m really only here in this position now because\nof him...[VAR 0114(0029)]
64	Es ist ein Desaster![VAR 0114(001F)]
65	Oh? Mr. Looker?\nBack so soon again?[VAR 0114(0029)]
66	Could it be...[VAR 0114(0029)]
67	Yes, it could indeed! In fact it is, Chief!\c\nI’ve gotten a tip about another UB sighting!\c\nThis time it is on Akala Island!\nWe must delay our feast once again![VAR 0114(001F)]
68	Roger that, Mr. Looker.\c\nThen we must hurry to Akala Island at once.[VAR 0114(0029)]
69	Yes, ma’am![VAR 0114(001F)]
70	We will return to the motel that we formerly\nused as our base of operations on Akala.\c\nI hope you will join us there as soon as you are\nready, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0029)]
71	Back to Akala!\nWe are still counting on you, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nThe motel on Akala’s Route 8!\nThat is the place you must come![VAR 0114(001F)]
564
0	Oh! Here you are at last, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(001F)]
1	I’ve already been able to gather all of the intel\nwe need about the UBs this time.\c\nSo the chief has already left to help secure the\nsite and protect the surrounding areas.[VAR 0114(001F)]
2	Hallo![VAR 0114(0012)]
3	This precocious young lady here was my\ninformant this time![VAR 0114(001F)]
4	They sent me here on an errand.\nSince I’m not busy doing trials or anything.[VAR 0114(0012)]
5	Hmm?\nWho is that?[VAR 0114(001F)]
6	It’s a secret.\c\nOh, and I had one more order I was given.\nOr was it a request? Either way...[VAR 0114(0012)]
7	What might that be?[VAR 0114(001F)]
8	I was told I should have a real serious battle\nwith [VAR 0100(0000)] before I came back.\c\nI don’t really know why, but it seems like maybe\nit’s some sort of trial of strength.[VAR 0114(0012)]
9	So come on! Let’s have a battle!\nHave a Pokémon battle against me![VAR 0114(0012)]
10	Sure
11	Hold on
12	Shocking! You want me to wait?\nFine then. I guess I can wait.[VAR 0114(0012)]
13	Is that precocious young miss powerful?[VAR 0114(001F)]
14	All right!\nThen let’s get going already!\c\nTime for Mina to show you her full power!\nWe’ll get our Z on![VAR 0114(0012)]
15	Whoa, you’re surprisingly strong!\c\nThen it’s no problem.\nTurns out, you’re strong enough,\r\n[VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0012)]
16	It seems that my precocious young miss here is\nnot to be trifled with either...[VAR 0114(001F)]
17	OK, I’m out of here![VAR 0114(0012)]
18	She is rather odd, isn’t she?\nA real individual spirit...[VAR 0114(001F)]
19	But now we should get our heads on straight\nand get to work!\c\nI do not like it, but I am in charge of backup\nonce again![VAR 0114(001F)]
20	And for you, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nThe Beast Balls you will need for this mission![VAR 0114(001F)]
21	First, the regular reports, let us get them out of\nthe way, my young friend...\c\nMadam Wicke finished analyzing all of the data\nthat we gathered on the last UB you caught.\c\nIf you wish to learn more about that creature,\nyou should speak with Madam Wicke in the\r\nAether Paradise secret labs!\c\nAnd now it is time we get to work.\nIf you need to ask me anything, I am here![VAR 0114(001F)]
22	I’ve finished sending the data from the UB you\nprotected to HQ. And to Ms. Wicke as well.\c\nThank you for your hard work, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nWe should unravel the mysteries of Xurkitree,\nalso known as UB Lighting.[VAR 0114(0029)]
23	Ngh...[VAR 0114(0029)]
24	Are you all right, ma’am?![VAR 0114(001F)]
25	Y...yes...\nI’m fine, Mr. Looker.\c\nI just felt a passing vertigo...but I’m fine.\nPlease do not worry yourself.[VAR 0114(0029)]
26	But I must! I insist on worrying!\c\nYou have always had the stamina of a\nMachamp, Chief! I cannot believe this is nothing![VAR 0114(001F)]
27	No, please... It is nothing so serious...\c\nI’m sorry for causing you to worry about me.\nI insist that I really am fine...[VAR 0114(0029)]
28	Putting all that aside, I must say that we have\nfound a great ally in [VAR 0100(0000)].\r\nWhat a fantastic Trainer...\c\nIt was all that I could do to simply keep that\nXurkitree away from the town...[VAR 0114(0029)]
29	The UBs seem to get terribly aggressive when\nthey spot me...\c\nIt’s like they are treating me as prey or an\nenemy...[VAR 0114(0029)]
30	I...I am sure it is only your imagination, Chief!\nYou must be exhausted![VAR 0114(001F)]
31	[~ 31]
32	[~ 32]
33	...I let myself in.[VAR 0114(000A)]
34	Mr. Nanu...[VAR 0114(0029)]
35	You been keeping well?[VAR 0114(000A)]
36	Y-y-you are...[VAR 0114(001F)]
37	Heh. So it’s you, 100kr.\nOr...\r\nSorry. What is it now? “Looker”?[VAR 0114(000A)]
38	...Yes. It is.[VAR 0114(001F)]
39	What’s this? No smile for me?\c\nHere I am, coming out of my way to bring you\nthe info about the UB that you’re searching for.[VAR 0114(000A)]
40	Are you really?[VAR 0114(0029)]
41	That monster you’re calling Blade...\nIt’s on Ula’ula Island.\c\nI’ll tell you more when you get there.[VAR 0114(000A)]
42	That monster you’re calling Blaster...\nIt’s on Ula’ula Island.\c\nI’ll tell you more when you get there.[VAR 0114(000A)]
43	And your information...\nIt is all true?[VAR 0114(001F)]
44	I’m the kahuna of Ula’ula Island.\c\nIf you don’t do something about that monster\nfor me, our guardian’s not gonna be happy.[VAR 0114(000A)]
45	Thank you...for the information, Mr. Nanu.[VAR 0114(0029)]
46	See you around then.[VAR 0114(000A)]
47	... ...[VAR 0114(001F)]
48	Mr. Looker?[VAR 0114(0029)]
49	Yes...yes, ma’am?[VAR 0114(001F)]
50	Mr. Looker... Do I take it that you are acquainted\nwith Mr. Nanu?[VAR 0114(0029)]
51	I knew him once. I thought.[VAR 0114(001F)]
52	Never mind that...\nRight now we need to focus on our mission.[VAR 0114(001F)]
53	Of course... Yes, of course you’re right.\c\nIf we have reports of a new UB sighting, then\nour mission is our first priority...[VAR 0114(0029)]
54	I will move to Ula’ula island and prepare our\nnew base in the motel there.\c\nPlease join us there as soon as you are ready,\n[VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0029)]
55	I will go to Ula’ula...\nI trust that you will, as well, [VAR 0100(0000)]...\c\nThe motel on Ula’ula Island is on Route 13...[VAR 0114(001F)]
565
0	[VAR 0100(0000)].\nThank you once again for coming.[VAR 0114(0029)]
1	I’ve been waiting for you...[VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(001F)]
2	Once again we have already gathered the intel\non the UB we are targeting.\c\nMr. Nanu provided us with everything that we\nneeded to know.[VAR 0114(0029)]
3	The UB that has been sighted on this island is\nknown by the code name Blade...\c\nIt is a fearsome beast that is apparently able\nto cut through anything at all...\c\nAnd it was not a single sighting, either...[VAR 0114(001F)]
4	The UB that has been sighted on this island is\nknown by the code name Blaster...\c\nIt is a fearsome beast that apparently\npossesses a fearsome energy that will\r\nburn anything...\c\nAnd it was not a single sighting, either...[VAR 0114(001F)]
5	We cannot afford any delays.[VAR 0114(0029)]
6	I will protect the populated areas as usual.[VAR 0114(0029)]
7	[VAR 0100(0000)] will go to the site.[VAR 0114(0029)]
8	Mr. Looker, you will stand by.\nWe will ask you to handle backup.[VAR 0114(0029)]
9	Ngh![VAR 0114(0029)]
10	Are you all right, Chief?\nI think you are pushing yourself too far...[VAR 0114(001F)]
11	If you would agree, I would be happy to go into\nthe field myself this time and...[VAR 0114(001F)]
12	I’m fine!\nI can still handle this!\c\nI have you to watch my back after all, don’t I?[VAR 0114(0029)]
13	...Yes, ma’am.[VAR 0114(001F)]
14	Then I will be off now.\n[VAR 0100(0000)], I wish you fortune in battle![VAR 0114(0029)]
15	Do not push yourself too hard, Chief.\nPlease...be careful.[VAR 0114(001F)]
16	[VAR 0100(0000)], these are for you.\nYour Poké Balls known as Beast Balls for\r\nthis mission![VAR 0114(001F)]
17	First, the regular reports, let us get them out of\nthe way, my young friend...\c\nMadam Wicke finished analyzing all of the data\nthat we gathered on the last UB you caught.\c\nIf you wish to learn more about that creature,\nyou should speak with Madam Wicke in the\r\nAether Paradise secret labs!\c\nAnd now it is time we get to work.\nIf you need to ask me anything, I am here![VAR 0114(001F)]
18	I’ve finished sending the data from the UB you\nprotected to HQ. And to Ms. Wicke as well.\c\nThank you for your hard work, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0029)]
19	We should learn everything there is to know\nabout Kartana, also known as UB Blade.[VAR 0114(0029)]
20	We should learn everything there is to know\nabout Celesteela, also known as UB Blaster.[VAR 0114(0029)]
21	And...we have also had word from HQ.\c\nThere is only one UB left for us to take care of.[VAR 0114(0029)]
22	And we had our hands full with so many\nindividuals for this last UB...\c\nIt was a rather dangerous situation.\nBut you were all right, Chief?[VAR 0114(001F)]
23	Yes, of course!\nBoth me and my Pokémon were fine!\c\nOf course we ran into some difficult situations...\nBeing surrounded by the UBs and outflanked by\r\nthem made it rather touch and go for a while...[VAR 0114(0029)]
24	As I’d feared...[VAR 0114(001F)]
25	What is it, Mr. Looker?\c\nYou have been acting rather odd for a while\nnow, haven’t you?[VAR 0114(0029)]
26	Ah... No... It’s nothing.[VAR 0114(001F)]
27	Could it be...\c\nCould it be about our long-delayed feast?[VAR 0114(0029)]
28	Oh...\c\nYes! Yes, indeed! What a disaster that you\nhave found me out!\c\nThe truth is that I am starving, just starving!\nHow a Snorlax feels, I know exactly now![VAR 0114(001F)]
29	Hee... How hopeless you are, Mr. Looker.\c\nBut I suppose we have been putting it off for\nrather a long time. You must be hungry indeed.\c\nThen allow me to take point this time and find\na delicious restaurant for us all. ♪[VAR 0114(0029)]
30	Ah... Yes, ma’am! Thank you, ma’am![VAR 0114(001F)]
31	It’s a bit embarrassing to admit, but I’m actually\nquite famished myself!\c\nSo you two stay here and relax while I go and\nfind us a place to eat![VAR 0114(0029)]
32	The chief can’t take much more of this...\nShe must be exhausted.\c\nShe acts particularly cheery when she is feeling\nunwell to hide her weakness from others.[VAR 0114(001F)]
33	I know it may be a bit late for this...\nBut there is something I would like to tell you.[VAR 0114(001F)]
34	It is something that happened about 10 years\nago now...\c\nI came to the Alola region at that time as part of\na three-person team to eradicate a UB...[VAR 0114(001F)]
35	Of course we did not know them as UBs back\nthen. It was simply a dangerous creature.\c\nMy team succeeded in chasing down the UB.\nAnd then we tried to put an end to it...[VAR 0114(001F)]
36	But somebody screwed up.[VAR 0114(0030)]
37	Nanu...[VAR 0114(001F)]
38	This halfhearted fool here felt sorry for the\nmonster, even if only for a moment.\c\nThat moment was enough to get the third\nmember of our team done in by the UB.[VAR 0114(000A)]
39	This I cannot deny...\nI made an error of judgment.\c\nI failed to consider the fact that she was not\ntrained for combat...[VAR 0114(001F)]
40	She was just bait for the UB...[VAR 0114(000A)]
41	And the International Police knew it...\c\nThe UBs relentlessly seek out those who have\npassed through an Ultra Wormhole.\c\nThe passage must change them somehow...as\nthough they’ve been bathed in some energy...\r\nSomething that the beasts can smell or sense...\c\nIt is thought that the UBs can track such\npeople as though sniffing them out.[VAR 0114(001F)]
42	It’s not like the monsters come here by choice.\nThey don’t want to be here.\c\nSo they smell that familiar scent and think\nthere’ll be a wormhole. That they’ll get home.[VAR 0114(000A)]
43	Nanu, you called her bait...\nShe really was, wasn’t she?[VAR 0114(001F)]
44	Faller...[VAR 0114(000A)]
45	That is what the International Police calls them.\nHumans who appear from an Ultra Wormhole...\c\nand those who are bathed in a great deal of\nthe energy that pours out from them.\c\nShe had come through a wormhole.\nShe was from another world.\c\nAnd she was put on our team to help draw\nthe UB to us...[VAR 0114(001F)]
46	And now you’re repeating history.\c\nYou’ve got a Faller right here, haven’t you?\nThat’s right, boy. I’m talking about you.[VAR 0114(000A)]
47	And now you’re repeating history.\c\nYou’ve got a Faller right here, haven’t you?\nThat’s right, girl. I’m talking about you.[VAR 0114(000A)]
48	Yes...\nIt’s true. [VAR 1100(00FF,0201)]HShe passed through an Ultra Wormhole.\c\n[VAR 0100(0000)] was exposed to the energy,\nso [VAR 1100(00FF,0100)]she may indeed be a Faller.\c\nBut...[VAR 0114(001F)]
49	I’m back...[VAR 0114(0029)]
50	I’m sorry, young [VAR 0100(0000)].\nBut let us continue this talk another time.[VAR 0114(001F)]
51	I’m sorry, you two...\nI couldn’t get a reservation at the restaurant...\c\nIt seems like it’s a very popular place...[VAR 0114(0029)]
52	Hey, missy.[VAR 0114(000A)]
53	Mr. Nanu...\nI didn’t realize you were here.[VAR 0114(0029)]
54	Another one of those monsters appeared.\nThis time on Poni Island.\c\nI’ll tell you more when you get there. We’ll meet\nat the floating restaurant in Seafolk Village.[VAR 0114(000A)]
55	This next one seems like a real tough opponent.\nBe sure you’re ready for it.[VAR 0114(000A)]
56	O-oh... Yes, of course we will.\nThank you again, Mr. Nanu.[VAR 0114(0029)]
57	... ... ...[VAR 0114(001F)]
58	Um...Mr. Looker?\nIs everything all right?[VAR 0114(0029)]
59	Of course... It is fine...\nNot a problem at all...[VAR 0114(001F)]
60	Then I will make my way to the floating\nrestaurant at Poni Island.\c\nOnce you are ready, [VAR 0100(0000)], please do\ncome and join us there.[VAR 0114(0029)]
61	So it is on to Poni next...\nI will be counting on you, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nLet us meet again at the floating restaurant in\nSeafolk Village...[VAR 0114(001F)]
566
0	So you came...young [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(001F)]
1	The chief has already left to set up protection\naround the populated areas...[VAR 0114(001F)]
2	You sent her off to the wrong location?[VAR 0114(000A)]
3	What choice did I have?\nShe is reaching her limit.\c\nWe have to force her to stand by to regain\nher strength...[VAR 0114(001F)]
4	So now we can finish our little talk.\nYou’ve got one Faller right here...[VAR 0114(000A)]
5	and the other one is Anabel.\nThough I don’t think she knows it herself.[VAR 0114(000A)]
6	Nanu and I, we found her here ten years ago, \nunconscious on the shore of this very island.\c\nWe’d just finished our mission here.[VAR 0114(001F)]
7	... ...[VAR 0114(000A)]
8	She had lost most of her memories, but four\nthings she could tell us.\c\nThat her name was Anabel...\nThat she came from the Hoenn region...\r\nThat she had protected some tower there...\r\nAnd that she was a powerful Trainer...[VAR 0114(001F)]
9	Then she was placed under observation by\nthe International Police.\c\nAll because they detected an insane amount of\nUltra Wormhole energy from her.[VAR 0114(000A)]
10	It may be that she was wandering lost in the\nwormhole for some time...\c\nRegardless of that, she then entered the\nInternational Police herself.[VAR 0114(001F)]
11	And then got promoted right up past you, her\nsenior, is that it?[VAR 0114(000A)]
12	Gotta hand it to the International Police.\nThey really are terrible.\c\nUsing the same strategy and setting up another\nFaller, even though the same thing failed before.[VAR 0114(000A)]
13	Your assumptions, you are half right in.\c\nHowever...this mission, she chose herself.[VAR 0114(001F)]
14	... ...[VAR 0114(000A)]
15	Perhaps something in her laments, whether she\nis conscious of it or not...\c\nPerhaps she feels some grief over the fate of\nthe UB, which came to this world just as\r\nshe did.[VAR 0114(001F)]
16	But she is still a Faller.\nIt is her fate to be targeted by the UBs.\c\nWith a Faller right before them, the UBs will run\nwild with excitement.\c\nNo matter how good she might be, everyone\nhas their limits.\c\nThat is why I had hoped to distract the UBs—\nto divert some of their attention.[VAR 0114(001F)]
17	That is why I asked you to help with the\ncatching of the UBs...[VAR 0114(001F)]
18	But you’re out of luck now.\c\nWith Anabel in that condition...\nShe’ll be done for if she runs into any UBs now.[VAR 0114(000A)]
19	Hm...\c\nYes, and I imagine that the false lead I sent her\nout on will not buy us much more time...[VAR 0114(001F)]
20	But before we’re out of time, boy...[VAR 0114(000A)]
21	But before we’re out of time, girl...[VAR 0114(000A)]
22	How about a battle with me?[VAR 0114(000A)]
23	No problem
24	Why?
25	Why not?\c\nIf you’ve got some preparation you need to do,\nthen I’ll wait here for you.[VAR 0114(000A)]
26	Maybe you already know this, but that guy is a\nreal tough opponent when he’s being serious.[VAR 0114(001F)]
27	What a good little boy you are...[VAR 0114(000A)]
28	What a good little girl you are...[VAR 0114(000A)]
29	Then let’s go.[VAR 0114(000A)]
30	That’ll do, [VAR 1100(00FF,0403)]boygirl.\nI think that’ll do fine.[VAR 0114(000A)]
31	Don’t let me down.[VAR 0114(000A)]
32	I won’t...000.[VAR 0114(001F)]
33	Well then, young [VAR 0100(0000)]...\nIt is our time to get down to work, is it not?\c\nOur final UB. Code name: Glutton...\c\nNanu said he would lead it deep into the heart\nof Resolution Cave...[VAR 0114(001F)]
34	Here you are. As usual.[VAR 0114(001F)]
35	[VAR 0100(0000)]!\nThis is your final assignment!\c\nBut first, my young friend...let us get the regular\nreports out of the way.\c\nMadam Wicke finished analyzing all of the data\nthat we gathered on the last UB you caught.\c\nIf you wish to learn more about that creature,\nthen you should speak with Madam Wicke in\r\nthe Aether Paradise secret labs!\c\nAnd now it is time we get to work.\nIf you need to ask me anything, I am here![VAR 0114(001F)]
36	I’ve finished sending the data from the UB you\nprotected to HQ. And to Ms. Wicke as well.\c\nThank you for your hard work, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nNow we will be able to learn all there is to know\nabout Guzzlord, otherwise known as UB Glutton.[VAR 0114(0029)]
37	We’ve done it, Chief.[VAR 0114(001F)]
38	Yes...\c\nwe have successfully contained all of the UBs.[VAR 0114(0029)]
39	Thank you so much for all of your hard work\non these missions, [VAR 0100(0000)]...[VAR 0114(0029)]
40	And Mr. Looker...[VAR 0114(0029)]
41	Not at all!\nAll I did was provide backup to the two of you.[VAR 0114(001F)]
42	It was all you and [VAR 0100(0000)], Chief.[VAR 0114(001F)]
43	And now that we have finally completed our\nmissions, I will treat us all to a feast of—[VAR 0114(001F)]
44	One moment please.[VAR 0114(0029)]
45	Wh-what is it, Chief?\c\nWe have finally reached it—our grand finale!\nWhich we should end with a big feast...[VAR 0114(001F)]
46	Our truly final mission requires that we go to\nAether Paradise and report to Ms. Wicke that\r\nwe have contained all of the UBs.[VAR 0114(0029)]
47	Oh! Indeed you are right!\nAnd we must thank her for the Poké Balls\r\nknown as Beast Balls![VAR 0114(001F)]
48	We will be going to Aether Paradise to report to\nMs. Wicke about our success.\c\nIf you are free, why don’t you come along as\nwell, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(0029)]
49	We make for the secret labs in the lower floor\nof Aether Paradise!\c\nWhy don’t you join us, [VAR 0100(0000)]?[VAR 0114(001F)]

0	We have been waiting for you, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0016)]
1	[VAR 0100(0000)], thank you for coming.[VAR 0114(0029)]
2	I’d like to thank you first for all of your hard\nwork containing the UBs.\c\nOn behalf of the entire foundation, I would like\nto offer you our most sincere thanks.\c\nWith this, all the UBs that appeared from the\nUltra Wormhole, which opened in the earlier\r\nincident, have been caught.[VAR 0114(0016)]
3	Oh no, we’re the ones who should be thanking\nyou, I think...\c\nWe could not have done it without the use of\nthe Beast Balls that you provided for us.[VAR 0114(0029)]
4	They are negative assets of the foundation...\nI am happy to see them put to some good use.\r\nI hardly know how I can thank the two of you...[VAR 0114(0016)]
5	The three of us
6	Don’t forget Looker
7	Yes, Mr. Looker also did a great deal to help us\nwith this mission.[VAR 0114(0029)]
8	But I thought that he left before us.\nWhat is taking him so long to get here?\c\nI know that I told him that we would meet here.\nCould something have happened?[VAR 0114(0029)]
9	Taihen da![VAR 0114(001F)]
10	R-really, Mr. Looker!\nEven after all this time...[VAR 0114(0029)]
11	I’m sorry!\nI know it’s a terrible habit, but I can’t help it!\r\nAnd more importantly...it’s a disaster![VAR 0114(001F)]
12	I would imagine it must be.\nWhat happened that made you so late?[VAR 0114(0029)]
13	I was on the way here when I stopped by\nMelemele Island to get some of their famous\r\nand delicious malasada as a gift for you all...[VAR 0114(001F)]
14	But just when I had finished my purchase,\nI chanced to look up at the sky and there...[VAR 0114(001F)]
15	there it was![VAR 0114(001F)]
16	A mysterious black...something was zipping\nacross the bright blue sky over Alola![VAR 0114(001F)]
17	It was black and yet it was shining somehow!\nIt was...it was like it was refracting light![VAR 0114(001F)]
18	It might have been a UB!\nNo, I’m certain of it! It surely was a UB![VAR 0114(001F)]
19	But it couldn’t be...\nWe haven’t had any word from HQ about there\r\nbeing more UBs![VAR 0114(0029)]
20	Please rest easy.\nI do not think it was a UB.\c\nWe have a hundred of our foundation members\nworking in parallel with the International Police\r\ninvestigation and scouring Alola for UBs.\c\nWe have not detected any UBs other than\nthe ones that you already contained for us.[VAR 0114(0016)]
21	So you see?\nWe should be quite safe now.[VAR 0114(0029)]
22	I...I suppose...\c\nPerhaps I was just dazzled by the brilliant,\nshining sky that stretches over Alola...[VAR 0114(001F)]
23	And it is little wonder if you were dazzled.\nYou all have been working so very hard.\c\nYou must be very tired, Mr. Looker.[VAR 0114(0016)]
24	W-well...yes, I suppose I could do with a nice\nlittle break...[VAR 0114(001F)]
25	And now you can have it.\c\nI received a message from HQ saying that our\npaid leave has been approved.[VAR 0114(0029)]
26	Paid leave?! You mean...actual vacation time?![VAR 0114(001F)]
27	They say we are free to do whatever we would\nlike until we get our next orders from HQ.\c\nI hope you will also use this chance to relax\nfor a little while, Mr. Looker.[VAR 0114(0029)]
28	I think that I will stay here and have a good\nlook around the Alola region.\c\nNot for work this time, but just as a regular\ntourist doing some sightseeing.[VAR 0114(0029)]
29	Then I think that I will go and eat my fill of\ndelicious Alolan cooking!\c\nThere are simply too many restaurants and\neateries that I wish to visit!\c\nAnd the traditional dishes at Sushi High Roller\nare absolutely sublime![VAR 0114(001F)]
30	Sushi...High Roller?[VAR 0114(0029)]
31	Oh no! I completely forgot!\nI was supposed to be meeting someone![VAR 0114(0029)]
32	What’s this?! A date?![VAR 0114(001F)]
33	N-no! Not a date!\nI am meeting with Mr. Nanu!\c\nWe owe him quite a bit for all his help![VAR 0114(0029)]
34	Yes...I suppose we do.[VAR 0114(001F)]
35	So if you will excuse me...\n[VAR 0100(0000)], everyone...\r\nI’m afraid I must be going.[VAR 0114(0029)]
36	But I really do thank you all.\nI hope we will all meet again someday![VAR 0114(0029)]
37	Yes, my young [VAR 0100(0000)]...\nI also owe you my thanks.\c\nIt was because of your efforts that we were\nable to keep the chief safe until the end.\c\nThe folks at HQ thought that you needed to be\npaid for your work, so they sent this. Take it.[VAR 0114(001F)]
38	And now...I think that it’s time I went.\c\nI’ll be staying at the motel on Melemele Island,\nthough, so feel free to stop by anytime.[VAR 0114(001F)]

1	Mm-hmm... Mm-hmm!
2	I know! Look at you!\nYou look like a Pokémon Trainer with sense!
3	I’ve got something I’d like to ask a promising-\nlooking Trainer like you!
4	What do you say?
5	I’m listening
6	I’d rather not...
7	Hmm... Hrmmmmmmm...\nWell, that is a real shame...
8	Oh! Oh, thank you!\nThat’s wonderfully kind of you!
9	You see, I’m here doing some research on\nvarious Pokémon.\c\nI need to record the differences between 10\nspecies of Pokémon for my survey sample,\r\nbut I’ve been working so hard and my back is\r\njust killing me...
10	But then you came along!\c\nYou look like a sensible young Trainer, which\nis just the sort of person I need to help me!\c\nI’d like to ask you to catch 10 different species\nof Pokémon for me.\r\nIt’s not too much to ask, right?
11	Oh! But—! Oh, look at you! Already?!\c\nYou’ve already caught more than 10 species of\nPokémon! Then show me!
12	Oh, yes. This is perfect!\nThis is all the data that I needed. Thank you!
13	Here. Why don’t you take this?\nAs a little thank-you for helping me out.
14	I’m really grateful for your assistance, my\nsensible young Trainer!\c\nI look forward to seeing what a promising young\ngo-getter like yourself gets up to!
15	Good luck out there!
16	I want you to catch 10 different species of\nPokémon for me.\r\nAny kind that you like. Just 10 different ones!

1	I do!
2	I don’t
3	Then I have no choice but to admit that you are\nall I would expect you to be![VAR 0114(002B)]
4	Then allow me to inform you![VAR 0114(002B)]
5	Genesect is a Pokémon that lived 300 million\nyears ago.\c\nThen an organization called Team Plasma\nmodified it, attaching a cannon to its back.[VAR 0114(002B)]
6	The cannon’s abilities could be activated using\ncertain drives created by the scientists in the\r\nP2 Laboratory.\c\nI think that you might be able to use them as\nthey should be used.[VAR 0114(002B)]
7	Simply believing in your Pokémon will not\nguarantee that you can do everything you want.\c\nBut there are many things that are guaranteed\nto fail if you do not believe in them.\c\nIt is the trust between a Trainer and a Pokémon\nalone that can overcome those hurdles![VAR 0114(002B)]
8	You there!\nYou should know that there is a battle facility\r\non Poni Island called the Battle Tree.\c\nI look forward to seeing what kinds of Trainers\nand Pokémon I can encounter there![VAR 0114(002B)]
9	You there!\nYou know that there is a battle facility\r\non Poni Island called the Battle Tree, don’t you?\c\nI look forward to seeing what kinds of battles\nyou might have there![VAR 0114(002B)]

1	Oh! Listen to this! I’ve finally figured out the\nsecret of the pond in this garden!\c\nIf you could see this whole garden from above,\nthe pond here would look like a Pokémon!\c\nHow about I give you a little quiz?\nWhat kind of Pokémon does this pond look like?

3	Spinda
4	Pikachu
5	Crabrawler
6	Wingull
7	Mareanie
8	Gyarados
9	Pyukumuku
10	Sharpedo

12	Don’t just say you don’t know and give up!\nWhy don’t you try walking around the pond?
13	No way! You’re way off...\nWhy don’t you go have a good look at the pond?
14	Bingo! That’s it!\nGive the [VAR 1100(00FF,0403)]boygirl a prize!\c\nYou got the right answer! The pond in this\ngarden is totally shaped like a Gyarados!\r\nAnd to reward you...I’ll give you something nice!
15	And that’s the end of our quiz!\nGone as quick as an Air Balloon pops!\c\nMaybe I shouldn’t have made it a multiple-\nchoice quiz, after all. It was way too easy!
16	I wonder if whoever designed this garden really\nloved Gyarados or something?\r\nMaybe there’s some really deep meaning to it!
573
0	Ow! Arghhh!\c\nI’ve got dust in my eyes! Dust in my everywhere!\nEven my Pokémon are rubbing their eyes!
1	I’ve been getting so much dust in my eyes in\nthis awful desert, you know?\c\nAnd my Pokémon have been rubbing their\neyes a lot, too...\c\nHow are your Pokémon doing?\nAre their eyes holding up in this mess?
2	They’re burning brightly
3	They’re sniffling all the time
4	They’re looking pretty bleary
5	Well, that sounds like they might not be getting\nenough sleep. Warm them up and let them rest.
6	Wouldn’t that be their noses, not their eyes?\nIf they’ve got snot running down their faces,\r\nbe a good Trainer and wipe it away for them!
7	Well, that doesn’t sound good!\nI’ll give you these, so put ’em on your Pokémon.
8	This Haina Desert, though... It’s a beast.\nI’ve been wandering lost through it for...\r\nWell, I guess it’s been about a year now.\c\nWhen am I ever going to get out of here?
9	Ow! Arghhh!\c\nMore dust in my eyes! What I wouldn’t give for\na pair of Go-Goggles right about now...

0	This may be a bit sudden, coming from me,\nbut I’d like you to have these.
1	They are all items related to Pokémon that\nMadam Lusamine hoped to meet someday...
2	If you like, I can tell you what any of them does.
3	DNA Splicers
4	Prison Bottle
5	Soul Dew
6	No need
7	Ah, the DNA Splicers...\c\nThey are said to be able to fuse a Pokémon\ncalled Kyurem with either Reshiram or Zekrom.
8	Yes, the Prison Bottle...\c\nApparently it allows a Pokémon called Hoopa\nto change its appearance.
9	Yes, Soul Dew...\c\nIf the Pokémon Latios or Latias holds it, the\npower of their Psychic- and Dragon-type moves\r\nwill both go up by 20%.
10	You can also view the explanations for any\nof the items by checking them out in your Bag.
11	But you know...\neven if it comes from the desire to keep all of\r\nyour beloved Pokémon beside you always...\c\nusing Pokémon moves to put them into a\ncryogenic sleep is too much.
12	The Pokémon who sleep now...\c\nI will keep them safe so that they can someday\nreturn to their previous state...

0	It’s about time for them to start appearing...
1	Tally-ho!\nHey, friend! Isn’t this beach just the best?\c\nThat’s what you’d think, right?
2	But you’d be dead wrong if you did!\nThis beach has a dark secret behind it...\c\nDo you know this beach’s true form?\nThe one it takes on in the dark of night?
3	Hah! So you do know!\c\nYou can’t really know this beach if you only\nsee it during the day. Oh no, you can’t!
4	We make sure that people can enjoy the beach!\nAnd that Pokémon can live in peace!\c\nAnd you can help us do both at once, with one\nfantastic part-time job! What do you say?
5	Fine, fine. I won’t force you or anything.\nI can try to keep chucking ’em all myself...
6	Oh! Thanks a mil’, pal!\nThis job really wears a person out, you know?\c\nCan you wait around here until they start\nappearing? Should be any moment now...
7	You see? They gather quick as anything and\nbury themselves in the sand of the beach.\c\nIf we leave them like that, the tourists end up\nstepping on them as they flock to the beach.\c\nSo every night we chuck ’em back into the sea\nso they get back home safe.
8	You watching? So the most important thing is\nthat you grab ’em good...
9	then spin around real good before letting go\nto chuck ’em right back into the sea!
10	Kinda like the hammer throw, you know?\nDo your best!
11	Chuck all the Pyukumuku that’re on the beach\nback into the sea!\c\nI’ll reward you for your hard work if you do!
12	Now they won’t have to get all dried out on\nthe beach. Mm-hmm!\c\nWe do this every night, so come back again\nanytime you want to help!
13	Phew... I’m beat!\c\nChucking all these Pyukumuku by myself is\nenough to leave me dizzy!
14	Pyuk! Pyuku!
15	You spun around 10 times and then flung the\nPyukumuku back into the sea!
16	Looks like that last one you chucked really was\nthe last one on the beach.
17	Thanks, friend!\c\nChucking all these critters by myself leaves me\ndizzy as I can take!\c\nAnd here’s your reward for helping.
18	Once they’ve come to like a place, those\nPyukumuku will just keep on coming back to it.\c\nSo we end up having to do this every single\nnight. Come help again anytime you feel like it!
19	You gonna give up without finishing the job?

46	Hrmmmmm. Looks like I’ve got no choice!\c\nOur battle is not done here, but I suppose I’ll\nhave to let you take a little break!

0	Hurry! You’ve got to find it!\nOh my precious little Rocky!!!
1	I’ve never even heard of a Rockruff getting lost!\c\nEveryone says that they’re clever enough to\nsniff out their Trainers and return to them...
2	That’s why I’ve been saying that he was\nkidnapped! Pokénapped! Whatever!\c\nI was just a little distracted while shopping...\nand someone must have taken advantage of\r\nthat moment to steal my little Rocky!\c\nIt is simply too adorable! That’s why!\nIt must have been stolen from me by someone!
3	Well, I wouldn’t say it MUST be that...\nThere could’ve been an accident...\r\nor it could be lost or could have run away...
4	Ex-CUSE me?!\c\nRun away?! My little Rocky?!\nNever in a million years!!!
5	Well, it certainly is missing.\nWe don’t refute that.\c\nSo the question is what to do next...
6	Pardon the intrusion. Captain Ilima here![VAR 0114(000C)]
7	Wuff!
8	Oh! Captain Ilima! How good of up you stop by.\nDid you need something from Hau’oli’s finest?
9	It seems this adorable little Pokémon is looking\nfor its Trainer.[VAR 0114(000C)]
10	Is it indeed! I see!\nThen this must be...
11	Wuff!
12	Oh! Oh-oh-oh!\nROCKY!!!
13	Wuuuffffff!!
14	Allow Captain Ilima to explain.\c\nI found this little bundle of fur waiting for\nsomeone outside the apparel shop for ages.[VAR 0114(000C)]
15	...Y-you did?\c\nWell, yes, I suppose I did tell Rocky to wait\noutside the shop so that I could focus on my\r\nshopping and trying on outfits...\c\nand then four hours passed before I knew it.\nI’d completely forgotten about poor Rocky...
16	...\c\nMa’am...
17	Sounds like you had a tough day, Rockruff.[VAR 0114(000C)]
18	Wuff!
19	I-I’m so sorry, Rocky!\nI did it again, didn’t I! I’m a terrible mother!
20	Wuff!!
21	I’m so sorry for troubling you all!\nI made all this fuss and it’s all my fault!\c\nPlease, I want you to accept this.\nI hope this whole thing can be our little secret.
22	W-well, that takes care of that!\nI think I will absent myself now!
23	Come, Rocky!\c\nI’m going to fix you a veritable feast as my\napology for forgetting about you yet again.
24	Wuuuff!
25	Looks like that Pokémon’s got more sense in\nits head than its Trainer has in hers.
26	There are all kinds of Trainers, just as there\nare all kinds of Pokémon.\c\nI’ll just see myself out now.\nGood seeing you, [VAR 0101(0000)].[VAR 0114(000C)]
27	Most of my work comes down to finding lost\nkids or Pokémon, or helping lost tourists.\c\nThe only thing we never seem to lose in Alola\nis the peace and quiet! Same goes for today!
581
0	All right! I’d say we’re about done, yeah?\nLet’s call it a day and get on home.
1	Griiime...
2	Hey! What are you doing out here, kid?!\nThis is a restricted area! We’re working here!
3	Seriously, boy? Aren’t you a Malie native?\nWe are famous for our hospitality! Tch!\c\nAnd kids need to explore and see the world.\nHow else are they gonna learn? I swear...
4	Y-yes, Fath—er...I mean...sir! Yes, sir!\c\nIf that’s what you really want...then I will tell this\nrandom trespasser about what it is we do here.
5	This is where we take care of all of the garbage\nproduced in the Alola region, young [VAR 1100(00FF,0403)]manlady.\c\nWe Janitors work together with our Pokémon\ntoward this goal, in fact.\c\nThe garbage that the human workers gather is\nconsumed by Muk and Grimer, like this one here.\c\nOur president here beside me has a Muk that\ncan eat 10 tons of rubbish in a single day!
6	Though, me and Grimer here are still just\ntemporary contract workers...
7	...But isn’t that an island challenge amulet you\nhave there?
8	I took on the trials myself, when I was a kid!\c\nThough...it was a bit too much for me, and so I\nactually ended up giving up right away...
9	Look here, kid.\c\nSeems to me that my Muk’s had a bit too much\nto eat today...
10	How about you join me in a battle and provide it\nwith a bit of exercise to aid the ol’ digestion?
11	I’d be happy to
12	Not right now
13	What, you got other plans or something?\nLet me know if you change your mind.
14	Good! You’ve got chutzpah, my friend!\nThen let’s get this thing happening!
15	Heh! Not too shabby...just like I’d figured!\nYou’ve got something in you, kid.
16	Amazing... You even beat my fa—\c\nI mean, my boss’s Muk...
17	What’re you doing standing there like a lump?!\nYou’re up next, you useless dullard!
18	Wh-what?! Me... Me and Grimer?!\nThere’s no way we could win against this kid!
19	You see! It’s just like you did with your trials\nwhen you were a kid!\c\nThe moment something starts to look tough,\nyou give a cry and off you run! You give up!\r\nAnd you’re supposed to be my son!\c\nHow can I leave this plant to you if you never\nlearn the value of a bit of hard work?\c\nI can’t ever leave things in your hands if you\ndon’t give me reason to trust you can handle it!
20	F-Father...
21	... ... ...\c\nFine! We’ll do it!
22	I will not run away anymore!\nI will give this everything that I’ve got!
23	Then I’ll take you on
24	Give me a minute
25	I’m counting on you, kid. Help me out here.
26	I am a man now!\c\nJust you watch, Father!\nI mean, sir!
27	Blast it all!
28	You...
29	I...I’m sorry, Father...\nI really am...just a weakling...
30	You’re hired!
31	F-Father?
32	I’m not your father! I’m your boss!\nAnd I’m saying that you are hired, boy!\c\nFrom this day forth, I’m making you the head\nof the plant! And I won’t hear another word of\r\ncomplaint about it from you!
33	Wha—?
34	You saw that this Trainer was stronger than\nyou or even me...\c\nand still you and your Grimer went up against\nh[VAR 1100(00FF,0202)]imer with everything that you had in you.\c\nThat’s what I’ve always wanted to see from you!\nThat kind of persistence and drive!\c\nAnd that’s why you and Grimer...\nThat’s why you’re going to take over for me.
35	Th-thank you, sir! Father, sir!\nI mean, Mr. Former President, sir!
36	Sorry for using you to teach my boy a lesson.\c\nBut when I saw that island challenge amulet\nyou had there, it just hit me, you know?\c\nTake this for your troubles.\nIt may be twisted, but it’s not garbage!
37	Now that I’ve got my successor sorted out,\nI can finally retire to a life of peace and quiet.\c\nI think I can trust my boy’s crew to keep\non eating up all of Alola’s garbage from now on!
38	Yes, sir! You can, sir!
39	You again, young trial-goer!\c\nThanks again for helping me set my son to\nrights before.
40	Me and my Grimer have been working really\nhard ever since then.\c\nYou do your best, too.\nI’ll be hoping you succeed in your own dreams!
41	Gri-i-ime...
582
0	Are you a lucky person?
1	Then you probably can use this without any\nproblem.
2	Really? Then win luck over to your side\nwith this.
3	A Lucky Punch...\nIf you let Chansey hold this item, the critical-hit\r\nratio of Chansey’s moves will go up!\c\nYou’ll be really lucky!
583
0	Hey there, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nLooks like you’re really givin’ it your all. Yeah!\c\nYou’ve got a lot of Pokémon registered in your\nPokédex now![VAR 0114(0005)]

5	Hahaha! Rotom’s pretty fired up about it, too!\nOf course, I am, too! So I’ve got a little\r\nsomething for you.[VAR 0114(0005)]
6	When you have a Pokémon hold a Lucky Egg,\nit grows up faster! Some evolved Pokémon\r\ndon’t appear in the wild, so it’s useful to have\r\none of these if you’re trying to fill a Pokédex.[VAR 0114(0005)]
584
0	Well...I’m afraid that the little kerfuffle we went\nthrough resulted in my demotion.\c\nI am turning over a new leaf and beginning over\nas one of the rank and file.\c\nWhen all is said and done, I feel like I’ve become\na completely different person. In mind and body.[VAR 0114(0015)]
1	Could the new and improved Faba request a\nbattle with you?[VAR 0114(0015)]
2	Of course
3	I’d rather not
4	Then here I come!\nThe new and improved Faba makes his debut![VAR 0114(0015)]
5	No! Does my new and improved form so\nintimidate you?[VAR 0114(0015)]
6	So what did you think of the new and improved\nFaba, hmm?\c\nWith my newfound charm, you will see me\nmake my comeback within the foundation!\c\nAnd for that I will have to gain quite a bit of\nsupport behind me.[VAR 0114(0015)]
7	That is just a little token from me,\nso you won’t forget the new Faba.\c\nNow watch as I work my way up the ladder of\nthe foundation once more![VAR 0114(0015)]
8	When I was reduced to this low-ranking\nposition, I had a sudden revelation.\c\nI desperately long for that title of respect![VAR 0114(0015)]
585
0	Um, hey, sorry, but...\nYou’re part of Sis’s crew, right?
1	Sis?
2	Crew?
3	Oh, uh, sorry, guess I should explain...\nSee, I’m apprenticing here to become a cook.\c\nAnd Sis is the owner’s daughter. Mallow.\nHer family owns this restaurant, you know?
4	Oh, uh, sorry. I was in Team Skull, you know?\nSo I got kinda used to talking like that, yeah?\c\nI mean, you’re one of Mallow’s friends, right?\nI’m apprenticing here to become a cook.
5	Anyway, Mallow wanted me to give you this.
6	She said it was your reward for becoming the\nChampion, you know?\c\nBut she’s kinda shy, you know?\nSo she gave ’em to me to give to you.\c\nOh, but she told me I shouldn’t tell you that.\nSo forget about it—you got that?
7	Mallow, like, totally saved me.\nI wouldn’t be here if it weren’t for her.\c\nShe got me this job when Team Skull fell apart\nand I had nowhere left to go.\c\nOh, but she didn’t want me to tell anyone about\nthat either ’cause she’s so modest. Huh.
8	I’m gonna do my best now, and I’m gonna \nbecome a real chef. You’ll see!
586
0	You’re [VAR 0100(0000)]?\nThank you for helping out our Mallow.\c\nOh. I know!\c\nHere. Take this for stopping by.\c\nI already used it for making stock, but that\nshouldn’t stop your Pokémon from enjoying it.
1	It’s good to give Dragon-type Pokémon a\nDragon Fang to hold on to.\c\nThough we cooks tend to use them for rather\ndifferent purposes, as you can see!
2	I hope you and Mallow will stay friends!

8	Maybe later
9	Oh, what a shame!\c\nI’ll be here for a while, so come back if you\nchange your mind!

12	Kaw!
13	Oh! Hey, if you’d like, why don’t you have your\nPokémon hold on to this Metronome?\r\nIt could make your moves even stronger!

1	So you’ve defeated all of the Trainers along\nRoute 3, have you?\c\nYou have shaken me from my calm repose!\nMy heart was a still water, but no longer!
2	I feel my heart trembling!\nSo you’ve come again!
3	Shall we start?\nLet’s have a soul-shaking battle!
4	I accept
5	I refuse
6	My soul is calm and unruffled.
7	That is a good reply.
8	I will stand before you as a Roost move user!
9	It was a fine battle.\c\nMy heart feels as light and clear as the blue\nsky that appears after a storm passes through.
10	This is proof of the battle between your team\nand my own.\c\nTake it, my strong friend!
11	You will likely find other Trainers like me on\nthe routes of Alola. Searching for strength.\c\nChallenging them together with your Pokémon\nwould not be a bad reason to take a journey.
12	Hehehe...\nYou there!\c\nIn battle, the sky’s the limit! Are you ready to\nsend your opponent into the atmosphere?\c\nWhat do you say? Might you be interested in\nthe move Sky Drop?\c\nIf you are, beat every other Trainer on Route 8\nand we can talk.
13	You beat all of the Trainers along Route 8?\c\nThen it looks like it’s finally my time to shine!
14	What a wicked little Trainer you are for making\nme wait like that...
15	Now let’s get this thing started, shall we?
16	Yes, please!
17	No, wait!
18	If you make me wait too long then I’ll run out\nof power for my full-force attacks!
19	Then here I go!
20	It’s time for me and my Pokémon’s\nZ-Powered performance!
21	Well, that’s the end of me and my Pokémon’s\nZ-Powered performance!
22	Thanks for taking part in the show!\nTake this with you as a souvenir!
23	I bet you can find other Trainers who use\nparticular moves and items, just like me, on the\r\nvarious routes of Alola.\c\nWouldn’t it be fun to take a little detour and\nsearch them all out?
24	Looks like you’re a fellow Trainer who can use\nZ-Power in battle.\c\nLet’s find out whose full-force strength is the,\nuh, fullest!\c\nBeat all of the Trainers in this tunnel if you\nthink you can take me on!
25	Looks like you did what I asked and beat all of\nthe Trainers in this tunnel, huh?\c\nWell then, my Z-Powered challenger...\c\ndo you want to compare Z’s with me?\nWe’ll see whose Z is the best!
26	I’ve been waiting for you!\nTrainer who can wield the full force of Z-Power!
27	Then let us have a Z-battle to Z-prove who\nhas the best Z-Moves!
28	Let’s start
29	Hold on
30	Being cautious, are you?\nThen you must not have a lot of Z-Power!
31	That’s a good answer. But I hope you’re ready.\nMy Z-Power is not to be trifled with!
32	Our full-force Z-Power competition begins now!
33	Very well done! That is some real Z-Power!\nYour Z is the most Z of any Z!
34	Let me award you with this token to show how\nhighly I value and respect your Z!
35	There are probably other Z-Trainers like me out\nand about in Alola.\c\nIf you want to achieve the ultimate in Z, then\nsearch them out and challenge them all.
36	Dragon Tail is a move that’ll send an opponent\nflying in battle!\c\nDon’t you want to learn such a peerless move,\nthat no one can possibly stand against?\c\nIf you do, then beat every last Trainer on Route\n12 before you come talk to me again!
37	It appears you have completed your training\nand defeated Route 12’s other Trainers...\c\nThen I, the kahuna of Route 12, will honor you\nwith a battle!
38	I’ve been waiting for you.\nMy reckless little challenger.
39	I’ll show you the Z-Power of a Route 12 kahuna!
40	Let’s do it
41	I’m not ready...
42	And I was just getting warmed up, too!\nCome on, kid. Don’t make me wait too long...
43	Hee hee hee...\nSo you think you’re ready, do you?
44	This is the devastating Z-Power of the great\nkahuna of Route 12!
45	Rgh!\nI have been...done in...
46	I yield to you the title of Route 12 kahuna...\nand this as well...
47	I cannot allow myself to be satisfied with the\ntitle of kahuna in such a small area as this...\c\nI think it’s time that I start setting my goals\non the wider world as well!
48	Let me guess. You were wondering what a\nGolfer would be doing in a meadow like this.\c\nIf you want an answer to that question, then\ndefeat all of the Trainers in this meadow first.
49	Ho! Congratulations to you!\nYou’ve beat all the Trainers in the meadow!\c\nThen I’ll tell you why I am here...\c\nI am here waiting for a worthy Trainer like you!
50	Ho! So you’ve come again?\nI’ve been practicing my swing as I wait for you!
51	So what do you say?\nWill you have a Pokémon battle against me?
52	I will
53	No thanks
54	What, really?\nCome on! We should have a battle!
55	My special strategy hinges on my use of an\nitem called the Flame Orb!
56	This Golfer’s on fire!\nHere comes my full-powered best shot!
57	Mm-hmm. Just as I’d thought...\c\nYou have what it takes to be the next wielder\nof my precious Flame Orb...\c\nMm-hmm!\nI’m glad that I waited here for you so long.
58	Take it...my Flame Orb...
59	There! And that’s that!\c\nI don’t know if it’s simply a part of getting older,\nbut lately I’ve been completely hooked on golf.\c\nI’d gotten a bit burnt out as a Trainer and could\nno longer use that Flame Orb as I should have.\c\nUsing it wisely takes a bit of tricky thinking, but\nif you figure it out, it’ll pay you back in spades!
60	It takes a great deal of endurance and spirit\nto keep dancing without any pause. ♪\c\nIf you’d like to battle me, then you’ll have to\nshow that you have the endurance and spirit\r\nto rout all of the Trainers in the area first. ♪
61	Lovely. So you’ve defeated all the other Trainers\naround here, have you? ♪\c\nIt looks like you’ve got endurance and spirit. ♪
62	Oh, lovely. So you’ve come back to me! ♪
63	My Pokémon have plenty of endurance and\nspirit both. ♪\c\nEach also has a Focus Sash.\nWhat do you say? Will you try taking them on?
64	I’ll try
65	Not yet
66	Then be on your merry way. ♪\nI’ll be waiting here anytime. ♪
67	What a wonderful response! ♪\c\nI can’t wait to see just how long you’ll be able to\nstay on your feet against me and my team! ♪

69	Oh, how lovely! ♪ Just lovely! ♪\c\nYou and your team really do have a great deal\nof endurance and spirit. ♪
70	But I’ll still give you this so that you can reach\neven higher levels of endurance and spirit. ♪

72	Oh! You’re the one from the great composition!\c\nI just did a hundred sketches, so now I’m taking\na break.\c\nI beat all the Trainers around here, too, so now\nI’m totally bored again...\r\nI wish there was someone to go all out against.\c\nThat’s it! [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nIf you can beat all the Trainers around here, too,\r\nI’ll give you a battle against me![VAR 0114(0012)]
73	Oh! The one from the great composition!\c\nLooks like you’ve beaten everybody else in\nthis place, huh?\c\nThen have a battle against Captain Mina!\nLet’s get our Z on![VAR 0114(0012)]

77	Not yet!
78	OK, I guess I’ll wait.\nI’ll wait ri-i-ight here. And not move an inch.[VAR 0114(0012)]
79	Then here I go!\nI’m going all out, big-time![VAR 0114(0012)]
80	Me and my team are all full-powered to the max![VAR 0114(0012)]
81	Hrmmm! Well, this is frustrating.\nI failed to really use my full power...[VAR 0114(0012)]
82	But it was a fun battle, so take this, big-time![VAR 0114(0012)]
83	I’d like to draw a picture of the way you\nlook when you’re battling, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nLet’s have another full-power Pokémon battle\nagain sometime, yeah?[VAR 0114(0012)]
84	I’m one of the Trial Guides that’s here to help\nout young trial-goers on their island challenge.\c\nFeel like learning a mysterious move, maybe?\nIts effects change based on where you use it.\c\nLet’s see if you can beat all of the Trainers on\nRoute 5, for starters.
85	So you were able to beat everybody on Route 5\nat least, huh?\c\nThen I’ll give you a little trial of my own!
86	Hey, welcome back, friend.\nYou’re that trial-goer, aren’t you?
87	You think you’re ready to take on my little trial?\nI’ve got a Z-Power Ring myself, as you can see.
88	I’d be happy to
89	Please give me some time
90	Yeah, sure, no problem.\nI’ll be waiting here, so come back whenever.
91	I’d heard that the latest batch of trial-goers\nare a feisty lot. I’ve been looking forward to this!
92	This ol’ Trial Guide’s little trial is about to start!
93	That’s the end of my little trial!\nPhewee, you’ve got some solid skills, kid!
94	Yup, I’ve got to congratulate you on this win!\nHere’s a reward for clearing my little trial!
95	Seeing you young kids giving it your all like that...\c\nyou all shine as bright as the sun over Alola!\c\nThis may just be a volunteer position, but I’m\nsure glad that I decided to be a Trial Guide.
96	I’m one of the Trial Guides that are here to help\nyou kids out during your island challenge.\c\nBut the job that I was tasked with is actually\nto test how your skills are coming along.\c\nSo why don’t you show me you can beat every\nlast Trainer on Route 15? Then come back here.
97	Looks like you didn’t waste much time going\nthrough all the Trainers on Route 15!\c\nIf you’re that good, then I guess I’ll pull out my\nZ-Power, too.
98	Hey! Back again?\nHow’s it going, little trial-goer?
99	Think you can take on my little trial?
100	Yes, please
101	Not yet
102	You sure you’re up to this?\nPrepare real good before you come back.
103	I like your spirit, kid.\nI think I’m getting fired up, too!
104	Then the full-powered little trial of this Trial\nGuide is about to start!
105	Nice! You cleared my little trial.\nYou’re a real tough little trial-goer.
106	Here’s your reward from me.\nTake it and carry on with your adventure!
107	All the trial-goers I see out and about on their\nisland challenges have such great smiles...\c\nThey’re as beautiful as the brilliant moon that\nhangs in Alola’s night sky.\c\nThe work doesn’t pay a lick, but I can’t give it\nup when it lets me see those happy faces.
108	What? You want a little tête–à–tête with a\nZ-Power Ring user like yours truly?\c\nThen become the number two Trainer in all of\nPoni Plains, baby.
109	Looks like you managed to claw your way up\nto the number two spot in Poni Plains, huh?\c\nThen I guess you’ve earned a little rendezvous\nwith the number-one Trainer: me!
110	Hey, number two!\nYou planning to make me wait forever?
111	What do you say?\nIs it time for our little showdown?
112	Let’s battle!
113	Not yet!
114	OK...but I’m not going anywhere.\nThe number-one Trainer doesn’t run away.
115	You can’t just choose the cool-looking Pokémon\nand think you can win...
116	The full power of the number-one Trainer is\ngoing to finish you off for the day!
117	Oh, baby! I’ve gotta give you a hand!\nYou are worthy of being the next number one!
118	So here you go, babe.\nA little present from me!
119	There aren’t too many Trainers who’ve mastered\nusing their Z-Power Rings.\c\nSo don’t forget I’m one of those special few!\nPlease, baby!
120	Sorry, youngster, but I can’t fight you.\c\nMy Pokémon are like brothers to me.\nAnd they’re not interested in battling weaklings.\c\nIf you want me to ask them to fight against you,\nthen beat all the Trainers on Mount Hokulani.
121	Are you the one who defeated all the Trainers\non Mount Hokulani then?\c\nAll right then. Fair enough.\nI like kids with a bit of pep.
122	Made me wait, didn’t you?
123	I’ll be using my Z-Power against you.\nYou ready for a scuffle?
124	Sure I am
125	Not yet
126	Hmph. Fine, kid.
127	I think I feel something coming over me...
128	Sorry, kid, but my Pokémon don’t know the\nmeaning of the word “moderation”!
129	You...\nYou’ve got some good Pokémon, kid.
130	Thanks for showing my brothers a good time.\nHere’s your thanks.
131	You know, Z-Power is more or less the power\nof the pledge you’ve made to your Pokémon.\c\nAnd my relationship with my Pokémon is closer\nthan that of a parent or a brother or anything.

0	Miss Lusamine can be rather egotistical, I find.\nDon’t you think that someone like me, who\r\nalways has the foundation’s best interests in\r\nmind, would be more fitting for the position?[VAR 0114(0015)]
1	You’re right
2	You think so?
3	You are surprisingly intelligent for a child![VAR 0114(0015)]
4	This is why I hate dealing with child—\c\nEr, I mean...\c\nI find it so interesting talking with children.[VAR 0114(0015)]
594
0	So you came...[VAR 0114(0013)]
1	I guess I’ve got to thank you again for all you’ve\ndone for my family...\c\nEspecially...for Lillie.\c\nI never knew she could smile like that.[VAR 0114(0013)]
2	My mother’s desires to reach Nihilego...\nand what she did in order to achieve that goal...\r\nI know she was completely out of control.\r\nBut that doesn’t mean I can’t understand it.[VAR 0114(0013)]
3	It was my father who started it.\c\nHe was the one who first confirmed the\nexistence of Ultra Wormholes and Ultra Beasts.[VAR 0114(0013)]
4	But my father...\c\nHe disappeared during an experiment.\nTrying to connect to an Ultra Wormhole.\c\nAll that he left behind was a weakened Cosmog\nand his papers about Nihilego...[VAR 0114(0013)]
5	Lusamine’s obsession with Ultra Wormholes...\nand her obsession with the Ultra Beasts...\c\nI think it was all basically her way of trying to\nreach him again.\r\nThat’s what I had to believe. To get through it.[VAR 0114(0013)]
6	It’s not an apology or anything, but...\nI hope you’ll take this fellow.[VAR 0114(0013)]
7	[~ 7]
8	And I’ll give you all the memory drives that let\nits Evolution, Silvally, change its type...[VAR 0114(0013)]
9	You received a whole stack of memory drives!
10	This is a different Type: Null.\nNot the same one that I ran away with...\c\nIt was kept in Secret Lab A. Its very existence\nwas a secret.[VAR 0114(0013)]
11	But I think I know you well enough.\nI think I can trust you to show it the world.[VAR 0114(0013)]
12	Hmph...\c\nMaybe it’s time I see a bit more of the\nworld myself...\c\nand starting with that Pokémon League, I think.\c\nI hear that Alola’s got a real strong Champion.[VAR 0114(0013)]
13	You can’t even take Type: Null?\nHow many Pokémon have you collected?\c\nI can’t even believe you...\c\nFine. Come back when you’re ready to take it.[VAR 0114(0013)]
595
0	M[VAR 1100(00FF,0305)]asteriss [VAR 0100(0000)].\nWelcome back.[VAR 0114(0016)]
1	Young Master Gladion also left something with\nme for you. It is Type: Null.[VAR 0114(0016)]
2	I’ll also entrust you with all of the memory drives\nneeded to change the type of Type: Null’s\r\nEvolution—the Pokémon Silvally.[VAR 0114(0016)]
3	You received a whole stack of memory drives!
4	Type: Null...\c\nIt was being researched as a possible weapon\nto be used to fight the Ultra Beasts, but I think\r\na Trainer like you, [VAR 0100(0000)]...\c\nMaster Gladion thinks you will be able to show\nType: Null that there is much more to this wide\r\nworld than that.[VAR 0114(0016)]
5	But you have so many Pokémon already that\nyou cannot accept Type: Null now.\c\nPlease come back to get it.\nI will be here, in Aether Paradise.[VAR 0114(0016)]
6	Master Gladion left to travel Kanto and Johto,\nso far away from here...[VAR 0114(0016)]
7	For training?
8	Taking a vacation?
9	Yes, that’s right!\c\nHe went to defeat Trainers like you, young\n[VAR 0100(0000)], and Master Hau.\c\nHe chose to go on a journey to train himself,\nrather than take part in Alola’s island challenge.[VAR 0114(0016)]
10	If you do the same thing as everyone else,\nit is unlikely you will surpass them...\c\nI think Master Gladion must remember the tales\nI have told him of catching Pokémon in regions\r\nlike Kanto and have been inspired to action.[VAR 0114(0016)]
11	Honestly, I cannot imagine Master Gladion ever\ntaking a vacation...\c\nBut I know he can make it anywhere he goes on\nhis own...\r\nNo. Not on his own. With his Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0016)]
12	I’ve heard that he even patched up his own\nclothing when it got torn up by his partner,\r\nType: Null...\c\nMaster Gladion is once again taking charge of\nhis own life and is this time heading to Kanto\r\nand nearby regions to train himself.
13	I have to tell you how much I appreciate what\nyou did for Miss Lillie and Madam Lusamine.[VAR 0114(0016)]
14	Miss Lillie asked me a last favor before she left.\c\nShe wanted me to explain to you why\nshe and her mother had to go to Kanto.[VAR 0114(0016)]
15	You see...\c\nwhile we do not know if it was because of\nNihilego’s neurotoxins, her fusion with that\r\nbeast, or the strain of the Z-Power...[VAR 0114(0016)]
16	the ill effects of this episode on Madam\nLusamine’s body and mind have been undeniable.\r\nShe has hardly roused since.[VAR 0114(0016)]
17	But Miss Lillie found a ray of hope in a book\nthat she remembered reading long ago.[VAR 0114(0016)]
18	It was regarding a man named Bill, who invented\nthe Pokémon Storage System used in our PCs.[VAR 0114(0016)]
19	This inventor, who lives in the Kanto region,\nonce combined himself with a Pokémon in an\r\nexperiment that apparently went awry...[VAR 0114(0016)]
20	Just like Lusamine...
21	Why would he do that?
22	Yes, perhaps there are even more examples in\nthe world of people fusing with Pokémon...[VAR 0114(0016)]
23	I suppose it was the same sort of curiosity\nthat led him to develop our storage system.[VAR 0114(0016)]
24	The records of this event, however, say that\nhe was separated from the Pokémon by using\r\nhis Teleporter and a Cell Separation System.[VAR 0114(0016)]
25	Perhaps using the same kind of procedure on\nMadam Lusamine will be able to remove the\r\nlast of the beast’s poisons from her system.\c\nThat is what Miss Lillie was hoping when she\nheaded to Kanto.[VAR 0114(0016)]
26	It pained me greatly when both Miss Lillie and\nyoung Master Gladion left Aether Paradise...\c\nbut I am so proud to see the fine young people\nthat they have become.[VAR 0114(0016)]
27	Even sheltered little Master Gladion tried to\npatch up his own clothing, he said, when his\r\npartner Null tore them...[VAR 0114(0016)]
28	Oh! I’m sorry. You probably aren’t interested\nin hearing about that sort of thing, are you?\c\nHere, please accept this.[VAR 0114(0016)]
29	... ... ...\c\nOh! And take another, too![VAR 0114(0016)]
30	Now I’ll be returning to the conservation area\nto look after the Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0016)]

5	It’s so mysterious...\c\nto be talking about Mega Evolution here, in a\nregion so far away from Kalos...[VAR 0114(0026)]
6	But we are Trainers.\c\nRather than explaining it all in words, why don’t\nwe just show you what Mega Evolution is![VAR 0114(0027)]
7	The Trainer holds the Key Stone!\c\nThe Pokémon holds the Mega Stone!\c\nAnd that’s how you can make your Pokémon\nMega Evolve during battle![VAR 0114(0027)]
8	You can use the Z-Power Ring!\c\nSo you must be able to use a Key Stone that\nmakes Mega Stones resonate![VAR 0114(0026)]
9	If you have a Key Stone, you’ll be able to make\nyour Pokémon that hold a Mega Stone\r\nMega Evolve![VAR 0114(0027)]
10	This is a Mega Stone that makes Alakazam\nMega Evolve. It’s called an Alakazite!\c\nI’ll give the Key Stone and an Alakazite to you![VAR 0114(0027)]
11	You know, when you think about it, the Z-Power\nRing helps the feelings of a Trainer reach their\r\nPokémon so it can use its Z-Move, right?\c\nIt only follows that it should be able to achieve\nMega Evolution, too![VAR 0114(0026)]

0	You reached out and touched the statue...
1	Tapu ko-ko-ko-kooo!!!
2	Tapu Koko disappeared...
3	There is no reaction from the statue...
605
0	So... I see you’ve had [VAR 0202(0000)] battles against\nother Trainers...
1	It seems you understand how Pokémon types\nmatch up perfectly!
2	Oh ho! And you take advantage of Pokémon’s\nAbilities in battle, too!
3	I wonder if any Trainer can defeat you\nand [VAR 0101(0001)]!
4	You’re so powerful... You may have gotten the\nattention of the tapu.
5	How...how powerful can one become?! You\nseem to have pursued victory above all else!
6	Battle after battle...even when you have to\nstop, it’s not long before you’re up and at it.\c\nKeep striving for victories—find something there\nthat only you can find!
7	I see... You’ve had more battles than I could\npossibly count!
8	Now then... I wonder if you can seize victory\neven from me?
9	I will
10	I don’t think so
11	No need to force yourself if you’re not feeling it.\nThat’s important if you want to keep winning.
12	I’ve also experienced many battles—maybe even\nmore than you!\c\nNow, it’s time to see who is truly the better\nPokémon Trainer! No holding back!
13	Everything will work out, if you choose to keep\nfighting for victory! Oh, and speaking of choice,\r\nlet me give you Choice Specs! If a Pokémon\r\nholds them, they’ll be stuck using only the first\r\nmove they chose in battle, but their Sp. Atk will\r\nbe boosted by 50 percent!
606
0	What is a TM?\c\nTo get the answer to that question, you should\nobtain a lot of TMs!
1	Let me ask you a question.\nHow many TMs do you have?
2	You don’t even have 10 TMs... Hmm...\nYou can buy TMs at some Poké Marts.
3	I see, I see. You have [VAR 0201(0000)] TMs!\c\nAsk for a Ride Pokémon’s help, and look all over\nfor TMs.
4	Oh! You have [VAR 0201(0000)] TMs!\c\nRumor has it that there is a place somewhere\nin Alola where strong Trainers gather and\r\ncompete against each other.\c\nI’ve heard that you can obtain various\nTMs there.
5	Wow! You have [VAR 0201(0000)] TMs!\c\nYou’re a great Trainer! You use TMs to show\na whole new world to your Pokémon!
6	TMs... They can teach moves to Pokémon just\nby using them... What are they, really?
7	Do they bring out Pokémon’s potential to use\nmoves?\c\nAssuming that’s so, if they are used on a\nhuman like you, can you learn a move...?\c\nI guess we can’t try that.
8	Love TMs, and teach a lot of moves to\nyour Pokémon!
607
0	Yes, it’s me, Ilima.[VAR 0114(000C)]
1	Congratulations once again on completing the\ntrial, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(000C)]
2	I have a favor I would like to ask of such a\nlovely Trainer.\r\nYou would be willing to help me out, right?[VAR 0114(000C)]
3	I would like you to go to the deepest part of\nVerdant Cavern instead of me, the captain,\r\nand place a piece of Normalium Z on the\r\npedestal that is found there.[VAR 0114(000C)]
4	And so... I give you this.[VAR 0114(000C)]
5	I’m afraid I have to take the stage to fill a\nlittle role in my mother’s place.[VAR 0114(000C)]
6	But there are many young trial-goers starting\ntheir island challenge now, inspired by your\r\nsuccess, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nDon’t let them down![VAR 0114(000C)]
7	I’m the Trial Guide.\c\nThank you for helping out our captain this time.
8	All you need to do is place the Normalium Z you\ngot from Ilima on the pedestal deep inside.\c\nHowever, you WILL be attacked by the Totem\nPokémon! To the totem, any and all who enter\r\nare opponents who must be defeated. That’s\r\nwhat it means for a captain to train a totem!
9	But you made it through your own trial,\nright, [VAR 0100(0000)]?\c\nI’m sure you’ll be fine!\nNow let’s test what you’re really made of!
10	You feel a piercing gaze that seems to cut right\nthrough you...but from where?
11	Will you place the Z-Crystal on the pedestal?
12	[VAR 0101(0000)], the Totem Pokémon of\nVerdant Cavern, has appeared!
13	Thhhh!
14	Thhhh!
15	[VAR 0101(0001)] disappeared back into the\ncave somewhere...
16	Will you place the Z-Crystal on the pedestal?
17	You reached out to place the Z-Crystal on\nthe pedestal!
18	What an incredible Trainer you are!
19	Hahaha!\nDid I sound like Captain Ilima just now?
20	But you did just as well as we might have\nexpected, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nEven the totem that Ilima has been training up\nwas no match for you.
21	In the place of our captain, I present you with a\nfine gift so all may know what a great job you\r\ndid for us!
22	You received a Trial Guide Cap and a Trial\nGuide Tee!
23	You received a Trial Guide Cap and a Trial\nGuide Tee!
24	We’ll be sure to call on you again the next time\nwe need a favor done!
25	Head right into the heart of Verdant Cavern,\nand place that Normalium Z on the pedestal![VAR 0114(000C)]
26	Well, look at you, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nYou could not only pass for a captain...\nEven that Trial Guide outfit fits you to a tee.\r\nUntil we meet again, then.[VAR 0114(000C)]
27	The Normalium Z that you placed on the\npedestal for Ilima is glittering brightly!

3	It’s SO cute and lovely and smart, it’s almost too\nmuch to take!\c\nOh! Sorry! Once I start bragging, oh, how the\ntime does get away from me!\c\nAhem!\nNow, as I was saying...
4	Are you taking photos of your favorite\nPokémon for them?\c\nThe more photos you take of your Pokémon at\nthe Alola Photo Club, the more affectionate\r\nthey become toward you!\c\nIn fact, I can see how affectionate your Pokémon\nare feeling toward you. Mm-hmm...
5	Impossible!\c\nY-your [VAR 0101(0000)] is just as affectionate\ntoward you as Meowth is toward me!\c\nIf you love your Pokémon that much then I must\nname you a member of the Pokémon Fan Club!\c\nWhich means that I should also give you access\nto our exclusive heart-themed background,\r\nwhich only our members can use for photos!\c\nYou should head off to an Alola Photo Club at\nonce to snap some shots with your Pokémon!
6	Ahhh, but your Pokémon could still be more\naffectionate toward you than it is now.\c\nBecome true friends with that Pokémon, and\nI’ll recognize you as a proper Pokémon Fan!
7	W-would you like to hear about how wonderful\nmy Meowth is?
8	Oh!\c\nYou see, my favorite Meowth here is the cutest!\nIt’s SO cute and lovely and smart, it’s almost\r\ntoo much to take!\c\nPlus, it’s really just amazing when you stop to\nlook at it. Don’t you think so?\c\nOh yes. Its looks are so stunning and its heart\nso kindly, you can’t help but love it!\c\nAnd when you hug it tight when it’s sleeping,\nit’s so warm and cuddly...\c\nPlus, it looks spectacular when you pose\ntogether with it in photos, of course.\c\nOh, and it’s simply ravishing when...
9	...Oops! Look at the time!\nI kept you too long!
10	Oh...\nWhat a shame...
11	Ho! You’re not only a Champion in battle\nbut even an ace at loving your Pokémon!\c\nBut I won’t be outdone when it comes to loving\nPokémon the most. I’m the true Champion there!

0	Greetings, trial-goer!\nI’m afraid this is a captain’s barricade.\c\nOnly those who pass the Ghost-type trial\ncan come through here.
1	Ho! That’s Ghostium Z right there!\c\nThen let me just get this thing out of the way\nfor you! One second...
2	I’ve even got a special gift for a Trainer like you,\nwho managed to clear Acerola’s trial!\r\nWhich would you like to take?
3	Fresh Water
4	Normal water
5	Here’s a Fresh Water for you!
6	Fresh Water gets expensive because it has to\nbe shipped here to Alola over the ocean.\c\nThe Fresh Water from Mt. Silver is really great.
7	Oh! Sorry...\nThe normal water is actually mine!\r\nBut I’ll give you this Fresh Water instead!
8	I store up this normal water by catching my\nPoliwhirl’s Water Gun and filtering it through\r\ncloth into a cup. Water is precious in the desert!
9	Oh, and take an Adrenaline Orb, too!\c\nIf you use one, it’ll make wild Pokémon more\nlikely to call allies in battle.\c\nAnd the Pokémon they call are sometimes extra\nstrong or even different-colored Shiny Pokémon!
10	Beyond this gate stretches the great expanse\nof Haina Desert.\r\nIt’s a bit different every day, due to the wind...\r\nOr maybe it’s the snorting breath of Tapu Bulu!
11	Alola, Champion!\c\nBeyond this gate stretches the great expanse\nof Haina Desert.\r\nIt’s a bit different every day, due to the wind...\r\nOr maybe it’s the snorting breath of Tapu Bulu!

2	Your opposing Pokémon have called for help\ncountless times!
3	Wild Pokémon...\c\nThey call for help when they’re backed into a\ncorner—for example, when their HP goes down.
4	But a Pokémon with a status condition—such as\nbeing poisoned, paralyzed, or asleep—won’t call\r\nfor help...
5	Just between you and me...\c\nthere may be some Pokémon that you’ll never\nencounter unless they are called on for help!
6	Here, take these Adrenaline Orbs!

3	No matter how many times I see it,\nthe Master Ball just takes my breath away!
4	Oh, yeah, Ultra Balls are awesome!\c\nWhat’s so cool about them is that they’re\ntwice as effective as normal Poké Balls, and\r\nfour times as expensive!
5	The Great Ball is just great, isn’t it?\nYeah, the Great Ball is really great.
6	How about that, a Poké Ball! And\n[VAR 0101(0000)] is inside it!\c\nIt’s the most basic way of catching Pokémon,\nbut basics are really important!\c\nI hear there are some Pokémon Trainers out\nthere who use only Poké Balls to catch\r\nall of their Pokémon!
7	H-hey, a Net Ball! It makes catching\nWater- and Bug-type Pokémon easier,\r\nfor some reason.\c\nMaybe it makes them feel safe, just like\nif we were using a real net!
8	Ooooh, a Dive Ball! Makes catching Pokémon\nthat live underwater a lot easier.\c\nDid you meet [VAR 0101(0000)] while fishing?\nOr maybe while going for a cruise on\r\nyour Ride Pokémon?
9	Nest Balls are sooooooo nice! Catching low\nleveled Pokémon has never been easier!\c\nI also like that it loses its effect if a Pokémon is\nabove Lv. 30! I mean, how can it even tell?
10	Oh, a Repeat Ball! These are always interesting.\nThey make catching Pokémon you’ve already\r\ncaught before a breeze!\c\nSo, does that mean you’ve caught a bunch\nof [VAR 0101(0000)]?\c\nI don’t know if you’ve caught on, but I use\nthe words catch and caught a lot!
11	You can have a good time with Timer Balls!\nThe longer a battle with a wild Pokémon\r\nlasts, the better your chances of catching it!\c\nIt’s super good for Pokémon that keep restoring\ntheir HP during battle!
12	Oh, a Luxury Ball! Really showing your\nPokémon that you care!\c\nIf you keep a Pokémon in a Luxury Ball in your\nparty, it’ll grow friendlier a lot quicker!\c\nI bet it’s super luxurious and comfy in there.
13	Premier Balls look so chic! Although I always\nwonder... What sort of event is it supposed to\r\nbe commemorating?\c\nStill, the sleek, white design is super cool!
14	Oh, a Dusk Ball... Good to use at night...or in\ncaves... Y’know, dark, gloomy environments...\c\nMakes catching Pokémon there easier...
15	A Heal Ball, I see! Taking good care of your\nPokémon, eh?\c\nIt heals up both a Pokémon’s HP and PP,\nmaking them ready for battle immediately!
16	Oh, hey, a Quick Ball! Here’s a haiku about it\nfor you.\c\nPokémon Trainers\nshould use a Quick Ball quickly\r\nfor met Pokémon.\c\n...It’s the best I could do, OK?
17	Wow, a Cherish Ball! Poké Balls made to\ncommemorate a really special occasion...\c\n[VAR 0101(0000)] looks really comfy in there.\nI bet it’s a really special Pokémon, too!
18	Oh look, a Fast Ball! Those are handy,\naren’t they?\c\nGreat for when you want to capture those\nPokémon that are a little too quick on their feet!\c\nIf the Pokémon’s Speed is over 100, you\ngotta use a Fast Ball!
19	Oh, a Level Ball! This is an interesting one!\nThey make catching Pokémon that are at a\r\nlower level than your Pokémon easier.\c\nI always wondered how that works. Maybe\nthe Level Ball has some sort of powerful aura!
20	Nice, a Lure Ball! This ball makes going\nfishing a breeze!\c\nSo, where did you fish up [VAR 0101(0000)]?
21	A Heavy Ball! Those are neat! This is definitely\nthe Poké Ball to use for heavy Pokémon!\c\nBut wait... Even if you catch a super heavy\nPokémon, the Poké Ball’s weight\r\ndoesn’t change...
22	Aww, a Love Ball! How nice! It works best when\nthe wild Pokémon is the same species, but\r\nopposite gender, of your own Pokémon.
23	A Friend Ball! Those are so nice! Any Pokémon\nyou catch with it is instantly your friend!\c\nThat means the Return move’s power is\nbumped up to 80, too!
24	A Moon Ball! This is a very unique Poké Ball.\nThis ball is good for catching Pokémon that\r\nevolve when you use a Moon Stone.\c\nThat means Nidorina, Nidorino, Clefairy,\nJigglypuff, Skitty, and Munna!
25	A Beast Ball?! What is that?!\nI bet it’s a beast of a ball!
26	Oh, that is a Poké Ball you don’t see often!\nI can feel the weight of history from it!\c\nI guess you and [VAR 0101(0000)]\ngo back a long way, huh?

1	Hey hey, what’s your deal? I was literally\nabout to buy that!\c\nIf you got a problem, you’re gonna have to\nbattle me!
2	Yeah, I got a problem!
3	Nah, no problem
4	All right, see ya.
5	All right, here I come!
6	Hey, what’s your deal? If I give you my pocket\nmoney, how am I supposed to buy what I want?!\c\nYou should buy this Strange Souvenir.\nI’ll literally sell it to you for $100!
7	I’ll literally buy it!
8	Literally not interested
9	Wow, what a letdown!
10	Wow, you literally can’t even afford it!
11	Wow, thanks a lot! Just $100 is all I need to get\nwhatever my heart desires!
12	Hey, y’know that Strange Souvenir? I hear that\nit’s modeled after a guardian deity that lives\r\ndeep in the desert on Ula’ula Island.

0	I’d really love to see an unbelievable Mantine\nSurfer, skilled enough to take the top-ranked\r\nspot in every one of Alola’s four Surf Spots!
1	I’ve heard about you, kid.\c\nYou’re the one who took the top-ranked spot\nin all four of Alola’s Surf Spots...\c\nCongratulations! They call me the Boss...\nI’m also a surfer beloved by the Mantine and\r\nthe sea itself, but not as much as you!
2	I’ve got the perfect Pokémon for you...\nI’ll give you a Pikachu that knows Surf!\c\nI hope you’ll make it one of your partners!
3	Ack! You can’t take another Pokémon now?\nCome back when you’ve got space for one.
4	Oooh, I know! And I’ll teach you a trick I used\nto always use!\c\nSpin in each different direction in turn, and see\nwhat happens.\c\nTry that, and beat your own best record, kid.\nThat’s what I’d like to see you do now.\c\nMe and this Pikachu that knows Fly will be\ncheering for you when you do!
5	Bigachuuu!
619
0	Seeing the vending machine makes me think...\ndo you think a Rotom ever tried going in there?
1	The vending machine seems to be out of order.
2	I wonder when they’re ever going to fix this...\nIt’s way more convenient to be able to use the\r\nvending machine anytime you want to.
3	Oh, you have a Z-Power Ring...\nMaybe you could fix the vending machine?\c\nHa ha, that’s so stupid, right? I know that\nthe two have nothing to do with each other.
4	Wait...is that one of those rare Rotom Dexes?\nDoes it have the Pokémon Rotom inside it?
5	You called, zzt...?[VAR 0114(0035)]
6	You called, zzt...?[VAR 0114(0035)]
7	You called, so I’m here, zzt![VAR 0114(0035)]
8	You called, so I’m here, zzt![VAR 0114(0035)]
9	It does!\c\nHey, hey!\nDo you think you could ask Rotom to help?
10	You think he can fix it?
11	You think he can go in there?
12	Sure I can! Zz-zzt![VAR 0114(0035)]
13	Sure I can! Zz-zzt![VAR 0114(0035)]
14	Who d’you think you’re talking about, zzrt?![VAR 0114(0035)]
15	Who d’you think you’re talking about, zzrt?![VAR 0114(0035)]
16	Rotom zipped into the vending machine faster\nthan your eyes could even follow!
17	Zzt zzt...[VAR 0114(0035)]
18	Oh? Interesting. Seems like it doesn’t actually\nchange forms when it’s in a vending machine?
19	You know a lot about Rotom, huh?
20	Yeah, looks like it
21	Oh, you see...\c\nI was actually a bit involved in making the parts\nfor the Poké Finder’s zoom function.
22	All done, zzt![VAR 0114(0035)]
23	Oh! Looks like it’s done.\c\nDo you think it worked?\nDo you think Rotom fixed it?
24	I’ll press the button for a Fresh Water, and...
25	Oh? Hmm. It’s not cold.
26	But it’s still all thanks to Rotom!\nSo here, you take it!
27	But this experience really makes me think that\nRotom hold far greater potential than we ever\r\ndreamed of before... Almost limitless potential!\c\nIt’s already become a Pokédex here in Alola.\nI wonder what it might zip right into next?\r\nMaybe a PC Box? Hah!
28	Come on. Please?\nWon’t you give your Rotom a tap and call it out?
620
0	There are many reasons why a Trainer might not\nbe able to return to their Pokémon, but when\r\nthat happens, either we have a relative take\r\ncare of them or we let them go from their\r\nPC Boxes.
1	But there’s one Pokémon that won’t go back to\nthe wild, no matter how many times we try to\r\nrelease it...
2	Cooped up in its Box, with nobody coming to\nget it... That can’t be good for the Pokémon.
3	It would be great if there was someone who\nknew its Trainer...
4	Do you want me to look?
5	That’s terrible...
6	There’s only so much I can do, even as a\nfoundation employee... So to be honest, I’d love\r\nit if you could help us out.
7	Thank you so much. Please, take this Poké Ball...
8	I wonder sometimes... Does the relationship\nbetween Pokémon and Trainers never change,\r\neven when one of them goes missing?
9	The Trainer who passed away... All we know is\nthat he was from Ula’ula Island. I hope you can\r\nfind something...
10	Hey, Mom? Do you know how Granddaddy’s\nPokémon are doing? I hope they’re OK...
11	I don’t know... Maybe they’re going on another\nisland challenge, with a new Trainer.
12	Dartrix jumped out of the Poké Ball entrusted\nto you!
13	Hoo...
14	Dartrix! You’re Granddaddy’s Dartrix,\naren’t you?!
15	Wait, why do you have Granddaddy’s Dartrix?!
16	You explained how you were entrusted with the\nPoké Ball.
17	You liked Granddaddy so much, you didn’t want\nto go anywhere, huh...
18	Well, don’t worry, Dartrix! From now on, I’ll be\nwith you all the time!
19	For the island challenge?
20	To battle?
21	I don’t know! All I know is I just want to be with\nit, all the time!
22	Heh heh...
23	You returned Dartrix to its Poké Ball.
24	You handed over the Left Poké Ball.
25	Thank you!
26	Here, take this Mental Herb in exchange!
27	Dartrix, you have to tell me all about my\ngranddaddy! Like, why did he never evolve you\r\ninto a Decidueye?
28	I can’t believe it couldn’t leave the Box, because\nit was so attached to my father... It seems like\r\na strong bond can be a burden, sometimes...
621
0	Have you been having a good time?\nYou look a bit tired but happy.\c\nTake a little break before you head out\nthere again.
1	Here. Take a [VAR 0109(0000)], too, sweetie.\nI hope you’ll encounter someone special today!
622
0	I can’t agree to giving you my daughter’s hand\nin marriage unless you prove your strength to\r\nme in battle. And that’s that.
1	Ugh! Dad! I can give myself away...\nand I don’t need your blessing to do it!\c\nWould you stop judging everyone just by how\nstrong their Pokémon are?!
2	Th-that’s right, um, sir...\c\nOur Gastly love one another, and so do we!\nSo...
3	Eek!
4	Look! If all you want from a marriage partner is\nstrength, then this kid should do, right?\r\n[VAR 1100(00FF,0201)]HShe’s got a Z-Power Ring, after all!
5	Th-that’s not the point at all! Don’t you go trying\nto pull that kind of Switcheroo on me!\c\nSure, when Pokémon use Switcheroo, they can\nswap held items, but I’m not fool enough to just\r\nswap one prospective spouse for another!\c\nDon’t try to make excuses!
6	What about you?! Claiming that you can’t rest\neasy if I don’t marry a strong Trainer is just an\r\nexcuse, too!
7	Please, trial-goer!\c\nWould you beat my dad in battle so he can blow\noff some steam and finally listen to reason?
8	Got it!
9	How is this my problem?!
10	Don’t worry! You’ve got this!\c\nAnd I’ll make sure your Pokémon are all healed,\nsince you’re fighting in our place.
11	Ridiculous...\nThis is insane even for my daughter.\c\nBut I completed the island challenge once!\nI’ll take you on, [VAR 1100(00FF,0403)]boygirl! Show me what you’ve got!
12	Are you feeling a bit calmer now, Dad?\nSee, even if we aren’t the strongest...\r\nwe want to do our best, just the two of us!\r\nNo, the four of us! With our Gastly, too!
13	Come on, honey!\nLet’s go get our marriage license!
14	Th-that’s right!\nAnd our Gastly can be together, too!
15	Phew... You understand, don’t you, kid?\nYour work’s not over once you catch a Pokémon.\c\nIt’s by battling and taking that time together\nthat you really get to know one another...\r\nand I’d say that a marriage is just the same.\c\nBut I just don’t know how to talk about those\nkinds of things with my baby girl.\c\nAt least I’ve shared my nugget of wisdom with\nyou, kid. And this glittering Nugget, too.
16	Now...I just have to see if I can summon up a\nsmile at the wedding ceremony...\c\nFool kids. If they both brought out their Gastly,\nthey probably could have beat me, too...
17	When our Gastly evolve, we should trade them\nwith one another!
18	If you use moves like Foresight or Odor Sleuth,\nNormal-type moves can hit Ghost types, too!
623
0	Hiyah! I challenge you to a battle!
1	I accept!
2	I decline!
3	Master! It is as you said—the true art of battle\nis to triumph without even fighting!
4	Master, please lend me your strength!
5	Master, I am sorry... I have failed you...
6	Grrourrr![VAR 0114(0047)]
7	Trainer!
8	This is Master Bewear, to whom I have\nbecome an apprentice...
9	And who is a master of a mysterious, wild\nform of martial art...\r\nknown only as the Pokémon style!
10	Grrourrr![VAR 0114(0047)]
11	Master was generous enough to act as my\nPokémon just now, but be warned!\c\nShould Master wish it, he could break\neven the most brawny of men in twain!
12	Hm, what’s this? Do I see in your possession\nFightinium Z?! \c\nProof that you have completed Kahuna Hala’s\ngrand trial!
13	Kahuna Hala and my master are rivals of old!\c\nBack in the day, they fought for one week\nstraight without pause, before calling it a draw!
14	Grrourrr![VAR 0114(0047)]
15	As you wish, Master!
16	My master says that you have proven your\nstrength and are worthy of learning\r\none of his many moves!

26	This holds the essence of my master’s\nteachings! Use it well.
27	TM66 is for Payback!\c\nIf you can attack after an opponent, the move\nbecomes twice as powerful!\c\nA good move for Pokémon with low Speed.\nMay you be stronger the next time we meet!
28	Master!

0	Waaaaaaah! Daddy!\nI want to know more about [VAR 0101(0000)]![VAR 0114(003E)]
1	Oh, ah...what shall I do?\nIs there someone with [VAR 0101(0000)]?[VAR 0114(003C)]
2	Would you like to show your Pokémon\nto them?
3	Waaaaaaaah![VAR 0114(003E)]
4	Thank you!\c\nBut if it’s possible, please show him a Pokémon,\nnot an Egg!
5	Oh!\nThank you very much!\c\nLook, Son! It’s a Pokémon![VAR 0114(003C)]
6	Waaaaah! Daddy!\nIt’s [VAR 0101(0001)]!\c\nIt doesn’t look like [VAR 0101(0000)] at all![VAR 0114(003E)]
7	Hmmm...\nYou’re right.\c\nOK. Daddy will be [VAR 0101(0000)] then.[VAR 0114(003C)]
8	Look. Ooh-ooh-ahh-ahh![VAR 0114(003C)]
9	*sniffle*\nYou’re weird...[VAR 0114(003E)]
10	Oh!\nThank you!\c\nLook, Son! It’s [VAR 0101(0000)]![VAR 0114(003C)]
11	Wow! It’s [VAR 0101(0000)]!\nYay, yay![VAR 0114(003E)]
12	That was great, right?[VAR 0114(003C)]
13	Daddy! Why is this Pokémon\ncalled [VAR 0101(0000)]?[VAR 0114(003E)]
14	Ah... Well... That’s because...\c\nLong ago, some Passimian had a lot of Apicot\nBerries to share. One held out his hand, and the\r\nothers said, “Pass him an Apicot.”\c\nSomebody overheard “Pass him an” and\nfigured that was their name, I guess.[VAR 0114(003C)]
15	Ah... Well...that’s because...\c\nlong, long ago, Oranguru knew a lot about\nOran Berries, so people started calling the\r\nPokémon an Oran...guru... Maybe...[VAR 0114(003C)]
16	Wow... Great! I get it![VAR 0114(003E)]
17	Oh, thank you, mister.\nPlease take this.[VAR 0114(003E)]
18	Oh, thank you, miss.\nPlease take this.[VAR 0114(003E)]
19	When I grow up, I’m gonna be\n[VAR 1302(0000)][VAR 0101(0000)]![VAR 0114(003E)]
20	I should learn more about Pokémon...[VAR 0114(003C)]
625
0	Off in the faraway Johto region, see, there is\nthis amazing craftsman who smiths Poké Balls\r\nfrom special Berries.[VAR 0114(003B)]
1	What, really? You mean they don’t all come from\nthe factory in Kalos?[VAR 0114(003E)]
2	Hey, you! You Trainer, there!\nWill you listen to this?[VAR 0114(003E)]
3	Ho ho ho! I’m sorry to just spring this on you,\nbut do you know of the rare GS Ball?[VAR 0114(003B)]
4	Of course!
5	GS Ball?
6	Oh! So you already know of Kurt, the masterful\nPoké Ball smith who is the pride of the\r\nJohto region![VAR 0114(003B)]
7	Yes, the GS Ball...\c\nIt is indeed the greatest smith’s ball.\nThat is what we call the GS Ball.[VAR 0114(003B)]
8	That’s the greatest!
9	Is that true?
10	Well...there are also those who might call it\nthe Gold-Silver Ball, but...[VAR 0114(003B)]
11	So which one is right?![VAR 0114(003E)]
12	Truth is in the eye of the beholder, my boy.[VAR 0114(003B)]
13	Young Trainer, I’m sorry that we delayed you\non your journey.\c\nLet me share something great with you to make\nup for it.[VAR 0114(003B)]
14	It’s a Premier Ball, crafted to commemorate a\nspecial occasion of some sort![VAR 0114(003B)]
15	I once tried to throw a Master Ball at another\nTrainer’s Pokémon.\c\nIt was blocked and rebounded away, with the\nstrict warning not to act like a thief...[VAR 0114(003B)]
16	If you’re buying Poké Balls at a Poké Mart,\nyou should buy them in sets of 10![VAR 0114(003E)]
626
0	Oh, your Eevee. It hatched from an Egg.
1	Let me see...\nIts Ability is Run Away.
2	Let me see...\nIts Ability is Adaptability.
3	Let me see...\nIts Ability is Anticipation.
4	Other Eevee can have a different Ability.\c\nOh, I have a great idea!\nI’ll give you an Evolution stone for your Eevee.\c\nWhich one do you want?
5	Fire Stone
6	Thunder Stone
7	Water Stone
8	OK. You want a [VAR 0109(0000)]!\nHere it is!
9	Eevee is a Pokémon that has the potential to\nevolve into one of many different Pokémon!
627
0	Hey, do you know about the Everstone?
1	I do!
2	What’s that?
3	That’s right!\c\nIf a Pokémon holds it, for some reason\nthe Pokémon doesn’t evolve.
4	You don’t know?\c\nIf a Pokémon holds it, for some reason\nthe Pokémon doesn’t evolve.
5	And well, I’ve stumbled upon another\nsecret of the Everstone!\r\nI’ve been itching to share it with someone!
6	You see, I’d left my Gyarados at the nursery\nwhile it was still holding an Everstone.
7	And whenever I hatched an Egg that was found,\nthe Pokémon always had the same Nature as\r\nmy Gyarados! Isn’t that strange?
628
0	So this is Aether Paradise...\nA fine facility you have here, Madam President![VAR 0114(002F)]
1	I... ... ...[VAR 0114(0014)]
2	Is something...the matter?[VAR 0114(002F)]
3	N-no, nothing...\nYou’re here for...a tour today?[VAR 0114(0014)]
4	Yes! Please call me Mohn.\c\nI operate a series of islands known as Poké\nPelago, where we take care of Pokémon.\c\nBut nothing comes close to the care offered at\nAether Paradise, after all![VAR 0114(002F)]
5	Hey there, [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nYour Pokémon enjoy Poké Pelago, don’t they?[VAR 0114(002F)]
6	Sure do!
7	Well, uh...
8	Ha! OK! Sorry about that!\nI suppose I put you on the spot there.[VAR 0114(002F)]
9	Oops! I guess I shouldn’t put you on the spot\nwhen we’re right in front of the president!\r\nI don’t expect you to pick sides or anything![VAR 0114(002F)]
10	This is fascinating, though...\c\nI let the Pokémon mostly do as they please back\nat Poké Pelago, so I’m not sure how much I can\r\napply of what you do here at Aether Paradise...\c\nBut it’s a fine facility indeed![VAR 0114(002F)]
11	Heh heh... Is that so?\c\nWell, Aether Paradise is primarily designed for\nPokémon conservation efforts, after all.[VAR 0114(0014)]
12	Though...[VAR 0114(0014)]
13	Though...?[VAR 0114(002F)]
14	No matter how hard we might work to heal a\nPokémon, in the end, it may simply end up stuck\r\nin some PC Box somewhere, depending on the\r\nwhims of its Trainer.\c\nSometimes I can’t help but think on that...[VAR 0114(0014)]
15	I see...\c\nIt’s true that each Trainer does end up deciding\nwhat to do with the Pokémon they catch...\c\nI suppose I’ll just have to find more islands,\nso I can expand Poké Pelago and care for even\r\nmore boxed Pokémon there![VAR 0114(002F)]
16	When that time comes, I do hope that we might\nbe able to work together, ma’am.[VAR 0114(002F)]
17	Well, this has been a stimulating visit indeed!\nThank you very much for your time, ma’am.[VAR 0114(002F)]
18	Just...one last question...[VAR 0114(0014)]
19	Is this...\c\nIs this your first time to visit Aether Paradise?[VAR 0114(0014)]
20	Indeed it is. Why do you ask?[VAR 0114(002F)]
21	No, no reason...\c\nDon’t let me keep you any longer.\nAnd thank you for coming.[VAR 0114(0014)]
22	Until we meet again, then![VAR 0114(002F)]
23	Are you sure?\nAbout leaving things like that?[VAR 0114(0013)]
24	Yes.[VAR 0114(0014)]
25	After all, the way he smiles now...\c\nIt’s quite lovely, don’t you think?[VAR 0114(0014)]
629
0	Oh! [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nYou look well.[VAR 0114(0006)]
1	Hey there, Champion! You already know how\nrad Z-Moves are, yeah?[VAR 0114(0005)]
2	Yup!
3	Uhh...
4	So those Z-Crystals you collected on your\nisland challenge are comin’ in handy![VAR 0114(0005)]
5	Well, I guess you don’t have to use the\nZ-Crystals you collected on your\r\nisland challenge.[VAR 0114(0005)]
6	But where does the awesomeness of Z-Moves\ncome from? That’s been one of the themes of\r\nmy research into Pokémon moves.[VAR 0114(0005)]
7	It all starts with your Z-Power Ring, yeah,\nforged from the Sparkling Stone you got straight\r\nfrom Tapu Koko![VAR 0114(0005)]
8	When you use your Z-Crystals, it brings you and\nyour Pokémon together![VAR 0114(0005)]
9	Yes, it seems that some sort of invisible bond is\ncreated between a Trainer and their Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0006)]
10	Yeah, a Trainer sends their physical and mental\nenergy, and their Pokémon are surrounded by\r\nan aura![VAR 0114(0005)]
11	So, what is it that allows a Trainer to send their\npower to a Pokémon?[VAR 0114(0006)]
12	Sparkling Stone?
13	Z-Power Ring?
14	Yeah, it’s that Z-Power Ring, made from a\nrefined Sparkling Stone, that changes a Trainer’s\r\npower into light and gives their Pokémon\r\nan aura![VAR 0114(0005)]
15	Then there is the light pouring into Alola from\nthe Ultra Wormhole that Solgaleo opened up...[VAR 0114(0006)]
16	Then there is the light pouring into Alola from\nthe Ultra Wormhole that Lunala opened up...[VAR 0114(0006)]
17	That’s an important point!\c\nCould Sparkling Stones have also come through\nthe Ultra Wormhole and landed here in Alola?[VAR 0114(0005)]
18	Long, long ago, Necrozma lost part of its body—\nat least that’s what the Ultra Recon Squad said.[VAR 0114(0006)]
19	If you combine my theory with what we’ve\nheard from the Ultra Recon Squad...[VAR 0114(0005)]
20	The Sparkling Stones themselves might be that\npart of Necrozma’s body that it lost![VAR 0114(0006)]
21	If that’s the case, then Necrozma...\c\nWhen it’s with you, [VAR 0100(0000)], it can get\nback that part of itself that was once lost.[VAR 0114(0006)]
22	It might just be a theory, but you are one\nawesome Trainer, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0005)]
23	And Necrozma, in its own way, is an\nawesome Pokémon! Hee![VAR 0114(0006)]
24	I heard about it from Colress, yeah...\c\nHe told me you can give Solgaleo’s light\nto Necrozma![VAR 0114(0005)]
25	I heard about it from Colress, yeah...\c\nHe told me you can give Lunala’s light\nto Necrozma![VAR 0114(0005)]
26	Yes, and then Necrozma can change back into\nthat brilliant form![VAR 0114(0006)]
27	I’ve heard old stories about how Necrozma was\ndriven back by the light, but maybe people were\r\njust giving it the light it needed.[VAR 0114(0005)]
28	Someday I hope I can use a Z-Move with a\nPokémon, too...[VAR 0114(0006)]
29	All right! Thanks to my assistant Lillie, yeah,\nand the Champion h[VAR 1100(0000,0202)]imerself, [VAR 0100(0000)],\r\noh yeah, I was finally able to unlock one piece\r\nof the Z-Move puzzle, woo![VAR 0114(0005)]
30	But the mechanism of exactly how Z-Moves\nwork remains shrouded in mystery, yeah...\c\nI’m still counting on both of you to help me\nfigure it all out![VAR 0114(0005)]

0	Hello, Trainer. You finished the trial!\c\nI wouldn’t ask anybody else but you...\nWould you take care of my job for a while?
1	Hello, Trainer who finished the trial!\c\nIf you don’t mind, would you take care of my job\nagain for a while?
2	Sure
3	Not now
4	Oh, that’s OK.\nI’m not in a hurry.
5	Thank you!\nI just want to go home to eat. I’ll be back soon!

10	I’m counting on you.\c\nWhen Ilima gives you a sign, please open\nthe barricade!
11	Congratulations!\nYou’ve cleared my trial![VAR 0114(000C)]
12	Great!
13	Then...\nCaptain magic![VAR 0114(000C)]
14	Would you like to open the barricade?
15	Yes! I finally made it!\nI cleared the trial at last!\c\nI’m so glad that I didn’t give up and kept trying!\nI’ll keep working hard!
16	Wha—? Won’t you open the barricade for me?
17	You hastily opened the captain’s barricade and\nlet the Trainer pass.
18	I’m back!
19	Thank you very much!\c\nYou seem to have taken care of things for me\nwhile I was away!\c\nThis is a present for volunteering.
20	Thank you very much for volunteering!\nPlease volunteer again for other trial-goers!
21	What a shame...[VAR 0114(000C)]
22	*sniffle*\nI’ll try again.
23	No captain magic...[VAR 0114(000C)]
24	I couldn’t clear the trial, so you don’t have to\nopen the barricade... *sniffle*
25	You hastily closed the captain’s barricade, and\nthe Trainer left...
26	The Totem Pokémon is too strong.\c\nDid you defeat it?\nWow. That’s incredible.\c\n...I’ll try again.\c\nJust knowing that the Totem Pokémon can be\ndefeated gave me courage.
27	That was actually quite close.[VAR 0114(000C)]
28	Argh!\nThat was so close!
29	No captain magic...[VAR 0114(000C)]
30	Huh? Why did you open the barricade?\nDon’t make a mistake!
31	You hastily closed the captain’s barricade, and\nthe Trainer left...
32	Guess what! I reduced the Totem Pokémon’s HP\nuntil it almost fainted.\c\nThen it called for help! Can you believe it?\nI was way ahead, but in the end, I lost!
33	Oh dear. Please don’t cry so much.[VAR 0114(000C)]
34	Aaaah...\nI’m done...\c\nI’m uzelezz...\c\nI want to dizappear zomewhere...

37	You hastily closed the captain’s barricade, and\nthe Trainer left...
38	*snuffle*\c\nWas I weak and cute?\c\nDo you think Ilima felt like he wanted to\nprotect me?
39	I think you may benefit from a bit more studying.[VAR 0114(000C)]
40	Tsk...\nAll right.
41	No captain magic...[VAR 0114(000C)]
42	Huh? Did you open the barricade by mistake?\nWhat if I went through the gate?
43	You hastily closed the captain’s barricade, and\nthe Trainer left...
44	I really want to pass the trial with\nGhost Pokémon!\c\nBut Ghost-type moves won’t hit the\nPokémon there.
45	Please come back when you turn 11![VAR 0114(000C)]
46	Why?! I want to try!\nI want to try the island challenge!
47	I’m sorry, but...\nNo captain magic![VAR 0114(000C)]
48	I haven’t done the trial, so I don’t think\nI can pass through this barricade.
49	You hastily closed the captain’s barricade, and\nthe Trainer left...
50	Hehe... No matter how many times I’m turned\ndown, I’ll keep coming back.\c\nAnd I’ll keep taking a peek at the Totem\nPokémon, and when I turn 11, I’ll clear the trial\r\nat my first go!
51	Congratulations!\nYou did a great job.[VAR 0114(000C)]
52	Whoopee!\nThank you very much!
53	Now.\nCaptain magic![VAR 0114(000C)]
54	What?! Please open the barricade!\nDidn’t you see? I cleared the trial!
55	You hastily opened the captain’s barricade and\nlet the Trainer pass.
56	I’m so cool.\nI cleared the trial nicely!\c\nI may be a genius!\c\nWhat shall I do if I become the strongest\nTrainer in the Alola region?
57	You cleared the trial.\nWell done.[VAR 0114(000C)]
58	It was tough, but it was fun!
59	Captain magic![VAR 0114(000C)]
60	Hey! Don’t space out.\nOpen the barricade already.
61	You hastily opened the captain’s barricade and\nlet the Trainer pass.
62	I wish you could see my battle.\c\nI’m going to challenge Kahuna Hala right away.\nDo you want to come and cheer for me?\c\nKidding...
63	Greetings.\nCaptain Ilima here.\c\nIt seems not many trial-goers are attempting\nmy trial today.\c\nI came up with a new way of using an\nEscape Rope. If you’re bored, I can show you.\c\n... ... ...\n... ... ...[VAR 0114(000C)]

11	Please, please catch that beautifully bemaned\nPokémon for me, and show me your Pokédex!
12	I’ll reward you, of course!\nSo please do me a favor here!
13	Ahhh... I just can’t wait to meet it!\nPlease show me those luscious locks!
14	Th-that’s...Jynx!\c\nYes, it surely does have luscious locks, but\nthat’s not the Pokémon I was looking for!\r\nThe rumors were about bouncy, curly waves!
15	No way?! You caught it!\nYou caught that masterfully maned Pokémon!
16	Oh! Please!\nPlease show me at once!
17	Oh! Look at what fantástico condition its hair\nis in! Not a single split end in sight?!\c\nI never imagined such a thing...\nA Dugtrio with hair!\c\nHuh? What do you mean it’s not hair?\nYou’re telling me it’s...whiskers?!\c\nAnd it’s called a regional variant?\nSo this is a special form unique to Alola! ¡Caray!
18	Well, I am muy contento now!\nI’m totally full of thanks for you!
19	I’ll give you one of my precious treasures to\nthank you for your hard work!\r\n¡Muchas gracias!
20	Now I’m off to get one of those fancy follicled\nfriends for myself!
21	I hope you’ll come check it out when I do!\nAlola!
22	Oh... Well, that is a real letdown, but please help\nme out if you ever find the time!
644
0	Oh? Oh, hey, hey, hey!\nYou’re that trial-goer!
1	I managed to meet a marvelously maned mate\nof my own after our last meeting!\c\nAnd it’s all thanks to you, so thank you!
2	But, you know, if I were being completely honest,\nI do have one other teeny tiny problem...
3	My bemaned beauty just doesn’t seem to be\nvery affectionate toward me.\c\nI’ve tried giving it Poké Beans and petting it\nplenty, but what am I doing wrong?
4	Dugtrio seems to be staring at your hair...
5	... ... ...\n... ... ...
6	Deh...
7	¡Mira! You see that?\nIt’s gone all stroppy, and I don’t know why!
8	I wonder why that would be...\nCould it be something about your looks, maybe?
9	Now that I think about it...\c\nThere are these rare occasions when my\nluscious-locked lovely acts really\r\naffectionate toward certain customers...
10	Dug! Dug dug dug!
11	Dugtrio is wriggling furiously for some reason!
12	Dug-dug-dug-dug-dug!!!
13	Dugtrio just won’t stop!
14	Calm down, Dugtrio!
15	Is it OK?!
16	What got into it all of a sudden?!
17	Oh! B-but...could it really be?\c\nYes, that has to be it!\nMy precious pretty has got to be...
18	It’s undeniable! My baby is helplessly attracted\nto beautiful honey blond hair like yours?!
19	So the reason it wasn’t very affectionate to me\nwas simply that it likes blonds!\c\nMaybe it’s time I changed my look anyway...
20	Hon...
21	I’m sorry I’ve caused you so much trouble.\nHere, take this—it’s my favorite product!
645
0	That’s it, Crabrawler!\nJust keep punching, punching, punching!
1	Cra-blub!
2	Blub?!
3	Oh no! Come on, Crabrawler...\nStill too shy too fight in front of strangers, huh...
4	Hello? That thing you have there...\nIs that... Could that be...
5	A Z-Power Ring!
6	Please! You must have a battle with me!\c\nI want Crabrawler to feel the power\nand energy in a Z-Move!
7	Once it sees your Pokémon at full power, I bet\nCrabrawler will feel ready for a brawl and finally\r\novercome its shyness and anxiety!
8	Blubub...
9	There, there...\nNow, are you ready?
10	Absolutely!
11	Give me a sec!
12	Great, you’re ready to rumble!\nThen let’s do this!
13	Oh, don’t worry, I’m very patient.\nI’m used to waiting.
14	Oh, that was wonderful!\nYou were almost shining with all the power!
15	Don’t you think so, too, Crabrawler?
16	Cra-blub!
17	Oh my! Your fighting pose looks wonderful!
18	Oh, of course... You always hated losing, didn’t\nyou, Crabrawler? You’ve seen other Pokémon\r\nshow their full power, and now you want to, too!
19	This is all thanks to you!
20	Cra-blub!
21	I know, I know...
22	This is from Crabrawler, as a sign of thanks!
23	Really, thank you so much...\nWe’re one step closer to our dream!
24	Um, um... We want to see you at your fullest\npower, holding nothing back.\c\nCome back again tomorrow, and show us \na Z-Move. Go all out!
25	Today’s punches are as quick and powerful\nas ever!

0	Hey there, the Bewear costume show is\nstarting soon! Do you want to watch, too?
1	Oh dear, that’s too bad...\nWell, maybe when you have more time!
2	Great! One more customer, coming through!\nGo on, take a seat! The show’s about to begin!
3	Hello, hello! Welcome to the Bewear\ncostume show!
4	As I’m sure you know, Bewear may look cute,\nbut they’re actually very, very dangerous!
5	So, in this show, there will be no real Bewear\nmaking an appearance! Please relax, and enjoy!
6	Now, without further delay...\nHere are our lovely Bewear!
7	Wow!\nThey look so real![VAR 0114(003E)]
8	Alola![VAR 0114(0048)]
9	Wear Bewear wear![VAR 0114(0049)]
10	Just look at them, ladies and gentlemen!\nThey’re more active than usual!
11	...Huh?
12	... ... ...\n... ... ...[VAR 0114(0030)]
13	Now, who could be in that third\nBewear costume?
14	Are you a helper Bewear?\nThe more Bewear the merrier![VAR 0114(0048)]
15	... ... ...\n... ... ...[VAR 0114(0030)]
16	The new Bewear is motionless...
17	Ooh, could it be...a real one?
18	... ... ...\n... ... ...[VAR 0114(0030)]
19	Bewear!![VAR 0114(0047)]
20	Eeeeek!\nIt’s real![VAR 0114(0049)]
21	Everyone beware the Bewear!
22	We gotta get out of here!
23	Everyone has ran off in a panic!
24	Wear, bewear, wear...?[VAR 0114(0047)]
25	Bewear has its gaze fixed on you...
26	Wear? Bewear?[VAR 0114(0047)]
27	Run
28	Wear!
29	Bewear!
30	... ... ...\n... ... ...\c\nYou can’t escape!
31	Weeeaaarrrr![VAR 0114(0047)]
32	The menace of Bewear has passed...
33	*pant pant*...\nHuh? Where did the Bewear go...?!
34	Did... Did you...?
35	Oh, thank you, brave Trainer!\nThanks to you, nobody was hurt...
36	Oh, I’m so relieved now I could cry!\nHow can I ever show my gratitude?\c\nPlease, would you kindly accept this small\ntoken of our thanks to you?
37	Still, I can’t help but wonder what the\nreal Bewear wanted...\c\nMaybe it wanted to show us how to\nproperly be a Bewear...?
648
0	N-no, I knew I couldn’t do this...
1	Are you OK?!
2	What’s wrong?
3	Huh? Oh... Well, you see, my dad gave me a\nDewpider the other day... But well, y’see...\c\nI really, really can’t stand Dewpider!
4	[~ 4]
5	[~ 5]
6	[~ 6]
7	I know this isn’t good, but...
8	De-dew...
9	Dewpider is looking dejectedly at the girl...
10	Well, ’cause! It’s exactly like my dad!
11	My dad’s always drenched in sweat, no matter\nwhere he goes or what he does...
12	And so is Dewpider! I am so done with sweat\nbeing splattered everywhere!
13	Dew-dew-dew!
14	Dewpider shook its body, and water droplets\nglistened in the light...
15	See? See?! When it shakes its head, it splashes\nsweat around, just like Dad! How am I supposed\r\nto cope with this?!
16	Have a battle with it
17	Join forces
18	What? Me and Dewpider...together...?\nNo way... That could be a great idea!
19	If we join forces and have a battle together,\nI bet it’ll help create a bond between us!
20	I’ll do my best!
21	Hey, since you’re already here, do you think you\ncould be my opponent?
22	Sure!
23	Maybe later!
24	Thanks! Well then...c’mon, Dewpider!\nLet’s do this!
25	OK! But you promise you’ll come back, right?\nI’ll be waiting!
26	Oh man... I’m about to cry... Thanks so much for\nputting up with me. I know I must have sounded\r\nreal selfish! Here, this is for you!
27	All I wanted was to be able to battle like you\nand your Pokémon did, like a great team.\c\nI wanted to become an awesome team with\nDewpider. I honestly felt that!
28	Dew-dew!
29	Dewpider... You were really beautiful while you\nwere fighting!
30	I’m just so touched!!
31	My daughter! And Dewpider! Getting along so\nwonderfully! It makes a man want to cry!\c\n*sob sob*
32	Every time the Hiker moves, water droplets\nsplatter the area.
33	But they’re definitely not tears...
34	Wh-why are you here, Dad?! Come on—we gotta\nrun, Dewpider!
35	Haaahahahahaha! No need to be embarrassed,\nmy dear daughter!
36	But if it’s a game of tag that you want, you’ll\nfind out I’m no Slowpoke! Here I come!
649
0	You can feel a pair of eyes on you...
1	Keh heh heh heh heh...
2	Mimikyu?
3	Pikachu?
4	Everything went dark!
5	*tap* ... *tap tap tap* ...\n*hshhh* ... *hshhh* ...
6	You can hear footsteps in the dark...
7	Mi! Mi!
8	Mimikyu is staring steadily your way...
9	Try picking it up
10	Try looking under its cloth
11	Miii!
12	Mimikyu nuzzled up against you...
13	Kyu!
14	Pikachu and Mimikyu are staring steadily\nyour way...
15	Keh heh heh...
16	Kyu-u-urses!
17	Kyu!
18	Mimikyu disappeared somewhere...
19	A piece of Mimikium Z, the exclusive Z-Crystal\njust for Mimikyu, is lying on the floor!
20	Oh?\nWhat’re you doing back here, [VAR 0100(0000)]?
21	Hey, is that Mimikium Z?!
22	Wow! I’ve never actually seen a piece before!
23	It’s really, really rare, you know?
24	How did you manage to get a piece?!
25	You explain what happened with Mimikyu...
26	Wow...\nYou really are some kind of Trainer, aren’t you?
27	I can’t believe Mimikyu would actually come to\nlike you that much. It’s usually so shy!\r\nI’ve never heard of it doing anything like this.
28	Yeah, I wonder why...
29	Is that right?
30	I’ve heard that some Mimikyu get down because\nTrainers say they’d rather have Pikachu...\c\nI bet our Mimikyu was probably delighted when\nyou were so kind to it.
31	You know, it’s pretty hard not to like someone\nwho accepts you for who you are.\c\nPokémon and people are alike in that regard.
32	Or that’s my thought anyway!
33	I’m glad that Mimikyu got the chance to meet\nyou, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nThank you. From me and Mimikyu both!
34	Looks like there’s nothing left to do in here.
650
0	A trial-goer, are you?\nYou must believe in your partner[VAR 1101(00FD,0100)]s then.\c\nIn that case, I’ll be waiting.\nYes, waiting for you to overcome your trial...\r\nand waiting for the rain to fall once more...
1	I am waiting for the rain...\nThe rain that will wash everything away.
2	This is a fine rain...\c\nIt will wash everything away...\nincluding our painful defeat in battle!\c\nWhat do you say? Do you think you can handle\na little skirmish against my Pokémon?
3	Sure I can
4	I’ll take a rain check
5	The pain he left behind when he disappeared...\nThat’s what this rain really is...
6	Good! My team is perfectly tailored for the rain,\nand they are about to be unleashed upon you!
7	The power I hoped to gain from the rain...\nIt looks like it didn’t work on you, did it?
8	I had this friend. This crazy, great friend.\nAnd his name was Johnny, too.\c\nHe would use the move Rain Dance all the time,\nand he could beat absolutely anyone with it.
9	But then...he fell in love.\c\nHe fell for this right spark whose Pokémon used\nSunny Day...\c\nAnd that was the last anyone ever saw of\ngood old Johnny...
10	The team I battle with now are the Pokémon\nhe left behind when he up and disappeared.\c\nAnd every time the rain falls, these poor little\nblighters remember old Johnny...
11	Rainy days are the best...\nNo one can see your tears in the rain.

0	Hello there, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nHow lucky that you would pass by.[VAR 0114(000C)]
1	You see, it seems that I, Captain Ilima, have\ngotten mixed up in a mysterious incident.\r\nI’m in quite the pickle![VAR 0114(000C)]
2	Upon returning from a family vacation, I found\nmy guard Machamp passed out on the floor.\c\nWhat’s worse, even though I had hidden it\ncarefully, deep in the back of my bookshelves...[VAR 0114(000C)]
3	My Nugget has vanished![VAR 0114(000C)]
4	Of course, I have already found some\nsuspects—these Hypno here.[VAR 0114(000C)]
5	They were loitering around my home, so I\nwent ahead and brought them in.\c\nAs a captain, it does pain me to cast doubt\non Pokémon, but...[VAR 0114(000C)]
6	Allow me to briefly introduce you.[VAR 0114(000C)]
7	This Hypno is very skilled at using Hypnosis.[VAR 0114(000C)]
8	Zzzzzzz...
9	And this one! During the time of the crime,\nit was using Nasty Plot...\r\nOr at least I think that’s what it’s saying.[VAR 0114(000C)]
10	Heh heh heh!
11	The remaining Hypno seems to be able to use\nPsychic to move objects.\c\nIt was levitating a Granbull doll not a\nmoment ago.[VAR 0114(000C)]
12	Sych!
13	Well then, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nWhich Hypno is guilty? Which move could have\r\nbeen used to steal my Nugget?[VAR 0114(000C)]
14	Hypnosis?
15	Nasty Plot?
16	Psychic?
17	The Hypno are upset about being accused!
18	You handled that well, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nI was able to deal with the\nother Hypno that were misbehaving.[VAR 0114(000C)]
19	But to think, Hypno trying to shield one\nanother from blame...[VAR 0114(000C)]
20	Captain magic![VAR 0114(000C)]
21	Captain Ilima has solved the mystery![VAR 0114(000C)]
22	Under the guidance of Nasty Plot, they used \nHypnosis to put Machamp to sleep, and then\r\nused Psychic to steal my Nugget![VAR 0114(000C)]
23	Zzzzzzz...
24	Heh heh heh!
25	Sych!
26	Indeed, the Pokédex from a distant land says\nthat the arching movement and glitter of its\r\npendulum lull its foes into a deep\r\nstate of hypnosis.[VAR 0114(000C)]
27	I imagine that a Nugget polished with so much\ncare by Captain Ilima would be perfect\r\nas a weight for a pendulum.[VAR 0114(000C)]
28	Very well! I will gladly give the Nugget to you,\nso long as you promise to share![VAR 0114(000C)]
29	Zzzzzzz...
30	Heh heh heh!
31	Sych!
32	Now, remember! This time I’m giving it to you\nas a gift, but don’t make this a habit!\c\nStealing other people’s possessions makes\nyou a thief![VAR 0114(000C)]
33	The case is solved, thanks to you!\nPlease, as a token of my gratitude, take this\r\nBig Nugget I have also polished with care![VAR 0114(000C)]
34	Now, let us head home![VAR 0114(000C)]
35	Uhh, I still have no idea what that was all about!\nI...I feel as if I’ve been dreaming, or having\r\na nightmare!
653
0	These are the Berry Fields.\nBut there aren’t any Berry trees growing here.\c\nDo you want to know why?
1	I get it. Maybe later then!
2	Well, you see, we came here to the Alola region\nthinking to help spread the word about using\r\nfertilizer in the Berry Fields here, too.
3	The town where we come from, a place called\nCamphrier Town in Kalos, grows plenty of\r\nBerries in the nearby fields.\c\nAnd we use fertilizer to help grow our Berries!
4	But in the Alola region, people don’t have to do\na thing to help Berries grow!\c\nYou can sit back and let nature—and Pokémon—\ndo all the work, and you’ll have more Berries\r\nthan you’ll know what to do with!\c\nAnd that’s why we stopped bothering with\ntrying to farm in the fields here.
5	In fact, now we’re the ones who are enamored\nwith Alolan Berry culture!\c\nMy new dream is to try to become a true\nBerry master here in Alola!
6	The Pokémon and the rich nature provide all\nthe Berries we could ever need.\c\nMaybe I should start trying to grow some\ntasty veggies in this field here instead! ♪
654
0	Are you curious about why there is a huge\nranch instead of a big city right slap in the\r\nmiddle of Akala Island?
1	Oh.\nSorry I asked.
2	This area, which is called Paniola, is a very\nold place in the history of pioneer Alola.
3	When our ancestors drifted to the islands in\nAlola and decided to live here, the land\r\nwas not habitable.
4	So our ancestors developed the land with\ntheir Tauros just as they did before they\r\ncame to Alola.
5	They kept the most fertile land as a ranch, so\nthey wouldn’t forget their gratitude for Tauros.
6	The history of pioneering in Alola...\c\nSince the very beginning, humans have lived\nwith Pokémon.
655
0	Ah!\nWe built such a wonderful Pokémon League!\c\nI’m one of the builders of this Pokémon League.\nIs it OK to tell you a story rather passionately?
1	...Sorry, you’re about to challenge very crucial\nbattles... You must be very nervous.
2	When it was decided to build the Pokémon\nLeague, we trembled with excitement\r\nas we were going to build a big stage for battle\r\nin the Alola region for the first time!
3	And...we also trembled in awe as we were going\nto develop the sacred Mount Lanakila.
4	Professor Kukui said that building the league on\nthe sacred ground would show respect to the\r\ntapu because we will dedicate our battles\r\nto the tapu.
5	The professor also said that the building\nshouldn’t spoil the scenery of Mount Lanakila\c\nand asked us to build a Pokémon League that\nrespects tradition and history but, at the same\c\ntime, that has the feel of the future—a league\nthat can be built only in Alola.\c\nThat is how this amazing Pokémon League\nwas built.
6	I’m very honored that I was able to be involved\nin the construction of the Pokémon League!
656
0	You met the chief, didn’t you?\c\nHe likes it here and decided to live here for\na while. Do you want to know why?
1	Hohoho. Then I’ll keep his story secret.
2	We seafolk have traveled the seas around the\nworld with our houseboats.\c\nBut the chief had lived on the land just once.
3	He met a girl in a port town.\nShe was physically very weak.\c\nSo he would collect rare things all over the\nworld and show them to her.
4	One year before her passing...\c\nhe got off his boat, built a hut near her house,\nand lived there.
5	The house she lived in was a cute white house\nright under a big tree. A tree that looked just\r\nlike the one you can see over there.
6	He must pine for her whenever he sees that\ntree. That’s what I think...
7	Well, thank you for listening to this old\nwoman’s mumbling...
8	I’m old now. It may not be a bad idea to give up\nthe boat life and settle down in Poni Island.
657
0	Waaaaagh!
1	Eesh! That was some loud holler...\nI wonder what’s going on?
2	Did somethin’ happen?
3	Uh-oh... Headmaster’s gonna be so angry...
4	What’s wrong?
5	Headmaster?
6	I tripped, and I scattered Stardust all over the\nroom... Just when I had finished cleaning, too!\c\n...Oh, Headmaster is what we call our Oranguru.
7	I gotta clean up all the Stardust! But there’s\nso much, I don’t know if I can do it by myself...
8	I’ll help
9	Good luck!
10	Yeah, I’ll do my best! But if I can’t finish it on\nmy own, you’ll help me, right?
11	There is Stardust everywhere!
12	Thanks! Let me know when you find any\nStardust. I’ll clean it up!
13	The toys are covered in Stardust!
14	Wow, so much dust...\nGotta make it spick-and-span again!
15	*rummage rummage* *brush brush*\n*dig dig* *sweep sweep*
16	Hey, I did it! It’s all clean again!
17	All right, I’m gonna keep this up and make\neverything all sparkly and clean!
18	Stardust is all over the floor...
19	Oh no, there, too?! Dust goes in the dustbin!
20	*sweep sweep* *brush brush*\n*wipe wipe* *gather gather*
21	There is Stardust in the gap between the wall\nand the shelf!
22	Hey, you’re right! I’m gonna need to dig that out.
23	The window is covered in Stardust! It needs\na good polish!
24	Eek, the window’s a mess! I gotta put my back\ninto it and wipe it off...
25	*wipe wipe* *polish polish*\n*rub rub* *squeak squeak*
26	Hmmm... I think that’s it! The room is sparkling\nclean! And the headmaster didn’t catch\r\nme, either! Thanks for helping me out!
27	Foryu...
28	Hey, the headmaster had been saving that!\nYou’re so lucky! But why’d he give it to you?
29	...Goof.
30	Hey, I’m still cleaning!
658
0	Aah...\nI don’t know what to do...
1	What’s wrong?
2	Starmie?
3	This Mysterious Pokémon, Starmie...\nIt’s my buddy, but...
4	it really loves staring contests...
5	It’s been doing staring contests for a week.
6	I want to go home, but it won’t move an inch\nunless it loses...
7	Slow...
8	Shashasha!
9	Enough of your cry of triumph.\nLet’s go home, shall we?
10	Shasha!
11	Aaah... Seriously?\nYou still want to do staring contests?
12	Is there a Pokémon that can beat my Starmie...?
13	If there were a Pokémon that knew Tickle,\nit would be able to beat my Starmie instantly,\r\nbut that’s not...
14	Whoa! You...\nThat Pokémon!
15	Oh, wow! It knows the move Tickle, which\nlowers Attack and Defense stats by one level\r\nif it’s used in a battle!
16	Please please do a staring contest with my\nStarmie right now!
17	Sha, shashasha!
18	[VAR 0102(0000)] used Tickle!
19	Mie...mie! Mihaha.
20	It’s super effective!
21	Wow... Starmie, the champ of staring contests,\nis being overwhelmed!
22	...Sha shahaaaaa!
23	Starmie burst into laughter!\nIt lost!
24	Now you’ve lost. Let’s go home.
25	Thank you very much.
26	This is a token of my appreciation.\nIt think it will be useful for your journey.
27	Finally I can go home.\nBye!
28	Shasha! Shasha!
29	Is the Mysterious Pokémon, Starmie, still trying\nto do a staring contest...?

0	Hey, I’m your friend Fred!\c\nI know every Trainer in the whole world,\nand I’m friends with every one of them.\c\nJust one look at a Pokémon you got in a trade\nfrom someone else, and I can tell you everything\r\nthere is to know about its original Trainer.
1	Do you want to show him a Pokémon that you\ngot in a trade?
2	I sure do
3	Not right now
4	That’s not a Pokémon that you got from another\nTrainer, friend.
5	Come and show me what you got when you’ve\nactually traded Pokémon with someone else.
6	Eggs aren’t really Pokémon, so I can’t tell you\nanything about one of them.
7	Let’s see... This [VAR 0101(0000)]’s OT is...\c\nAh! So [VAR 0100(0001)] was its original Trainer!\nOf course! I know [VAR 0100(0001)] well!
8	[VAR 0100(0001)] is so kind, so nice...\c\nWhy, one time when I was lost in a cave, it was\n[VAR 0100(0001)] who led me to the exit and\r\nsaved me!\c\nI’ll never forget the warmth of that hand,\ntugging on mine!
9	[VAR 0100(0001)] is a really handy Trainer!\c\nI busted my Ride Pager the other day, and I was\nin a real fix, when suddenly [VAR 0100(0001)]\r\nappeared and fixed it in a flash!\c\nThose screwdrivers were moving so fast it was\nnearly blinding!
10	[VAR 0100(0001)] is a real tough nut.\c\nI saw this Hiker fall from a cliff the other day,\nand what did [VAR 0100(0001)] do?\r\nSpread both arms out wide and caught the guy!\c\nEven that Hiker was moved to tears by how\nstrong and tough [VAR 0100(0001)] was!
11	Did you know that [VAR 0100(0001)] has a real\nunusual sort of a palate for food?\c\nI’ve seen [VAR 0100(0001)] gobbling down Poké\nBeans right alongside Pokémon!\r\nAnd picking out just the Rainbow Beans, too!\c\nThat [VAR 0100(0001)] has some real\ngourmet tastes!
12	[VAR 0100(0001)] is one speedy Trainer,\nyes, [VAR 1100(00FF,0503)]sirma'am!\c\nIn the time it took me to drink down just a single\nbottle of Moomoo Milk at the Pokémon Center\r\nthe other day, that [VAR 0100(0001)] visited the\r\nmain desk, healed up a whole team of Pokémon,\r\nchecked out the PC, bought some Great Balls,\r\nsold a Nugget or two, and then gulped down a\r\nsteaming hot Tapu Cocoa in one go before\r\ndisappearing again as quick as you please!
13	That [VAR 0100(0001)] sure has a fine voice for\na Trainer, wouldn’t you say?\c\nI happened to be standing nearby when\n[VAR 0100(0001)] was having a battle, see?\c\nAnd that voice—that beautiful voice—was so\ncaptivating that not just the Pokémon on both\r\nsides but even the opposing Trainer was\r\ncompletely entranced by it, and the battle went\r\nnowhere at all!
14	That [VAR 0100(0001)] is a Trainer you can\ncount on, that’s for sure!\c\nI wasn’t paying attention the other day and got\nmyself surrounded by a pack of 10 Rockruff.\r\nBoy, I thought I was done for!\c\nThen who should appear but [VAR 0100(0001)]!\nThat [VAR 0100(0001)] could tell exactly which\r\nRockruff was the leader of the pack, caught it,\r\nand then went on to catch every other last\r\nRockruff till I was saved!
15	[VAR 0100(0001)] has got real style—that is\nsimply undeniable!\c\nI got to see [VAR 0100(0001)]’s Trainer Passport\nthe other day, and that head shot! Oh!\c\nThe angle, the outfit—it was all so perfectly put\ntogether, I wanted to ask for a copy myself!
16	[VAR 0100(0001)] is one serious person!\c\nI was riding around on Tauros the other day,\ndashing like there was no tomorrow, when I\r\nmust’ve dropped my wallet along the way.\c\nBut that [VAR 0100(0001)] picked it up and came\nafter me, miles and miles after me, to return it.
17	[VAR 0100(0001)] really smells fantastic, don’t\nyou think?\c\nEvery Pokémon and Trainer you see walk past\n[VAR 0100(0001)] can’t seem to help turning\r\nback for one last whiff of that sweet scent!
18	I hope you’ll keep taking good care of that there\n[VAR 0101(0000)], and be sure to think of\r\n[VAR 0100(0001)] when you do!
665

3	Rumors?

16	You’ve got yourself a deal.\nCome back tomorrow if you want more.
17	Well, well, well...\c\nSorry, I’m not the type to give discounts.\nCome back tomorrow with more dough.
18	Well, well, well...\nAll you wanted from me was a battle, eh?

4	Oh...? That’s the first time I’ve seen it go up to\nsomeone on its own like that...\c\nMaybe it senses something special about you.
5	Vulpix seems to calm down when you’re around,\ntoo. Do you think you could come and visit us\r\nfrom time to time?
6	Oh... No, it’s OK. I shouldn’t get you tangled up\nin this, anyway...

8	Kyuuu...
9	Vulpix is shaking slightly...
10	Do you think you could come back and visit\nVulpix tomorrow...or whenever you have time?
11	Oh, you’re here! It’s great to have your help.
12	It’s started eating the food we’ve prepared!\nI think it’s beginning to trust me, too, thanks\r\nto you!
13	Oh, I know! How about we all share a Big \nMalasada together? I think Vulpix trusts you\r\nenough that you could get it to try a malasada!
14	Oh, but you don’t have a Big Malasada...\nYou can get them at the malasada shop.\c\nDo you think you could pick one up?

0	The Three Little Trial-Goers\n\nIt’s a game book where you get to take part!\nAs you read, make your own choices to shape\nthe story and the adventure as you like!
1	Would you like to give the book a read?
2	One day, Pikachu, Pyukumuku, and Slowpoke\nwere busily readying their things to set out on\ntheir island challenge.\n“Hey, hey! What do you guys think we should\nbring with us when we set out?”
3	What should they bring with them?
4	Food
5	Money
6	Quit reading
7	So Pikachu spent the entire day preparing\nfood enough for everyone. There were yummy\nsandwiches, cookies, and of course a generous\nhelping of Berries! Finally, the only thing left to\ndo was to pack them all safely in a basket.
8	After finding a good basket, Pikachu headed\nback to the kitchen to start packing up all the\nfood to go...only to discover that the food had\ndisappeared somewhere!
9	Where could that carefully prepared feast have\ndisappeared to? Who should be questioned?
10	Pyukumuku
11	Slowpoke
12	“Um, Pyukumuku, do you know where all\nthe food I made went to?”\n“Oh! I’m sorry,” Pyukumuku mumbled. “Some\nof the other Pyukumuku smelled all the good\nfood, and a few—or 10—of them stopped by...”
13	“They were all around me, drool dripping from\ntheir mouths, and I just couldn’t stand it! So I let\nthem eat it.”\n“You did?! I mean, I’m glad if they liked it, but\nnow I’ve got to make everything again...”
14	Oh boy...\nAnd so, once again, the trio failed to set out\non their island challenge this day. Perhaps their\ntime will come someday!\n                                          THE END
15	“Um, Slowpoke, do you know where all\nthe food I made went to?”\nSlowpoke grinned and said, “Sure do! And it\nwas delicious, by the way. Boy, I’d say it was as\ngood as a Slowpoke’s own tail!”
16	“Well, thank you for the compliment! But now\nI’ll have to make food for our island challenge\nall over again,” Pikachu said, with a small sigh\nof frustration.
17	And so all three of the Pokémon brought out\ntheir savings and pooled their money for\ntheir journey.\nJust then, there was a knock at the door.\n“Oh! We must have a visitor!”
18	Who should go to answer the door?
19	Pikachu
20	Pikachu went to check the front door. When\nhe came back, Slowpoke asked, “So who was it\nat the door?”
21	Pikachu shifted uneasily from foot to foot,\nlooking sheepish.\n“It was a traveling salesman. I’m sorry, but I...\nI spent all of our money!” he explained in a rush.
22	“The salesman said that this was the last\npiece of Pikanium Z he had in stock, and...and\nI’m always using that old Electrium Z I have, so\nI really, really wanted it!”\n“You spoiled little stinker!”
23	With all of their savings spent, the trio had to\nput aside their plans for an island challenge\nand focus instead on finding part-time work.
24	Pyukumuku pulled the door open, asking,\n“Yes? Who is it?”\n“I heard you three were thinking to go on an\nisland challenge, so I came to give you a bit of\nadvice!” It was Delibird standing at the door.
25	Pyukumuku was delighted. “Mr. Delibird!\nWe would absolutely love your advice!”\n“Lovely! It will only cost you a mere $200!”
26	Should Pyukumuku pay Delibird the $200?
27	Pay
28	Don’t pay
29	Pyukumuku handed over the $200.\n“Then here is my advice for you! If you have\n$200 to spare, use it to buy yourself a Potion!\nBuy a whole ton of Potions, in fact. Journeys can\nbe a dangerous thing.”
30	And Delibird gave Pyukumuku three Potions\nfrom his own stock.\n“Here is a special present to you for listening\nto my advice!”\nPyukumuku was delighted with the gift.
31	With a good stock of items to keep them well,\nthe trio was finally ready to set out on their\nisland challenge. Their preparations were a\ngreat success!
32	When you are out on your island challenge,\ngentle reader, perhaps you will see this plucky\ntrio somewhere and smile!\n                                          THE END
33	Pyukumuku turned down Delibird’s offer for\nadvice, saying, “Oh, that’s all right... I reckon\nwe can think things through and get ready all\non our own.”
34	The trio talked together about what they\nthought they would need for their journey.\n“We’re still pretty little, so I bet we’ll get real\nsleepy when night comes around. Maybe we\nshould get an Awakening to keep us alert?”
35	“Then let’s go shopping!”\nAnd the trio set out at once to go to the shop.\n“Um, please give us as many Awakenings as\nwe can buy with this!” they called out to the\nshop clerk.
36	When they left the shop, though, Pyukumuku\nwas staggering beneath the weight of so many\nAwakenings—and she tripped and fell!\n“Ow! Ow-ow-owww!”\nShe was badly hurt!
37	“We don’t have anything to help with injuries!\nWe should have bought Potions instead...”\nWith little other choice available to them, the\ntrio returned home for the day.
38	Slowpoke opened the door, and standing on\nthe other side was a very hungry Munchlax.\n“I’m starving! Don’t you have anything to eat?”\nMunchlax asked.
39	Slowpoke replied, “We were planning to buy\nfood on the road, so we don’t have anything\nat the moment.”\nWhen he heard this, Munchlax took a step\ninside, moving closer to Slowpoke...
40	“You know...you smell pretty tasty, Slowpoke.\nThat tail of yours—and really all of you—looks\nso glossy and juicy and...”\nMunchlax swallowed, licking his lips as he\ntook another step closer.
41	“Gahhh! Don’t eat me! J-just keep away from\nme, and I’ll get you some pizza or something!”\nAnd so Slowpoke hurried off in a rush to order\na whole pile of pizzas to treat Munchlax.
42	Although it hadn’t been in the plans, they all\nhad a good time with their impromptu pizza\nparty as Munchlax and the trio used up every\nlast bit of savings they had.

1	I’m interested!

10	Thanks!
11	That’s great!
12	Kyuuuuuuuuumf!
13	Oh! Come on, Comfey! Just because your Ability\nis Triage doesn’t mean you can go ahead and\r\nheal other people’s Pokémon! That’s my job!
14	Kyumf...
15	The Ability Triage gives priority to your\nPokémon’s healing moves!
16	Comfey is so caring, it uses Floral Healing the\nmoment any Pokémon are near, just in case!

0	There is one more hotel on Akala Island, [VAR 1100(00FF,0403)]sirmiss.\c\nI leave it up to your exquisite tastes to judge\nwhich of the two offers the most delight.\c\nMe? I prefer the Tide Song Hotel. I interviewed\nfor a job at that other place and got rejected.
1	Sigh...
2	Ask what’s wrong
3	Leave him be
4	Are you worried about me?\nThat’s very sweet of you.\c\nYou see the truth is...well...\c\nI know I said I like the Tide Song best, but I still\ncan’t seem to let go of my dream of working at\r\nthe Hano Grand Resort.
5	It is, of course, delightful to work here at the\nTide Song, and I know I’m lucky to be here.\c\nYet I can’t help also wanting to experience\nworking someplace a bit more glamorous...\c\nBut I’d feel like I let down the owner of the Tide\nSong if I left now to apply to the Hano again.
6	Greetings, and welcome to the Tide Song Hotel.\c\nIs there something the matter, [VAR 1100(00FF,0403)]sirmiss?\nAnything that I might assist you with?
7	And so you told the owner of the Tide Song\nabout the Bellhop’s worries.
8	Hah! Is that so?\nI had no idea he had so much on his mind.
9	Traveling Trainer, if I might ask of you a favor?\c\nIf you happen to have a Magmar among your\nPokémon, would you be so kind as to show it to\r\nmy troubled employee?
10	Will you show the Bellhop your Magmar?
11	You called Magmar from its Poké Ball in front\nof the Bellhop.
12	Wha—! That was a Magmar!\nBut why would you...
13	Oh, never mind that!\nListen! You’ve reminded me of something!
14	When I first set my heart on becoming a Bellhop,\nit was my mother who cheered me on.\c\nYes, my dear old mother...who looks just like\nthat Magmar there.
15	“When you become a Bellhop, you will be the\nface of the hotel—the very first person that\r\nguests see when they arrive at the hotel!\c\n“Be sure that you do it right!”
16	That’s what she told me.
17	I am so sorry that I let a valued guest like\nyourself overhear me sighing like that!\c\nI am going to do my utmost to be the best\nBellhop I can be, right here at the Tide Song!
18	That is a token of my thanks to you!
19	Thank you very much.\c\nI will see that he works his hardest and hones\nhis skills until you’ll hardly even recognize him!
20	I’d meant for him to remember how he felt when\nhe first started out, and to try again for that job\r\nat the Hano Grand Resort if he wanted, but...\c\nI must admit that I’m grateful to see he is so\nmotivated to do his best here with us.
21	Good day, and welcome to the Tide Song Hotel.\nPlease enjoy your stay.

19	Hey, did you know? This place is inspired\ndirectly by the Kanto region, the main scene\r\nof Pokémon Gyms!
20	I hear it’s a perfect re-creation of a famous Gym\nin Vermilion City! Those Kanto folks sure know\r\nhow to show people a good time!
21	Aaah... So this is what a Pokémon Gym is like.\nI haven’t had this much fun in years!

23	Welcome, Trainer! I’m Adrian, one of the\nGym Trainers here!
24	I hope you enjoyed yourself!

27	Oh, congratulations! Would you like to order\nanother drink?
28	I hear this Gym is just full of the owner’s fond\nmemories of the Kanto region.

0	Hey, hey! Do you know?\c\nRecently, ghosts have been appearing in the\nTrainers’ School.
1	Everybody got scared, and nobody will even go\nnear the school at night.
2	I hope someone—like a Pokémon Trainer who is\nstrong enough to be acknowledged by the\r\nisland kahuna—will solve the mysteries!
3	Hey, hey! It’s big news!\c\nThe seven mysteries at the Trainers’ School\nall turned out to be misunderstandings!

8	Wha—? You’re the one who solved the\nseven mysteries?!
9	So cool! That’s what you’d expect from a skilled\nTrainer who was acknowledged by the kahuna!
10	I’ll give you my treasure to thank you for\nsolving the mysteries!
11	But people still talk about the seventh\nghost story. It’s a mystery.\c\nAbout the student who was taken away by\na Drifloon...
12	I’ve heard that there is a journal from those\ndays somewhere in the Trainers’ School.

50	Kyukyuuu!
51	The girl and Drifloon look happy...
52	Hey! You over there!\nWhat are you doing this late at night?
53	He seems to be the school’s security officer.
54	The girl and Drifloon disappeared...
55	What’s wrong?
56	The girl...
57	Drifloon...
58	Hahaha. Seven mysteries, right?\nEverybody talks about them.\c\nBut you were alone.

5	Wha—? Am I one of the seven mysteries?\nAre you kidding?! No way!
6	I just... I just wanted to burn some letters...\nI was just burning them secretly.\c\nDid the flames make people think that it\nwas some kind of spirit or something?
7	I wrote love letters for the person I like and\nwanted to give them to him.
8	But he already...\nSo...
9	So you burned them?
10	Are you really OK with that?
11	You don’t understand how I feel!\c\nTake this! The heartbroken power of a girl\nwith a fragile heart!

21	This is my buddy, Grimo.\c\nHe seems to be interested in beating his\nrival, Grimey.
22	Ggggrimmmeer.
23	Normally, I leave all the cleaning to this hard\nworker, Grimo, but today we have to clean\r\nthe lockers as well, so...
24	See. With these cute hands, he can’t open\nlockers, right?
25	It seems the cause of the rumor was the\nGrimer Grimo.
26	Grimo loves cleaning, so he eats\nabsolutely everything.\c\nIf you’re in the way when he’s trying to clean up\nan area, you might even get...well...\c\nJust kidding! He probably wouldn’t swallow you!

0	There is a bottle on the ground with a relatively\nnew-looking letter inside of it...\c\nWill you open the bottle?
1	To whoever is reading this letter,\n\nI would be very grateful if you could deliver this\nletter to Nainoa, a Trainer on Ula’ula Island of\nAlola. He should be at Malie City’s cape.
2	And if you could challenge him to a Pokémon\nbattle, you would be doing me a favor. I would\ngo myself, but I figured you could get him\nwarmed up for me! ...Just kidding, of course.
3	Huh? Who are you? You need something?
4	You tell him about the letter you found on\nUla’ula Beach...
5	Th-this...this is a letter from Arabella!\c\nHe’s challenging me to a battle?!
6	I know you only found the letter and don’t have\nanything to do with this whole thing, but please!\c\nYou have to battle me!
7	Well, OK, but you have to battle me when you’re\nready! You have to!
8	Great, I’m glad you understand! All right, let’s\ndo this!
9	Arabella took me under his wing when I was\nback in Kanto... He’s a Trainer at a famous Gym\r\nin that region, and I always looked up to him...\c\nBut recently I’ve been in a slump, and it became\nharder and harder for me to write him...
10	So I guess he wanted to reach out to me, even if\nit meant throwing a bottle into the ocean...\c\nIt’s so silly, right? The letter could have just\nbeen lost, and I’d never know...
11	Sorry you had to get mixed up in this, but I gotta\nadmit, I’m glad I was able to battle you!\c\nHere, take this! You deserve something for\nyour trouble!
12	Maybe it’s not too late for me to do an island\nchallenge... Y’know, to become a Trainer like\r\nArabella. Then I could visit him in Kanto and\r\nshow him how strong I’ve gotten!
13	Do you want to read the letter in the bottle\none more time?

0	I wonder if we’ll get to meet again tonight...\nOh, I can’t wait until the sun goes down!
1	Alola! It’s such a beautiful night, isn’t it?\nWould you like to see something fantastic?
2	Sure, I’m not here to force anybody.
3	Then come this way...\nIt’s better if you crouch down, too.
4	...See that?
5	What do you think that is?
6	The correct answer is that it’s the light of the\nWing Fish Pokémon, Finneon!
7	They store up light from the sun during the day,\nthen let their tail fin patterns all glow at night!
8	If you want to see them again ever, feel free\nto stop by. I can make any night a special night.
9	Are you here because you wanted to see the\nlight of the Finneon again?
10	They just glow like this, night after night,\nwhether anyone is here to see it or not.
11	Seeing that pure dedication makes me feel like\nmaybe I should try a little harder, too.
695
0	Hi, [VAR 0100(0000)].\nWhat a coincidence![VAR 0114(001C)]
1	The Machamp I call upon as a Ride Pokémon\nreally loves training, so we sometimes come\r\nhere together.[VAR 0114(001C)]
2	Yah![VAR 0114(0045)]
3	Great! That is the right amount of load for\nthe muscle![VAR 0114(001C)]
4	Mmmmmm!![VAR 0114(0045)]
5	Lifting a heavy object!\nThat is, the change in potential energy!\c\nThe science you can learn from the muscles\nis inspiring![VAR 0114(001C)]
6	Yeah. I should train sometimes, too.[VAR 0114(001C)]
7	Hm! Hm!\nHm! Hm![VAR 0114(001C)]
8	*sigh* Of course, Machamp is stronger\nthan me.\c\nWell, let’s call it a day.[VAR 0114(001C)]
9	The Masked Royal is really great.\nHe could lift me quite easily.[VAR 0114(001C)]
10	Yah![VAR 0114(0045)]
11	Are you satisfied?[VAR 0114(001C)]
12	All right. See you again![VAR 0114(001C)]
696
0	I really would love to see that Pokémon with\nmy own two eyes, you know...
1	You know! It’s that rare Electric type one.\nThe one that looks like three Pokémon stuck\r\ntogether. Oh, what’s its name again...?
2	It’s that one that can even poison Steel-type\nPokémon.\c\nAnd only females can evolve into it...\nOh, what’s its name again?
3	I’ve heard it’s not even a Dragon type in other\nregions! You must know the one I mean!
4	Oooh, but the name...\nIt’s on the tip of my tongue, but I can’t recall it!
5	You know the one, though, don’t you?\nI’d love it if you could show me a specimen.
6	Th-that Pokémon you have there!
7	That’s it...\nMagneton! That’s the name!
8	That’s it...\nSalazzle! That’s the name!
9	That’s it...\nExeggutor! That’s the name!
10	This is my first time seeing one in the flesh.\nGoodness, it really is stuck together, isn’t it?
11	This is my first time seeing one in the flesh.\nGoodness, that curvaceous form is really rather\r\nartistic, wouldn’t you say?
12	This is my first time seeing one in the flesh.\nGoodness, it’s much longer than I expected!
13	Here’s a little thank-you gift!
14	It was so frustrating to not be able to remember\nthe name. But that’s all better thanks to you!\r\nI’ll remember you the next time I’m stumped!
15	I feel like my memory has really improved a lot\nthanks to your help. I appreciate it!
697
0	Your Poké Ball is shaking wildly!
1	[VAR 0101(0000)] popped out!
2	Koo!
3	Hoo!
4	Deh!
5	Mrowr!
6	Mrawrrr!
7	Rawrrr!
8	Bwark!
9	Briooo!
10	Mariii!
11	Looking back at your first partner, the first\nPokémon you ever chose in your adventure...\r\nyou are reminded of how far you have come.
698
0	Grrr...[VAR 0114(0030)]
1	This is Tigrudo, the pro wrestler Incineroar!\nHe’s been in a slump lately, though...\r\nWanna hear about it?
2	Until recently, Tigrudo here was undefeated.\nThe place was always jam-packed to the\r\nrafters for his matches!
3	But now he’s been losing to an up-and-coming\npro wrestler, Machamp. It looks like Tigrudo is\r\nstarting to lose his mojo.
4	Mraow...[VAR 0114(0046)]
5	If only he had the TM for Acrobatics, maybe\nhe’d stand a chance against the\r\nFighting-type Machamp.
6	Would you look at that? You’ve got the TM for\nAcrobatics right there, don’t you?!
7	You can use a TM as many times as you want,\nso would you use it on Tigrudo?
8	Sure
9	I’d prefer not to
10	Great, thanks!
11	Tigrudo learned Acrobatics!
12	Roooaarrr![VAR 0114(0046)]
13	All right! Looks like he’s ready to go now!
14	Here, let me give you something to\nsay thanks.
15	Time to practice until he perfects Acrobatics!\nIt’ll be a beauty!
16	Grrroooooarr![VAR 0114(0046)]
17	Chump...[VAR 0114(0030)]
18	This is Macho ’Mon, the pro wrestling Machamp!\nHe’s been going through some hard times\r\nrecently, though. Wanna hear about it?
19	Macho ’Mon was a real up-and-comer! He was a\nwrestler who was a once-in-a-century talent.
20	Lately, though, he keeps losing to the crafty\nveteran pro wrestler Incineroar.\r\nIt looks like he’s starting to lose his mojo.
21	Meh-chump...[VAR 0114(0045)]
22	If he only had a Coba Berry, he’d be able to\nhang in there when he gets hit by Acrobatics\r\nfrom Incineroar.
23	Would you look at that? You’ve got a Coba Berry\nright there, don’t you?!
24	Would you let Macho ’Mon have that\nCoba Berry?
25	That’ll be a big help!
26	You gave Macho ’Mon the Coba Berry!
27	MACHO![VAR 0114(0045)]
28	All right! Incineroar’s Acrobatics are no big\ndeal anymore!
29	Time to learn his spots so he can make the\nmost of that Coba Berry!
30	CHAMP![VAR 0114(0045)]
31	Tigrudo and Macho ’Mon have a great rivalry\nnow, pushing each other to the limit!
699
0	Muke...[VAR 0114(0030)]
1	The Pyukumuku is gazing sadly out over the\nocean waves.
2	Don’t you think that Pyukumuku there is feeling\na bit down in the dumps?[VAR 0114(0040)]
3	His name is Mukeo.\nAnd he’s lost his Mukiet...[VAR 0114(0040)]
4	His beloved Mukiet was flung out to sea one\nday by a part-time Pyukumuku chucker.[VAR 0114(0040)]
5	And ever since that time, he’s been just like\nyou see there... Always staring at the sea...[VAR 0114(0040)]
6	Muuuke...[VAR 0114(004B)]
7	Maybe it’s because he reminds me of myself...\nI really sympathize with how he must feel.[VAR 0114(0040)]
8	Maybe Mukiet has been washed ashore again\nsomewhere on the beach...[VAR 0114(0040)]
9	She’s easy to recognize because she always\ncries “O Mukeo, Mukeo!”\r\nIf you don’t mind...I hope you’ll help look for her.[VAR 0114(0040)]
10	O Mukeo, Mukeo![VAR 0114(0030)]
11	That cry... Could it be Mukiet?\nShould you take this one to Mukeo?
12	Mukiet!!![VAR 0114(004B)]
13	*sniffle*\nOh, I’m so glad... I’m so happy for you, Mukeo...[VAR 0114(0040)]
14	Even if there are people in this world who chuck\nPyukumuku away, there are also those who will\r\ngently lift them up, as well...[VAR 0114(0040)]
15	I’m just so moved by this whole experience.\nYou have to let me give you this.[VAR 0114(0040)]
16	Mukeo... Mukiet...\nBe happy...for me, too...[VAR 0114(0040)]
17	Woo-hoo! Pyukumuku![VAR 0114(003E)]
18	Hyah! Back to the sea with you![VAR 0114(003E)]

0	Who Wants to Be a Game Creator?\n\nIt’s an interactive adventure book!\nAs you read the book, choose what you’d like to\ndo, and create a story!
1	Would you like to read the book?
2	The time is now! I’ve finally made up my mind\nto become a game creator!\nMy heart is full of excitement and anticipation\nfor the future!
3	Right! It’s time for me to head outside and\ntake my first steps toward becoming a\ngame creator!
4	Where should I go?
5	Quit reading
6	To the ocean
7	To the mountain
8	To the town
9	The ocean is so vast! I feel as if my heart is\ngrowing, too!\nWhoa! There’s a huge splash offshore.
10	There’s a huge splash!\nWhat should I do?
11	Fish
12	Swim to get closer
13	I lifted my fishing rod and swung it down\nstraight, just like throwing a Poké Ball!\nThe lure flew beautifully. It’s a perfect cast!
14	*splash splash splash* \nIt’s huge!\nBut I still managed to haul it up. Woo-hoo!\nWhat jumped out of the water was a big\nMantine...with...a guy on its back!
15	“Ho ho! I was watching you! \nYou’re pretty good at fishing!\nNow, I have a proposition.\nWhy don’t you come with me and\nbecome the best fisher in the world?”
16	I looked the man straight in the eyes\nand answered!
17	Yes! I’ll do my best!
18	I have another dream...
19	Several years later...\nI became a full-fledged fisher!\nI keep a tight hold on my fishing rod and fish\nthroughout the vast oceans of the world!
20	This is not the dream I set out to live,\nbut I am living my life to the fullest.\nI feel happy every day!\n\n                                         THE END
21	“That’s too bad, but I hope you can make your\ndream come true.”\nHe turned around and disappeared among the\nwaves with Mantine.
22	At that moment, my eyes were glued to the\nman’s movements! Those outstretched arms,\nhis comfortably bent knees, his easy, relaxed\nstance, and his flowing, waving hair.
23	I wanted to see his movements one more time.\nBut I never saw him again...\nI began to study the movement of the human\nbody with all my might.
24	Soon I became a motion designer, someone who\nmoves characters around.\nNow I can even re-create that man’s fluid\nmovements perfectly!
25	Yay! I made my dream come true!\nI became a game creator!\nNow, I’m going to make many great games!\n\n                                         THE END
26	I swam and got closer to the splash!\nThere were three women practicing\nsynchronized swimming!
27	One of the swimmers shouts,\n“Stop! Don’t thrash your legs about so hard!\nIn synchronized swimming, every splash,\nevery drop of water, must itself be beautiful!”
28	Without thinking, I responded.
29	I had no idea!
30	I want to try it!
31	“I’ll show you a beautiful splash!”\nAs she quickly dove into the water, dancing\ndroplets scattered beautifully around.
32	The droplets sparkled, shimmering in the light. I\nwas so moved that even after I’d gone home, all\nI could think of was the beauty of the droplets.
33	I wanted to reproduce the beautiful splash\nso much that I started intensely studying light\nand the movement of water!
34	I became an effect designer, who adds effects\nto video games.\nSand clouds, explosions, magic—I can make any\nkind of effect!\nIncluding beautiful splashes, of course.
35	A few years later...\nI became a synchronized swimmer!\nIn my next competition, I’ll be competing on the\nsame team as the woman who inspired me!
36	Mountains are so huge! I feel as if my very soul\nis growing taller!\nHm? Did something shine at the top\nof the mountain just now?
37	What is that?
38	Look at it with binoculars
39	Ask the person next to you
40	I held binoculars to my eyes and looked at\nthe top of the mountain!\nThe silver glimmer was coming from\na vending machine!
41	I climbed the mountain up to the vending\nmachine and found a sad-looking girl there.\nShe said to me, “I put money in it, but it won’t\ngive me a drink!”
42	A good smack is the best way to fix a machine\nthat’s stuck.\n“Hi-yah!” I slugged the vending machine.\n*clunk*\nOut dropped a Fresh Water!
43	“Oh wow, thank you so much! I bet you could\nbecome a Black Belt!”\nThe girl’s praise makes me giddy!
44	I try to hide my blushing face as I answer her.
45	Yeah, you bet I’ll become one!
46	Now, why did it break...?
47	A few years later...\nI have become a powerful, brawny Black Belt!\nAnd that girl promised to cheer me on at the\nnext world championship!
48	Come to think of it, it was the broken vending\nmachine that made the girl sad. I don’t want to\nsee her like that ever again!
49	I thought back to when I fixed the vending\nmachine, trying to recall every detail.\nI remember it made a beeping noise when I\nhit it, and then the Fresh Water popped out.
50	What was that beeping noise? If the drink\nhad just been stuck, it would not have made\nany noise like that. I began intensely studying\nthe workings of machinery!
51	I became a programmer. I was able to create a\nreliable vending machine that never broke, and\nit made the girl happy. Next, I want to make a\ngreat game for her!
52	I asked one of the ladies sitting next to me,\n“Did you see something shine up at the top\nof the mountain?”
53	“Oh, yes, that must be, you know, that thing.\nI mean, it is evening and all—it must have been\nflying and turned, or something.”\n...Her answer made no sense at all.
54	As I stood there, mystified, the lady next to the\nfirst lady stepped in to explain.\n“An airplane must have made a turn in the air\nand reflected the light from the sunset.”
55	The second lady’s explanation was so easy\nto understand. I bet she always has to do an\ninterpretation of what the first lady says!
56	In my amazement, I realized something!
57	Words are very important!
58	Interpreting seems like fun!
59	I thanked the second lady. But then, the first\nlady butted in.\n“Oh, but that’s what I said from the very\nbeginning, isn’t it?”
60	I tried to keep my annoyance hidden as I\nanswered, “Yes, of course! I’m sorry.”\nThe first lady smiled, and then they both\nwalked away together.
61	The second lady’s words were easy to\nunderstand, but it was my words that made\nthe first lady smile in the end. I want to learn\nhow to use both styles of words!\nI began intensely studying words and language.
62	I became a scenario writer. My stories aren’t\njust fun—I always try to write lines that are\neasy to understand and make people happy!
63	A few years later...I became an interpreter! And\nthis year, I’ll even get to work as an interpreter\nfor the Pokémon World Championships!
64	The town is so lively! I feel like my spirit is\nbecoming more cheerful as I walk!\n...But where am I? I think I’ve become lost!
65	I’ve become lost! What should I do?
66	Ask at the police station
67	Wander aimlessly
68	I stepped into the police station.\n“Excuse me, could you tell me where I—”\nSuddenly, I was interrupted.\nAn old man cried, “You must help me!”
69	The old man showed me the vase in his grasp\nas he said, “Somebody stole my precious\nvase and left this fake one in its place!”
70	“Please, help me, Officer!”\nThe old man seems to have mistaken me\nfor a police officer!
71	I tried to calm him down. I began to speak.\n“No, sir, you’ve got the wrong—”\nHe exclaimed, “Of course I have the wrong one!\nYou can tell by the sound it makes, see?”\nHe flicked the vase, and it rang beautifully!
72	Caught up in the moment, I blurted out...
73	I’ll find the culprit!
74	This note is F!
75	A few years passed. After deciding to help the\nold man on a whim, I have become a police\nofficer! I help people throughout the town and\nsolve any crime that comes my way!
76	The old man looked surprised and said,\n“An F note...? Th-then this must be my real\nvase! No other vase could make such a sound!”\nI asked, “So why did you think it was a fake?”
77	“It’s been a while since I gave it a good polish.\nThat must be why it looks so faded!\nMy mistake—sorry about the hassle!”\nThe old man wandered off, holding his vase and\nhumming to himself.
78	The contentedness in the old man’s humming\nfilled me with elation.\nAnd that compelling note the vase made...\nI began to intensely study sound and its\nvarious effects.
79	I became a sound designer! Based on my\nexperience with the old man, I have composed\nmany great themes—for mysteries, for joy, and\nof course for vases and the old man!
80	*pant pant*\nAfter wandering aimlessly for some time,\nI grew tired.\nSuddenly, someone shouted at me!\n“Hey there, you’re looking pathetic!”
81	A pretentious guy on a bicycle zipped by me.\n“I’ll bet you can’t keep up with me!” he snorted.\nHis attitude made me angry!
82	I chased after the guy. He continued to taunt\nme by pedaling just beyond my reach!\nWith a sneer, he said, “Oh, come on now,\nyou’ll never catch me like that!”
83	Finally, a bit of luck! I managed to chase him\ninto an alleyway that was too narrow for a bike!\n“OK, OK! You got me! I give up!” he said.
84	Feeling proud and happy, I told him...
85	It’s thanks to this alley!
86	I’m not bad on my feet, eh?
87	The pretentious guy and I settled our\ndifferences and shook hands on it!\nBut I must have run for 10 minutes or more!
88	I began thinking about the paths I just\nran through. This town had no hills, and the\nturns were all clearly marked. It was easy to\nkeep running!
89	I had never thought about roads that made\nrunning easy! Geography and city planning are\nreally interesting! I began studying intensely\nabout paths and how they should be.
90	I became a map designer! To this day, I design\nmaps, focusing on making maps that are easy\nto navigate and fun to wander around in!
91	A few years passed.\nHaving enjoyed my taste of pedestrian victory,\nI became a marathon runner!\nThere’s no path I won’t run on!\nThe world is my racetrack!

1	If you can beat them all, then maybe I’ll show\nyou my full power, too...
2	Skilled Trainers?
3	Where are they?
4	Not interested
5	They’re the ones you can battle once you’ve\ndefeated everyone else in their area.
6	Let’s see... You haven’t beaten the Trainers at...

18	And that’s about it. Do you think you can\ndefeat them all?
19	Seems like you’ve defeated aaaaall of Alola’s\nskilled Trainers!
20	So, what do you say? Want to have a full-power\nbattle with me?
21	Well, that’s too bad. Let me know if you change\nyour mind.
22	It’s been a while since I went all out in a battle...\nThis should be fun!
23	Now, let’s begin the Pokémon battle!
24	That was a battle to make my spirit burn!\nHere’s a token of my thanks to you.
25	I enjoyed our battle from the bottom of my\nheart! I can’t remember the last time I had such\r\nan intense battle.
26	You’re definitely one of the best Trainers. I’ll\nkeep an eye on you, to see if you get better!
27	When held, the Life Orb causes the Pokémon to\nlose health each time it attacks, but in\r\nexchange its moves become more powerful.
702
0	Oh, look!\nThe Exeggutor are sunbathing!\c\nSoaking up plenty of the sun’s rays like that is\nhow their necks grow so long!
1	Ah, see that?\nThe Exeggutor are moonbathing!\c\nThey love the warmth of the sunlight so much\nthat they try to soak up any light, no matter\r\nhow weak.
2	You’re a lucky one for getting to see such a\nspecial sight!
703
0	Hey there, the rain’s really coming down!\nYou’ll catch a cold, wandering around like that!
1	Why not come over here? This is the perfect\nspot to sit out this downpour.
2	Ah, the rain of Alola! Comes and goes as it\npleases, just like the guardian deities, eh?
3	Same as you, come to think of it. Always running\noff to this island, that island...
4	I was like that back in the day, too, y’know?\nNow, I only got time for what I like to do, though.
5	Ah, but then you might like running around the\nislands! Just doing what you like, too, eh?
6	Ah...
7	Well, looks like the rain’s let up!\nI’ll head on back to my boat.
704
0	Should I risk a broken heart, or should I not and\nlive in uncertainty...?
1	What’s wrong?
2	Bye
3	Wh-wh-what’s this?! You...\nCould...could it be...?
4	That Z-Power Ring, glistening on your arm!
5	That must mean you can use Z-Moves, am\nI right?!
6	Aah... This is destiny!\nA gift from the heavens...
7	Please! You’ve gotta help me with your\nfull power!
8	Help you?
9	My full power?
10	Oh, uh, sure. Bye.
11	[~ 11]
12	That’s right! I want to see your full-powered\nZ-Moves!
13	Because, well, you see... There’s, ah, there’s\nsomeone I like...
14	I’m too afraid to confess my feelings for her!\nI don’t have the courage!
15	But I feel like if I see a Z-Move, it would inspire\nme to go all out myself...
16	[~ 16]
17	Please! You’ve got to help me find true love\nand happiness!
18	Sure!
19	Maybe later!
20	[~ 20]

22	Fantastic! Don’t hold back—show me those\nZ-Moves to your heart’s content!

25	I’m so grateful! Please, take this!\nIt’s from my collection!
26	Thanks to you, I know what it means to be at\nfull power, now!
27	Woooooo!\nI’m gonna confess my feelings!!
28	... ... ...\n... ... ...\c\nI confessed my feelings at full power, but she\nwas equally full powered in her refusal...
29	But well, it feels good to have confessed to her.\nThanks for helping me out!
30	So long as you promise you’ll be back!\nI’ll be waiting!
31	No no no! I want to see you and your\nPokémon go all out!\c\nI’m going to keep asking until you\nshow me what I want!
32	Having said that, I’m all tuckered out\nfor today! I’ll see you tomorrow!
33	Now, I must push on! To find the next\none-and-only love of my life!

1	I wanna see!
2	No way
3	Whaaat! No way!\nYou must wanna see it, right?
4	No means no, kid
5	I guess I could take a look...
6	You really don’t wanna see my sand castle?\nWell, fine then...you party pooper...
7	Then I’ll let you see it this one time!\nHee hee!
8	Saaahhhnnn!
9	Deeeeeeeee!!!
10	Gaaaaaaaaassst!!!
11	Aww, pooey...\nI thought I could make you get sand for me, too!
12	Oh well!\nThere’s plenty of other prey here on the beach!
13	Something is lying on the ground where the little\nboy had been standing...
14	... ... ...\c\nWhat a lovely sand castle!
706
0	Gaaah...
1	Hey, hey, did you notice?\nThis little fellow seems kinda troubled...
2	What do you think could be bothering it?\nDo you have any idea, Trainer?
3	It dislikes the sand’s color?
4	Maybe it’s lost?
5	Gahhh! GAHHH!!!
6	Sandygast started flailing about wildly!
7	Whoa! You’re some kind of amazing Trainer!\nYou even understand how a Sandygast feels!
8	You’re totally right, huh?\nAnyone can see it’s made up of different sand.
9	It probably doesn’t like being stuck on a black\nsand beach like this, huh?\r\nIt’s not like it’s a Shiny Pokémon after all!
10	Sand... Gah...
11	Will you take Sandygast to a different beach?
12	Hmmm...\nPoor Sandygast doesn’t seem very happy, huh?
13	Wow! You’ll help out Sandygast?\nYou’re so nice!
14	Oh, look!\nSandygast blends in lots better here!
15	Saaaaaannnd!
16	Sandygast looks really happy, too!\nThanks a lot, Trainer!
17	Here, I’ll give you this pretty thing I found on\nthe shore before. Just as a little thank-you!
18	It’s kinda surprising, huh? Even Sandygast\nhave their own likes and dislikes!

3	Oh, thank you so much! You saved my life!\nPlease, could we talk for a bit?
4	I was trying to catch a Frillish, but it called for\nhelp, and too many of them joined in.
5	I don’t mind that they’re so playful, but their\nveillike arms have a poison that paralyzes\r\nyou. I didn’t know what to do!
6	[~ 6]

8	But well, I had the chance to get rescued by\nyou, so I guess it wasn’t all bad.

10	...Oh, here’s a Destiny Knot. I’d be very happy\nif you’d keep it. You know, as a thank-you.
11	Well, I bet I’ll see you again!
12	Ugh, there are too many Frillish! I can’t even\nmove!
13	Friiiiilll...
14	Whew, thanks for getting me out of that. I owe\nyou my life! Hey, can we chat for a bit?
15	You see, I was trying to catch a Frillish, but...\nWell, it called for help, and I got overwhelmed.
16	It’s nice they’re so playful and all, but the\npoison in their veillike arms paralyzes you!\c\nI didn’t know what to do!
17	[~ 17]

19	But hey, I got to be rescued by you, so I guess\nit wasn’t a total disaster!
20	Heh, look at me. My heart’s still pounding!

1	Chu?![VAR 0114(0043)]
2	You’ve become a household name with the\nmassive success of your latest film, Chuuster!\c\nSo the rumors that you were here in Alola were\ntrue after all!\c\nHow are you spending your time off?\nWhat brought you here to Alola, now?[VAR 0114(004D)]
3	I must ask that you respect Master Chuuster’s\nprivacy and let him vacation in peace.\r\nHe will not be taking interviews at this time.
4	What! But everyone is just dying to know more\nabout the famous Chuuster’s private life!\r\nYou’ve got to spill![VAR 0114(004D)]
5	Please, miss. We’ve already asked once nicely...
6	Shoo...[VAR 0114(0043)]
7	Step in
8	Walk away
9	You want an interview, too?\nThis is my scoop! I’m not letting you have it![VAR 0114(004D)]
10	Waaaaaah!\nB-but the freedom of the press—![VAR 0114(004D)]
11	Thank you for helping us out of that rather\nsticky situation.

3	A Ditto was disguised as my partner?![VAR 0114(0050)]
4	Are the Ditto Five responsible for this?[VAR 0114(0050)]
5	The Ditto Five love humans so much that they\ntransform into humans.\c\nThey are very troublesome![VAR 0114(0050)]
6	They mean no harm, but they mess up people’s\nrelationships, so they are registered as\r\nwanted Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0050)]
7	But where in the world did my partner go?\nBy any chance, did Ditto...?![VAR 0114(0050)]
8	Sorry! I had a cold and was in bed for\na while![VAR 0114(0051)]
9	*cough cough*[VAR 0114(0050)]
10	Thank you for finding out that a Ditto was\ndisguised as my partner. Take this as thanks.[VAR 0114(0050)]
11	Lately in Konikoni City, there are sightings of\npeople who might actually be Ditto.\c\nI’m investigating these cases.[VAR 0114(0050)]
12	You found out my partner was actually a Ditto.\nIt would be reassuring if I could get your help.[VAR 0114(0050)]
13	I see... That’s too bad.[VAR 0114(0050)]
14	Ditto can transform into anything.\nIt’s an amazing Pokémon.[VAR 0114(0051)]
15	Really?!\nOf course, I’ll reward you for your cooperation![VAR 0114(0050)]
16	I’ve heard that in Konikoni City, there’s a seller\nwho interacts with customers in a bizarre way.\c\nA Ditto may be involved.[VAR 0114(0050)]

18	Di...Ditto-o-o-o-o?!
19	You managed to deal with the Ditto that was\ndisguised as the herb seller!
20	Hey, sorry for being away for a while.\c\nI was picking some herbs with Captain Mallow.
21	I’ll start selling herbs again.\nSo come see me!
22	What?! The herb seller was a Ditto![VAR 0114(0050)]
23	No wonder his interactions with customers\nwere bizarre.\c\nAlthough its appearance may be exactly the\nsame, it can’t speak a word.[VAR 0114(0050)]
24	Lately, the flavors at my favorite restaurant in\nKonikoni City seem to have changed...\c\nIt may have something to do with Ditto.[VAR 0114(0050)]
25	Dittottotto.
26	You managed to deal with the Ditto that was\ndisguised as a chef!
27	Oh no! I’m late! I’m late!
28	I ate too much yummy food and got stuck in\nthe door at my home.\c\nBut for some reason the restaurant is running\nall right... Was someone cooking?
29	What? Ditto was disguised as a chef in\nthe restaurant?![VAR 0114(0050)]
30	No wonder the flavors have been different\nlately. Ditto was cooking...[VAR 0114(0050)]
31	Lately, more and more people feel less stiff\nand tense in Konikoni City.\c\nI wonder if it has something to do with Ditto.[VAR 0114(0050)]
32	Didi!
33	You managed to deal with the Ditto that was\ndisguised as the lomi lomi massager!
34	Hmmm... Strange...
35	People in town are raving about their massages,\nsaying they make them feel like they’re melting.\c\nBut I was closed for a while.\nStrange...
36	What? The massage therapist at the lomi lomi\nmassage place was a Ditto?![VAR 0114(0050)]
37	So a Ditto was giving people\nlomi lomi massages?!\c\nOf course... If Ditto, with such a melty body,\ngave you a massage, the stiffness in your body\r\nwould just melt away, too.[VAR 0114(0050)]
38	This is not about Ditto, but lately Olivia often\ngazes at the sea alone in Konikoni City.\c\n...I wish I could be of help to her.[VAR 0114(0050)]
39	Ditto![VAR 0114(0009)]
40	You managed to deal with the Ditto that was\ndisguised as Olivia!
41	What?! The person who was gazing at the sea\nwas actually a Ditto, not Olivia?![VAR 0114(0050)]
42	Watching her from behind like that, with her\nsadness seeming to blow in the Alolan breeze...\c\nI was certain that was Olivia.[VAR 0114(0050)]
43	Thank you for dealing with the Ditto.\nThis is a reward for you![VAR 0114(0050)]
44	Please keep investigating Ditto!\nI’m counting on you![VAR 0114(0050)]
45	Wow! You managed to take care of the entire\nDitto Five![VAR 0114(0050)]
46	Thank you very much for your cooperation![VAR 0114(0050)]
47	Ditto act weird and can’t talk, so now we\ncan tell disguised Ditto from humans.[VAR 0114(0050)]
48	What if Ditto that can fully understand humans’\nminds appeared?[VAR 0114(0050)]
49	Maybe...\c\nPeople near you may have been swapped\nwith Ditto without your knowing... Haha![VAR 0114(0050)]
50	Oh, you!\nThank you for your patrol![VAR 0114(0050)]

1	But this Kantonian Gym here... This isn’t a real\nPokémon Gym. Still, I dig it here.\c\nIt’s got a feel to it, man. It’s got spirit.[VAR 0114(001A)]
2	Hey, Trainer. I can feel your spirit, too!\nWant to have a battle with Ryuki?[VAR 0114(001A)]
3	Hey, Champ! Why not have a battle with me?\nLet our fiery spirits clash in a blaze of glory![VAR 0114(001A)]
4	Sure!

6	I don’t blame you. I’m a rocker down to my\ncore, after all![VAR 0114(001A)]
7	Allow me to introduce my band mates!\nCome on, babies![VAR 0114(001A)]
8	All right! My babies were all fired up to play a\nset, but you chilled them out nicely![VAR 0114(001A)]

2	That’s a sticker?
3	You did what now?
4	Oh yes!\c\nIf young trial-goers collect these stickers as\nthey travel and follow the path they indicate,\r\nthey will quite naturally progress along their\r\nisland challenge!\c\nReally, if I had to describe them, I would say\nthese stickers really save trial-goers like you.[VAR 0114(000C)]
5	But I cannot let my guard down...\c\nThose [VAR FF00(0001)]Team Skull [VAR FF00(0000)]thugs have far too much time\non their hands, and they’re always trying to get\r\nin the way of Trainers on their island challenge.\c\nI have to keep an eye on them to be sure they\ndon’t take down my stickers.[VAR 0114(000C)]
6	I’ve actually just had a report that Team Skull\nwas seen making trouble around town.\r\nI suppose I should go have a look.[VAR 0114(000C)]
7	Well then, young [VAR 0100(0000)].\nI hope you’ll have a delightful time running\r\nabout to search out and collect Totem Stickers![VAR 0114(000C)]
8	You have an island challenge amulet!\nPlus Normalium Z and Fightinium Z!\c\nSo it would seem that you’ve cleared that\ntrial of Ilima’s, have you?\r\nAnd even battled Hala? Congratulations![VAR 0114(0030)]
9	Oh! Well, hello there. Good to meet you.\nI’m Oak—Samson Oak.\c\nI’m a Pokémon researcher, and I’m looking into\nthe Totem Pokémon found around here.[VAR 0114(0034)]
10	Yes, Totem Pokémon...\c\nWhy are they so large?\nWhat gives them that burning aura?\r\nDon’t you find yourself wondering as well?[VAR 0114(0034)]
11	I do!
12	Not really...
13	Precisely my point!\nIn that case, let me tell you this...[VAR 0114(0034)]
14	Is that so?\c\nYou may say that now, but I think that hearing\nwhat I have to propose will change your mind![VAR 0114(0034)]
15	I want you to collect certain stickers for me,\nto receive a totem-like Pokémon for yourself!\r\nThat’s right. I mean the [VAR FF00(0001)]Totem Stickers[VAR FF00(0000)]![VAR 0114(0034)]
16	You can find Totem Stickers here and there.\nPeel them off whenever you find them, and try\r\nto collect them all.[VAR 0114(0034)]
17	If you collect [VAR FF00(0001)]20[VAR FF00(0000)] Totem Stickers to show me,\nI’ll give you a fine Gumshoos![VAR 0114(0034)]
18	If you collect [VAR FF00(0001)]20[VAR FF00(0000)] Totem Stickers to show me,\nI’ll give you a fine Raticate![VAR 0114(0034)]
19	Don’t let me down, young [VAR 0100(0000)]!\c\nAfter all, you are the Trainer that Professor\nKukui entrusted with Rotom there![VAR 0114(0034)]
20	Zzzrt![VAR 0114(0035)]
21	I’ll be around [VAR FF00(0001)]Heahea Beach[VAR FF00(0000)] on Akala Island,\nif you need to ever find me!\r\nYou can reach it with a spot of Mantine Surfing.[VAR 0114(0034)]
22	Oh! Young [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nI’ve been hoping to see you again![VAR 0114(0034)]
23	It seems you’ve collected [VAR 0202(0002)] Totem Stickers!\c\nI told you I’d give you a special [VAR 0101(0001)]\nthat’s as big as a real Totem Pokémon once you\r\ngot [VAR 0202(0003)], so I guess it’s yours![VAR 0114(0034)]
24	You received [VAR 0101(0001)]!
25	Hrmmm... It looks like your Boxes are too full to\nexchange your Totem Stickers for this fine\r\ntotem-like Pokémon, ambitious young Trainer![VAR 0114(0034)]
26	So you’ve collected [VAR 0202(0002)] Totem Sticker[VAR 1101(0002,0100)]s...\nHunting them down is quite the task, isn’t it?[VAR 0114(0034)]
27	The captains and Trial Guides work hard to\nstick Totem Stickers up all around Alola.\c\nSearching them out should surely help you\nprogress through your island challenge![VAR 0114(0034)]
28	Even after finding every last Totem Sticker,\nthat doesn’t mean the quest to understand\r\nprecisely what Totem Pokémon are, or what\r\nsource their auras derive from, will end![VAR 0114(0034)]
29	Why, young [VAR 0100(0000)]!\nWe keep running into one another, don’t we?[VAR 0114(0034)]
30	When I’m feeling stuck with my research into\nregional variants and Totem Pokémon, that’s\r\nwhen I come out for a spot of Mantine Surfing!\r\nIt’s the secret to feeling all recharged![VAR 0114(0034)]
31	Though it does get my Gogoat that I can’t seem\nto ever beat that kimono-clad cad when it\r\ncomes to the ranking board...[VAR 0114(0034)]
32	Anyway! You keep collecting those Totem\nStickers, and enjoy your island challenge!\c\nI’ll be around [VAR FF00(0001)]Heahea Beach[VAR FF00(0000)] on Akala Island if\nyou ever need me![VAR 0114(0034)]

0	So you’re the one who caught the Zygarde\nthat appeared in Resolution Cave, Champion![VAR 0114(0027)]
1	We were also able to catch a Zygarde![VAR 0114(0026)]
2	Impressive!
3	Two Zygarde?
4	There’s something even more impressive![VAR 0114(0026)]
5	Correct! Two Zygarde.[VAR 0114(0026)]
6	The Zygarde you fought and captured in\nResolution Cave is in its 50% Forme. \c\nAnd the Zygarde we found is in what is known\nas its 10% Forme.[VAR 0114(0027)]
7	That’s right...50% and 10%. Zygarde can use\nvarious forms depending on the situation!\c\nIt’s quite a unique Pokémon, don’t you agree?[VAR 0114(0026)]
8	If you’re interested, I’ll give you the Zygarde we\ncaught. You could combine the two to see\r\nwhat will happen. But only if you can beat me![VAR 0114(0027)]
9	I’m up for the challenge!
10	I’m not ready yet
11	No problem. Come when you’re ready.[VAR 0114(0027)]
12	Then I’ll let my precious partners go wild![VAR 0114(0027)]
13	Not only did we find Zygarde, but I also had a\nchance to battle the Champion! Coming to\r\nAlola was definitely a good decision.[VAR 0114(0027)]
14	Take good care of Zygarde, please![VAR 0114(0027)]
15	It seems like your Boxes are full, and you\ncan’t take Zygarde. Please come back once\r\nyou’re ready![VAR 0114(0027)]
16	It’s a pleasure to meet you again, Champion.[VAR 0114(0026)]
17	Now, allow me to explain the Reassembly Unit![VAR 0114(0026)]
18	Sina...\nYou don’t waste even a second.[VAR 0114(0027)]
19	The Reassembly Unit is a device that has\nsomething to do with Zygarde.\c\nThe machine is capable of assembly and\nseparation of Zygarde.[VAR 0114(0026)]
20	Assembly is...to change the Forme of\nZygarde! Now, Dexio, it’s your turn.[VAR 0114(0026)]
21	Oh...Sina, Sina, Sina...\nAnyway...\c\nThere are two ways to assemble Zygarde.\c\nOne is to add Cells you collected\nto Zygarde.[VAR 0114(0027)]
22	The other is to create a new Zygarde with\nonly Cells!\c\nYou see, Zygarde can change its Forme by\ngathering parts of itself known as Cells![VAR 0114(0026)]
23	Next we’ll explain about separation.[VAR 0114(0027)]
24	To separate Zygarde...\nIt means to return Zygarde to its Cells![VAR 0114(0026)]
25	Separated Cells will be returned to the\nZygarde Cube.[VAR 0114(0027)]
26	For your information, according to the research\nby the professor who’s sent us to Alola,\r\nZygarde is divided into 100 Cells and Cores.[VAR 0114(0027)]
27	Depending on the number of Cells and Cores,\nthe shape of Zygarde will be different...\r\nIn other words, Zygarde changes its Forme![VAR 0114(0026)]
28	Oh, I almost forgot! We need to give you the\nZygarde Cube, too![VAR 0114(0026)]
29	It also has the 40 Zygarde Cells we gathered.[VAR 0114(0026)]
30	Zygarde is said to maintain the order of the\nKalos region...so then why is it in Alola?\c\nDoes it have something to do with the Ultra\nBeasts that have appeared?[VAR 0114(0027)]
31	Who knows...? Maybe Zygarde itself will tell\nus someday.\c\nAnyhow...we’ll be taking our leave now!\nBon voyage![VAR 0114(0026)]
718
0	This is excellent! Exciting, even! Alola is proving\nto be just full of surprises!
1	If a Trainer trusts his or her Pokémon, even in\nthe most extreme of situations, the Pokémon\r\ninevitably respond by unleashing their full\r\npower! Just like that Trainer I once met...
2	There was only one answer I could reach. And\nin Alola, that answer takes the form of Z-Moves!
3	I can now see with my own eyes the invisible\npower between Trainers and Pokémon...\c\nZ-Moves give it form!
4	The Z-Power Ring and Z-Crystals... Their\nunknown energy will open doors to new worlds!
5	I must know... Why did Necrozma give its light\nenergy to the Pokémon of Alola in the form of\r\nauras?! As Z-Power?!\c\nHmm... If I want to find out more about moves,\nI suppose I should ask Professor Kukui, or even\r\nthe Masked Royal! Maybe I’ll go battle them![VAR 0114(002B)]

0	Why, hello, Champion!\nAlola to you![VAR 0114(0008)]
1	I’ve got an idea! Since you’ve taken the trouble\nto come visit old Hala, could I ask you to help\r\nan old Trainer brush up his moves?[VAR 0114(0008)]
2	I’d be happy to!
3	I’m sort of busy...
4	In that case... Well, stay as long as you wish![VAR 0114(0008)]
5	In that case... We must go to a location\nbefitting the Champion of Alola![VAR 0114(0008)]
6	Now... I’ll hold nothing back! It’s time you\nremembered what I can really do! Old Hala is\r\nhere to make you holler![VAR 0114(0008)]
7	To see one I sent out on the island challenge\nreturn with so much strength and energy...\c\nCould anything be more fulfilling than to feel it\nfirsthand along with my awesome Pokémon?[VAR 0114(0008)]
8	[~ 8]
9	[~ 9]
10	[~ 10]
11	That should help you get stronger, my [VAR 1100(00FF,0403)]boygirl![VAR 0114(0008)]
12	You should show Tapu Koko what you learned\nduring the island challenge, [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0008)]
13	Our guardians can be fickle and seem to toy\nwith us, but perhaps that is only to make us\r\nthink about whether or not our long-accepted\r\nrules and traditions are right.[VAR 0114(0008)]
728
0	[VAR 0100(0000)]...[VAR 0114(0006)]

4	Nebby...\nYou came here from very far away, didn’t you?\c\nI’m glad that I could take you with me...\nthat we got to experience that journey together.[VAR 0114(0006)]
5	[VAR 0100(0000)], I know this may be sudden,\nbut I hope you will consider what I ask of you.\c\nI want to entrust Nebby to you.\c\nI think Nebby should be with Necrozma.\c\nFrom what I’ve heard, Necrozma would not\nsuffer as much or ache so for the light if it\r\ncan remain close to Nebby...[VAR 0114(0006)]
6	And I think it’d be best...if they both stayed\ntogether with you, [VAR 0100(0000)].\c\nI’ve thought a lot about it and that’s what\nI decided, so...please...\c\nI want you to face Nebby as only a Trainer can.\nAnd I want you to give it a ball to call home.[VAR 0114(0006)]

12	I know that you will be able to keep everyone\nsmiling and happy, [VAR 0100(0000)].\r\nThank you for taking care of Nebby for me. [VAR 0114(0006)]
13	Nebby...\nI’m going to become stronger. I swear I will!\c\nNow it will be your turn to watch over me as I\ngrow, OK? Please watch me...[VAR 0114(0006)]
14	And this, [VAR 0100(0000)]...\nNebby was holding it.\r\nPlease use it with care.[VAR 0114(0006)]
15	Now let’s go, [VAR 0100(0000)]![VAR 0114(0006)]

0	So this is Poni Island... I can tell that only the\nbest Trainers in all of Alola gather here.[VAR 0114(0030)]
1	Nature and Pokémon and people, surviving\ntogether in their own harsh way...[VAR 0114(0030)]
2	That’s no reason to come here and train, Chief!\c\nYou’re supposed to be on vacation! I would like\nto make it clear that I think this is a mistake![VAR 0114(001F)]
3	Hm? You... You’re the Trainer I gave the\nThunder Stone to on Akala Island, correct?[VAR 0114(001F)]
4	You must be the first Champion of Alola.\c\nMy name is Anabel, and I am part of the\nInternational Police. It is a pleasure to meet you.[VAR 0114(0029)]
5	The Champion?! You always impress me, Chief.\nIs there anything you don’t know?[VAR 0114(001F)]
6	It seems as if you’re in the middle of a mission.\nYou should wrap that up first. They are tough\r\nopponents, but you and your Pokémon should\r\nbe able to handle them.[VAR 0114(0029)]
7	Ah, so you’re on a mission, too? I’ve got my\nhands full as well.[VAR 0114(001F)]
8	I plan to train at the Battle Tree, so as to be\nable to complete any assignment as a member\r\nof the International Police.\r\nUntil we meet again...[VAR 0114(0029)]
9	It was good to run into you, Champion!\nSadly, I only have this item called a Red Card.\r\nPlease keep it as a memento of this encounter![VAR 0114(001F)]
10	The Red Card forcefully switches any Pokémon\nthat lands an attack on the Pokémon holding it.\c\nBut once it’s activated, the item itself is lost![VAR 0114(001F)]
11	*sigh*\c\nI’d never hear the end of it from Nanu if I let\nanything happen to the chief.\c\nMy new partner isn’t very strong, but it looks\nlike I have to go to the Battle Tree, regardless!\c\nBut only as a bodyguard, of course.\nWell then, alola![VAR 0114(001F)]

12	In this city, we’re proud to live together with\nPokémon, and that’s why we have so many\r\npatches of tall grass right here in the city.\c\nYoung Ilima and his Smeargle are always working\nhard to keep the gates around the grass looking\r\ntip-top, as well.\c\nCaptains should be responsible types, after all!
13	I think I took a wrong turn in life...\nIs there any map for that?
14	The more you walk with your Pokémon,\nthe friendlier they grow toward you!
15	Alola was originally only home to Pokémon.\c\nPeople came along later, and they would’ve had\na rough go of it without those Pokémon’s help.

1	When you begin to level up as a Trainer and\nlearn advanced strategies, you’ll want to pay\r\nattention to Abilities. They can be a huge help!
2	All Pokémon have some sort of Ability...\c\nBut even members of the same species don’t\nalways have the same Ability as one another.\c\nWhich Ability you’ll want your Pokémon to have\nwill depend somewhat on how you like to battle.
3	Let’s see here...\c\nSo, if you choose to view a Pokémon’s summary,\nyou can see what Ability that Pokémon has.\c\nWhen you touch the “i” for more information,\nyou can see what that Ability does.\c\nMaybe I’d remember it all better if the textbook\nwasn’t written to be so boring!
4	My Lillipup picked this up.\nHere, you take it.
5	Lillipup’s Ability is Pickup!\c\nIt’s an awesome Ability that works even when\nyou’re not in battle.\c\nI went all the way to Akala Island to find a\nLillipup and catch it just to have this Ability.
6	There is writing on the blackboard.\c\nIt describes some of the physical changes that\na Pokémon can experience in battle.
7	What would you like to read about?
8	If a Pokémon is poisoned, it will steadily lose HP\nduring battle.\c\nThe poison won’t disappear after the battle\neither, so heal poisoning with an Antidote.
9	Paralysis reduces Speed and may prevent\nPokémon from using any moves.\c\nParalysis also lingers after battle, so use a\nParalyze Heal to clear up its nasty effects.
10	If a Pokémon falls asleep, it will be unable to\nattack till it wakes.\c\nThe Pokémon may wake up on its own, but if\nthe battle ends first, then it will stay asleep.\c\nYou can wake it up using an Awakening.
11	Burns lower a Pokémon’s Attack and steadily\nreduce its HP. They linger even after battle.\c\nYou can cure burns using a Burn Heal.
12	If a Pokémon is frozen, it becomes completely\nhelpless.\c\nIt may thaw out on its own, but if the battle\nends first, it will remain frozen thereafter.\c\nYou can thaw it out using an Ice Heal.

3	The Guardian Deities of the Islands\nThe tapu regularly keep themselves closed tight\nin their shells as they absorb nature’s energy.\nAfter many long years of absorbing such energy,\ntheir shells become hard and sturdy.
4	The Tapu and the Island Kahunas\nThe tapu choose the kahunas of their islands\nand entrust them with special Sparkling Stones.\nWhat reasoning they use to make such a choice,\nhowever, is not at all apparent to observers.
5	The Guardians and the Ancient Kings\nIn ancient times, the tapu served as the leaders\nof the armies of each island’s king, but if they\nused their Z-Power in battle, it caused great\ndestruction across the islands.\c\nBecause of this, the tapu came to no longer\nlend their aid in the wars of men.

4	Here in the Alola region, volcanic eruptions can\nresult in long, thin strands of magma...\r\nThey form strands of glass rather like hair!\c\nBut the hair on the Diglett here is not glass,\nbut rather whiskers of some metallic substance.\c\nThey use them for communication and as a sort\nof sensor to investigate their surroundings.[VAR 0114(0034)]

10	Are you a visitor? No worries. We can dig it!\nHere at the Geothermal Power Plant, we love\r\nhaving more pals to share our energy with!
11	The Steam Separator\c\nGeothermal reservoirs underground contain\nhigh-pressure water that has been heated up\r\nby the magma within the planet.\c\nThis device helps separate the heated fluid\nfrom the reservoirs into steam and hot water.
12	Regarding Steam Turbines\c\nBy directing steam to pass over the turbine’s\nblades and spin it on its axis, you can keep the\r\nturbine in motion to generate power.
13	The Generator\c\nThe steam turbines spin at a speed of 3,600\nrevolutions per minute, powering the generator\r\nand producing electricity.\c\nIt may seem like the generator organ in Vikavolt,\nbut it works on an entirely different principle.
14	The Cooling Tower\c\nThis is where the water from the steam used\nby the generator cools.\c\nOnce the water has been cooled sufficiently, it\ncan then be reused to cool more steam.
15	Producing Geothermal Energy: Step 1\c\nWith the help of digging Pokémon, scientists\nsearch for underground steam vents in the\r\narea around active volcanoes.
16	Producing Geothermal Energy: Step 2\c\nOver a long period of time, and with the help of\nmany Pokémon that can work underground,\r\nthe power plant is constructed.
17	Producing Geothermal Energy: Step 3\c\nThe steam that is naturally produced due to\nunderground heat is used to turn turbines and\r\ngenerate electricity.
18	Producing Geothermal Energy: Step 4\c\nThe Geothermal Power Plant produces clean\nenergy that is good for the environment, thanks\r\nto its relatively small carbon footprint.

9	It’s like it tore a hole in space...\nDoes this world connect to...somewhere else?
10	Starmie is known as the Mysterious Pokémon.\c\nIf it’s really a star from the night sky appearing\nto us in a different form...\c\nThen it’s like a Pokémon is just using us humans\nand making us take care of it.\r\nDo you ever imagine things like that? I do.
11	Wh-what is that hole?!\nWhat is going on?!
12	Sudowoodo is a Pokémon that pretends to be a\ntree in order to protect itself.\c\nBut...wouldn’t it be better to disguise itself as\nthe kind of tree you actually see here in Alola?\r\nOr would that make it seem like an Exeggutor?
13	Wood?
14	The PC Boxes were first developed by a guy\nin the Kanto region called Bill.\r\nApparently he’s a real Pokémon maniac!
15	Imagine using the same Pokémon in your Boxes\nin battle again after hundreds of years...\r\nIt’s like a kind of time machine, isn’t it?
16	We are also protecting so-called\nregional variants.\c\nWhat is it in the climate and features that is\naffecting the Pokémon?\c\nWe are trying to determine that by testing\ndifferent parameters, such as the local soil,\r\nwater, and temperature.
17	I’m in no position to face my children now...\c\nI’ve lost any right to claim that I am protecting\nPokémon as well...\c\nIf I can’t be a mother to them, and I’m no longer\nworthy to be the president of this foundation...\r\nthen what am I to be?[VAR 0114(0014)]
18	I am Lusamine.\c\nI am the president of this foundation and\nmother to Gladion and Lillie.\c\nAnd while I will pour my love into protecting\nPokémon and my children from pain...\c\nI will also try to be strong enough to watch over\nthem without interfering from now on.\c\nThat would be an even more beautiful kind of\nlove, wouldn’t you say?\c\nI learned to think this way after watching you...\nyoung [VAR 0100(0000)].[VAR 0114(0014)]
19	No matter what life may bring you, if you can\nkeep on smiling as you enjoy a tasty malasada\r\nwith the people and Pokémon you love, then\r\nyou’ll be fine in the end.[VAR 0114(0016)]

0	This is Aether Paradise.\c\nIt’s actually a VLFS or a “very large floating\nstructure” to you, I suppose.\r\nIt’s all made up of huge blocks stuck together.\c\nI guess you could call it a new island, which we\ncreated and set to float here in Alola’s waves!
1	We use the motion of the waves to generate\nelectricity to power the whole building.
2	We get more than just ferry boats in here.\nWe also have things brought in by cargo boat.
3	There are some things in life you just can’t do\nanything about.\r\nYou’ll be happier if you don’t think about them.
4	Whenever we try to help some Pokémon or\nanother, that Team Skull gets in our way!\r\nI’ve got a real bone to pick with them!
5	I was working in Driftveil for a while, helping\nPokémon that got separated from their Trainers.\r\nBut I left once things settled down there.
6	Can’t you see I’m in the middle of work here!\nGet outta here! It’s not safe for kids!
7	We’re checking to make sure that no Pokémon\nhave slipped in and come along for the ride.\c\nCan’t be too sure, when we’ve got non-native\nPokémon like Grimer taking over here in Alola!\r\nInvasive species are not to be taken lightly.

6	This is the blog of F, a branch chief working in\nthe Alola region.\c\nTitle: Introduction\c\nAre you interested in success, dear readers?\nThen allow me to introduce myself.\c\nMy name is F, and I am an elite, self-made man.\c\nHere on my blog, I will show you the way\nto succeed.
7	This is the blog of F, a branch chief working in\nthe Alola region.\c\nTitle: Multitasking\c\nCurrently I am working on the development of a\nspecial sort of ball, which I took over from my\r\npredecessor, in parallel with another project.\c\nSeeing how well I multitask impresses my\nsubordinates and increases their motivation.\c\nShowing how skillful you are is a kind of \non-the-job training for your underlings.
8	This is the blog of F, a branch chief working in\nthe Alola region.\c\nTitle: Hedging risks\c\nI once ventured to undertake a project without\nnotifying my superior.\c\nI developed a device to restrain a dangerous life\nform, in case it became necessary to do so.\c\nI had it made for hedging risks to protect\nmyself, but for better or worse, it was\r\nmade public.\c\nIt is always essential to consider the risks\nbefore one takes action.
9	This is the blog of F, a branch chief working in\nthe Alola region.\c\nTitle: Massaging the truth\c\nMy superior’s family stole the results of our\nresearch and ran off.\c\nHowever, I have chosen to never blow this issue\nout of proportion.\c\nI will only be reprimanded for my own mistakes,\nand surely my superior is also displeased with\r\nthe actions of her family as well.\c\nWhen necessary, one must always be prepared\nto massage the truth to protect one’s own\r\nposition. It is not an exaggeration to say that\r\nthis skill is vital for success.

22	BKP Development Record #18\c\nProduction of three models has been completed.\nThey are identified as serial number 01, serial\r\nnumber 02, and serial number 03.\c\nAll three models rejected the RKS System upon\ninitialization during testing.\c\nShortly after these initialization errors, all three\nmodels of Type: Full went berserk.
23	BKP Development Record #44\c\nModels have been fitted with control masks to\nmitigate the effects of their rejection of the\r\nRKS System.\c\nDue to the implementation of these control\nmasks, our RKS System initialization tests\r\nhave failed.\c\nAll three models of Type: Full are to be\ncryogenically frozen for the rest of eternity.\c\nThe name of these models has been changed\nfrom Type: Full to Type: Null.

263	Which shards will you trade?
264	Are you OK with trading [VAR 0202(0000)] [VAR 1001][VAR 0109(0001)]\nfor one Bottle Cap?
265	All right. The trade is done!\nUse it wisely, young [VAR 1100(00FF,0403)]manlady!
266	Do you want to trade again?
267	But you don’t have enough colored shards.\c\nI’ll trade your shards for my Bottle Cap when\nyou collect [VAR 0202(0000)] shards with the same color,\r\nsuch as Red Shards.

1	Huh? But you’re not wearing any protective\ngear... Could it be you’re from a different world?
2	...Huh? You don’t know what I mean?\nOh, are you from a different world?
3	Well, I guess it doesn’t really matter. Please,\nmake yourself at home! I know it’s a bit of a\r\nmess here, but...
4	If you want to head out, just follow the pipe.
5	Everyone else ran off to some distant planet.\nBut since Mr. Glutton is still here and all, I felt\r\nlike, y’know, maybe I should stick around, too.
6	Hey, wow, you actually were able to keep up\nwith Mr. Glutton! It’ll be back once it gets\r\nhungry. I bet it would love to play again, too!
7	Mr. Glutton really seems to like you! You’re an\ninteresting person, that’s for sure.\c\nMr. Glutton will eat just about anything, but\nplease, take good care of it!
8	Hey there! Come for a bit of chitchat?
9	Tell me about Guzzlord
10	What’s that leaking machine?
11	So, that damaged screen...
12	What’s up with that suit?
13	No, I’m good
14	Guzzlord...? Oh, you mean Mr. Glutton? His kind\nhave lived on this planet since long before I was\r\neven born.\c\nThey eat anything, and I mean literally anything.\nTrash, toxic waste, you name it. But their\r\nnumbers seem to be decreasing these days.
15	Oh, that’s a filtering machine to make the dirty\nwater here clean. But one of the pipes broke,\r\nso there’s a bit of a leak. The water-purity level\r\nis still pretty high, so it should be safe to drink\r\nfor now.
16	It starts playing videos and music and such if\nyou put it in a bright spot.\c\nI’ve never seen it aside from on the monitor, but\nI guess that’s the color folks used to call “blue.”
17	I heard that back in the day, people would\nspend a lot of time every day worrying about\r\nwhat to wear. Things are much less complicated\r\nnow, since the only choice is this suit.\c\nBreathe too much of the air around here without\nthe suit, and it can be very dangerous.\c\nUh, actually, you may want to keep breathing to\na minimum if you’re going outside.
18	Oh, come again anytime!
19	What are all those cards?
20	That power plant poster...
21	I found a faded sign...
22	Oh, those? Each little card is a storage device—\nthey can hold a huge amount of information.\c\nAll the data in the world could fit on one\nbookshelf! But the machine used to read them\r\nis broken, so they’re not much use now...
23	You noticed that poster, did you? I found it\nburied in the rubble and decided to put it up.\c\nThe people from my grandparents’ generation\nburned most of them, so they’re hard to find!\c\nWhenever I brought up the power plant, it\nseemed like the adults didn’t want to hear\r\nabout it, but I like that poster. It’s cheerful.
24	Apparently, that sign is from an older era than\nthe rest of the rubble around here. It’s a bit sad\r\nI can’t read all of it, but it’s just so rusted...\c\nIt must have been placed in an area that was\nrough on metal or something.
25	What do Guzzlord eat?
26	They’ll eat anything they find, like rubble, waste,\nwhatever. They have a huge appetite, so we\r\ncouldn’t take them to the other planets...\c\nOh! Please, don’t mess too much with\nMr. Glutton’s food out back.

1	Zzzzzt! Thizzz place is completely wrecked!\nWhat in the world happened here?
2	There’s too much rubble in the way.\nYou won’t be able to pass through here.
3	Cards labeled “Relocation Notice” are scattered\nall over the place.
4	A poster for an apparel shop is stuck sideways.\n“Every day is a summer sale! Amazing fashion\r\nhas never been more affordable!”
5	A poster for the power plant is stuck sideways.\n“Safe and secure! Let our power light up\r\nyour lives!”
6	...oli... ...ity Ha...\n“Servi... ... ...ity’s... ...need...”
7	The letters were too faded to read clearly.

5	Team Rocket came in and took over everything\nso quickly. They were like...well, like a rocket.
6	I need to be the first to get an interview with\nthe leader of Team Rocket! Better start training\r\nmy Pokémon!
7	My camcorder got busted in all the excitement!\nIt’s all Team Rocket’s fault! I’m gonna report on\r\nevery dirty little secret they have!
8	At least it seems Team Rocket aren’t in the\nunderground lab or the conservation area...
9	Prrf...
10	I thought a Janitor might be let into the mansion,\nbut they chased me away—just like that!
11	Ms. Wicke has been requesting aid from all the\nislands. Is that how you found out, Champion?
