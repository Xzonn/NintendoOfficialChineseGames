BuddyHint_1	What do you think would happen if\nyou hopped on that shell? Maybe\nit'll hit all the enemies behind it?
BuddyHint_2	Those flying enemies might be too\nhigh to reach with your hammer...
BuddyHint_3	Argh! I hate sharp things. That spike\nwill pierce right through your regular\nboots...and feet!
BuddyHint_4	Those boney guys are so creepy...\nWhat if we beat one, but it comes\nright back on the next turn? Aah!\nThat sounds like a horror movie!
BuddyHint_5	That enemy looks tough... It might\neven be tough enough to repel\nfireballs and stuff! {s[075]}Hey, that rhymed!{s[100]}
BuddyHint_6	If the hammer doesn't work, why not\ntry stomping on it with your boots?
BuddyHint_7	They can vanish?! What a pain!\nGood thing you memorized which\npanels they were on...right, Mario?
BuddyHint_8	Your hammer and boots both have\ndifferent attack ranges. Choose the\nright attack for the right enemy!
BuddyHint_101	Don't leave those angry enemies\nalone for too long. They might hit\nyou with super-strong attacks!
BuddyHint_103	Careful, Mario! Your HP is low!\nThis would be a great time to use\na Mushroom, don't you think?
BuddyHint_104	Look who's here, Mario! Your friends\nwill join you in battles too. They've\ngot your back! Go, team!
BuddyHint_1001	Better keep an eye on that timer.\nIf the clock runs out, the board\nwill lock in place!
BuddyHint_1002	Looks like you can only move the\nrings around a set number of times\nper turn. Think carefully!
BuddyHint_1003	Move the rings around to arrange\nthe enemies. That's one of the\nbasics of battling!
BuddyHint_2001	Surprise! If you need a hint during\nbattles, just press  to call me.\nI promise to do my best!
BuddyHint_2002	You can press  to have Toads join\nin and cheer you on!\x0e\0\x04\0If you hold down , you'll spend\nmore coins and the effect will be\neven stronger! Let's go, Toads!
BuddyHint_2003	If running away seems like your\nbest option, it looks like you just\nneed to hold down !\x0e\0\x04\0It won't always work, though, and\nsome battles won't let you run away\nat all. Try not to depend on it!
BuddyHint_2004	Don't forget to use items! Some of\nthem can be surprisingly powerful!
BuddyHint_2005	If you aren't able to line the enemies\nup just right, try using an item. Some\nof them might help out a lot!
BuddyHint_2006	Uh-oh. Looks like you can't run\naway this time! We don't have a\nchoice...so let's get 'em!

BtlAudience_Entry_HBE_002	What a weird Koopa...
BtlAudience_Entry_HBE_003	It's so huge!
BtlAudience_Cmd_HBE_001	Hey! Don't bully the tortoise!
BtlAudience_Cmd_HBE_002	Aim for its feet!
BtlAudience_Cmd_HBE_003	What a tough shell...
BtlAudience_Cmd_HBE_004	Use the 1,000-Fold Arms!
BtlAudience_Cmd_HBE_005	Where did its legs go?!
BtlAudience_Cmd_HBE_006	How do you beat this thing?!
BtlAudience_Cmd_HBE_007	I helped! You're welcome!
BtlAudience_Win_HBE_001	I want 1,000-Fold Arms too!
BtlAudience_Win_HBE_002	So awesome!
BtlAudience_BOSS_earth001	Something big is coming...
BtlAudience_BOSS_earth002	Lift it up, Mario! HEAVE!
BtlAudience_BOSS_earth003	It's the tail! Go for the tail!
BtlAudience_Entry_HBW_001	Whoa! Water Vellumental!
BtlAudience_Entry_HBW_002	So cool!
BtlAudience_Entry_HBW_003	Why is it so mad?
BtlAudience_Cmd_HBW_001	Will that attack even reach?
BtlAudience_Cmd_HBW_002	Don't get flooded!
BtlAudience_Cmd_HBW_003	Are we in the splash zone?
BtlAudience_Cmd_HBW_004	Oh! Here's your chance!
BtlAudience_Cmd_HBW_005	Must be low tide.
BtlAudience_Cmd_HBW_006	From torrent to trickle!
BtlAudience_BOSS_aqua001	Uh-oh! Surf's up!
BtlAudience_BOSS_aqua002	It's gonna flood the panels!
BtlAudience_BOSS_aqua003	Phew! Magic Circle!
BtlAudience_Win_aqua001	Aw, my vest got wet...
BtlAudience_Win_aqua002	Water way to go!
BtlAudience_Entry_HBF_001	Wow! Fire Vellumental!
BtlAudience_Entry_HBF_002	Hot stuff!
BtlAudience_Entry_HBF_003	Finally! A fire fight!
BtlAudience_Cmd_HBF_001	Save your feet from the heat!
BtlAudience_Cmd_HBF_002	Maybe his hammer will reach?
BtlAudience_Cmd_HBF_003	Not the Ice Flower? Really?
BtlAudience_Cmd_HBF_004	Soak that spicy chicken!
BtlAudience_Cmd_HBF_005	It's missing a few feathers!
BtlAudience_Cmd_HBF_006	Are those arms fireproof?
BtlAudience_BOSS_fire001	It smells AMAZING in here.
BtlAudience_BOSS_fire002	Uh-oh. I stared directly at it...
BtlAudience_BOSS_fire003	Hot enough for ya?
BtlAudience_BOSS_fire004	Aah! Put out those flames!
BtlAudience_BOSS_fire005	Extinguish it! Use water!
BtlAudience_Win_FIR001	That made me hungry.
BtlAudience_Win_FIR002	Whoof! I'm all sweaty now.
BtlAudience_Entry_HBI_001	Woo! Ice Vellumental!
BtlAudience_Entry_HBI_002	It IS a polar bear!
BtlAudience_Entry_HBI_003	It's too cold in here!
BtlAudience_Cmd_HBI_001	It's not cold. It's FREEZING.
BtlAudience_Cmd_HBI_002	What should he do here?
BtlAudience_Cmd_HBI_003	I want ice cream now...
BtlAudience_Cmd_HBI_004	It's freezing them out!
BtlAudience_Cmd_HBI_005	That looks so cold...
BtlAudience_Cmd_HBI_006	This could get dicey and icy!
BtlAudience_BOSS_ice001	Break the ice! Ask how it is!
BtlAudience_BOSS_ice002	Melt it with fire!
BtlAudience_BOSS_ice003	Hurry up! I'm freezing!
BtlAudience_BOSS_ice004	Attacks won't work?! Oh no!
BtlAudience_BOSS_ice005	Try the 1,000-Fold Arms!
BtlAudience_BOSS_ice006	Now's your chance!
BtlAudience_BOSS_ice007	Spin it back! Make a path!
BtlAudience_BOSS_ice008	I already forgot how it looked.
BtlAudience_Win_ICE001	Knew I shoulda worn a coat.
BtlAudience_Win_ICE002	An ironically heated battle!
BtlAudience_Guard_ICE_001	Oh no! He froze up!
BtlAudience_Guard_ICE_002	I can't watch!
BtlAudience_Entry_PEN_001	Wow! Art supplies!
BtlAudience_Entry_PEN_002	Ooh, that is a NICE case...
BtlAudience_Entry_PEN_003	Colored pencils? Really?
BtlAudience_Cmd_PEN_001	Red's my favorite!
BtlAudience_Cmd_PEN_002	Whoa! Flying colors!
BtlAudience_Cmd_PEN_003	I believe in you!
BtlAudience_Cmd_PEN_004	It's making me dizzy...
BtlAudience_Cmd_PEN_005	Ohhh, this looks bad.
BtlAudience_Cmd_PEN_006	Try to grab 'em!
BtlAudience_Cmd_PEN_007	Slam that art snob!
BtlAudience_Cmd_PEN_008	Give it all you've got!
BtlAudience_Cmd_PEN_009	Watch it!
BtlAudience_Win_PEN_001	Color me impressed!
BtlAudience_Win_PEN_002	He needs to sharpen his skills.
BtlAudience_BOSS_pecil001	That lid looks flimsy...
BtlAudience_BOSS_pecil002	Art supplies are expensive.
BtlAudience_BOSS_pecil003	Close the lid! CLOSE IT!
BtlAudience_BOSS_pecil004	Those reticles look...ominous.
BtlAudience_BOSS_pecil005	PENCIL RAAAIN!
BtlAudience_BOSS_pecil006	That lid won't close!
BtlAudience_Entry_GOM_001	Yeesh. Nightmare fuel.
BtlAudience_Entry_GOM_002	I can't...look away...
BtlAudience_Entry_GOM_003	Eww, it's all floppy...
BtlAudience_Cmd_GOM_001	He's gonna bounce all over!
BtlAudience_Cmd_GOM_002	Maybe your hammer?
BtlAudience_Cmd_GOM_003	Whoa! So far!
BtlAudience_Cmd_GOM_004	Is that the real rubber band?!
BtlAudience_Cmd_GOM_005	That's one beefy rubber band!
BtlAudience_Cmd_GOM_006	Stretch it to the max!
BtlAudience_BOSS_gom001	Send that rubber band flying!
BtlAudience_BOSS_gom002	Yank on it!
BtlAudience_BOSS_gom003	It's still alive?!
BtlAudience_BOSS_gom004	I thought he had it for sure!
BtlAudience_BOSS_gom005	Press  to guard!
BtlAudience_Win_GOM001	That looked tough!
BtlAudience_Win_GOM002	What a cool finisher!
BtlAudience_Guard_GOM_001	He can't guard?! Yikes!
BtlAudience_Guard_GOM_002	Jump with !
BtlAudience_KNP_Punch_Enter_001	I'm feelin' it!
BtlAudience_KNP_Punch_Enter_002	Let's party!
BtlAudience_KNP_Punch_Enter_003	Cut a rug!
BtlAudience_KNP_Punch_Enter_004	Spin it like a DJ!
BtlAudience_KNP_Punch_Enter_005	Slide from side to side!
BtlAudience_KNP_Punch_Cmd_001	Try a Mushroom!
BtlAudience_KNP_Punch_Cmd_002	Hammer! Lay down a beat!
BtlAudience_KNP_Punch_Cmd_003	Jump, baby, jump!
BtlAudience_KNP_Punch_Win_001	You out-danced him!
BtlAudience_KNP_Punch_Win_002	Smooth moves!
BtlAudience_KNP_Punch_Win_003	Aw, I wanted to dance more...
BtlAudience_KNP_Punch_Attack_01	So cool!
BtlAudience_KNP_Punch_Attack_02	Go, Mario, go!
BtlAudience_KNP_Punch_Attack_03	Show us your moves!
BtlAudience_KNP_Punch_GodHand_01	Yes! Put those hands up!
BtlAudience_KNP_Punch_GodHand_02	Gotta hand it to him!
BtlAudience_KNP_Punch_GodHand_03	1,000-Fold Arms! Woo!
BtlAudience_KNP_Punch_Olivia_01	Lookin' good, Olivia!
BtlAudience_KNP_Punch_Olivia_02	She's my favorite.
BtlAudience_KNP_Punch_Olivia_03	Fever!
BtlAudience_KNP_Punch_Guard_01	Oh, he's dancing DIRTY.
BtlAudience_KNP_Punch_Guard_02	Ouch!
BtlAudience_BOSS_punch001	Mind the gaps!
BtlAudience_BOSS_punch002	That lid looks weak to me!
BtlAudience_BOSS_punch003	Yeah! A Magic Circle!
BtlAudience_Entry_TAP_001	Oh jeez...
BtlAudience_Entry_TAP_002	Where should he aim first?
BtlAudience_Entry_TAP_003	It's like a tank!
BtlAudience_Cmd_TAP_001	Try your hammer!
BtlAudience_Cmd_TAP_002	Can he break the dispenser?
BtlAudience_Cmd_TAP_003	Aha! It was a roll of tape!
BtlAudience_Cmd_TAP_004	Is the dispenser its body?!
BtlAudience_Cmd_TAP_005	Looks like that rubber band...
BtlAudience_Cmd_TAP_006	The tape finally ran out!
BtlAudience_BOSS_tape001	Smash its dispenser!
BtlAudience_BOSS_tape002	How's he supposed to grab it?
BtlAudience_BOSS_tape003	Yank that tape! Go, go, go!
BtlAudience_BOSS_tape004	Peel the whole thing!
BtlAudience_Win_TAP001	That was a weird one.
BtlAudience_Win_TAP002	Bada bing!
BtlAudience_Entry_SCS_001	Scissors! Yikes!
BtlAudience_Entry_SCS_002	Looks sharp...
BtlAudience_Entry_SCS_003	Careful!
BtlAudience_Cmd_SCS_001	Take off the cover! It'll be OK!
BtlAudience_Cmd_SCS_002	If the cover's safe, so are you!
BtlAudience_Cmd_SCS_003	Avoid the cover! Play it safe!
BtlAudience_Cmd_SCS_004	Watch where you're pointing!
BtlAudience_Cmd_SCS_005	Agh! He's gonna get cut!
BtlAudience_Cmd_SCS_006	Too dangerous!
BtlAudience_BOSS_scissor001	Don't break the cover!
BtlAudience_BOSS_scissor002	What if we're next? Nooo!
BtlAudience_BOSS_scissor003	He won't get cut...right?
BtlAudience_BOSS_scissor004	Stop it from moving!
BtlAudience_Win_SCS001	He cut that one close...
BtlAudience_Win_SCS002	Phew! Nice job!
BtlAudience_Guard_SCS_001	Dodge!
BtlAudience_Guard_SCS_002	Press  to jump!
BtlAudience_Entry_STP_001	It's...a dog?!
BtlAudience_Entry_STP_002	It's kinda cool looking...
BtlAudience_Entry_STP_003	Try not to get bit!
BtlAudience_Cmd_STP_001	Sit! Stay! Roll over?
BtlAudience_Cmd_STP_002	Bop it from above!
BtlAudience_Cmd_STP_003	Yeah! That's the stuff, Mario!
BtlAudience_Cmd_STP_004	Here's your chance!
BtlAudience_Cmd_STP_005	Aww, poor dizzy dog...
BtlAudience_Cmd_STP_006	Don't let your guard down...
BtlAudience_BOSS_stapler001	Use up all its staples!
BtlAudience_BOSS_stapler002	It's gone berserk!
BtlAudience_BOSS_stapler003	Down, boy! Heel!
BtlAudience_Win_STP001	That thing needed a leash!
BtlAudience_Win_STP002	I should get a dog.
BtlAudience_Guard_STP001	Nooo! He's been stapled!
BtlAudience_Guard_STP002	He's stuck! He can't guard!
BtlAudience_Entry_KNG_001	Don't lose, Mario!
BtlAudience_Entry_KNG_002	Good luck!
BtlAudience_Entry_KNG_003	Stop that little jerk!
BtlAudience_Cmd_KNG_001	Aah! Earth Vellumental!
BtlAudience_Cmd_KNG_002	It turned into a big turtle!
BtlAudience_Cmd_KNG_003	He's really worked up!
BtlAudience_Cmd_KNG_004	It's the Water Vellumental!
BtlAudience_Cmd_KNG_005	I don't like the look of this...
BtlAudience_Cmd_KNG_006	Be careful!
BtlAudience_Cmd_KNG_007	The Fire Vellumental's here!
BtlAudience_Cmd_KNG_008	Somebody do something!
BtlAudience_Cmd_KNG_009	Hot! Too hot!
BtlAudience_Cmd_KNG_010	Ice Vellumental! Oh no!
BtlAudience_Cmd_KNG_011	So c-c-cold...
BtlAudience_Cmd_KNG_012	Go, go, Mario!
BtlAudience_BOSS_KNG001	Will he get caught?
BtlAudience_BOSS_KNG002	Make it so he can't move!
BtlAudience_BOSS_KNG003	Can't do it like normal, huh?
BtlAudience_BOSS_KNG004	Should we do the wave?
BtlAudience_BOSS_KNG005	Use the Earth Vellumental!
BtlAudience_BOSS_KNG006	Use a Magic Circle!
BtlAudience_BOSS_KNG007	Put this sucker out!
BtlAudience_BOSS_KNG008	Now! Magic Circle, ACTIVATE!
BtlAudience_BOSS_KNG009	Hose that bird down!
BtlAudience_BOSS_KNG010	Crush that ice!
BtlAudience_BOSS_KNG011	Turn up the heat!
BtlAudience_BOSS_KNG012	Such dangerous attacks...
battle_Tutorial.msbt
BtlTutorial_001	Oh no! I'm guessing this is your first\ntime facing Folded Soldiers, Mario...\x0e\0\x04\0Once these flat paper folks have\nbeen turned into Folded Soldiers,\nwe can't turn them back!\x0e\0\x04\0It seems cruel to fight them, but if\nwe don't, they'll try to fold you into\norigami too!\x0e\0\x04\0I'd help you attack, but my tiny\narms don't pack much of a punch.\nI don't want to get in your way...\x0e\0\x04\0So I'll cheer you on, but you'll have\nto do the heavy lifting yourself!
BtlTutorial_002_02	And hey, did you catch that first\nmessage? It said something about\na "WAVE BATTLE!" Are we in some\nkind of splash zone?\x0e\0\x04\0I guess we'll worry about that when\nwe get to it. Let's just focus on\nthese enemies for now, Mario.
BtlTutorial_002_10	Speaking of, you're surrounded by\nFOUR Folded Soldiers! Huh. Where\ndid the other three come from?\x0e\0\x04\0If they all attack at once, you'll get\na real pummeling. This looks rough...
BtlTutorial_002_11	Hey! I just had a great idea!\x0e\0\x04\0If you line all four of them up, you\ncould jump your way down the row\nin one attack! Bop, boop, bip, bam!
BtlTutorial_002_01	Lucky for us, these rings will let us\nmove the enemies around and group\nthem together!\x0e\0\x04\0So! Use  to select which ring you\nwant to move, and then press  to\nconfirm your choice.\x0e\0\x04\0There's just one naughty Goomba\nout of place right now. Let's try and\nget it over to that empty {c[cf2c12]}〇{c[404040]}.
BtlTutorial_002_09	Remember, you want to get that\none tricky Goomba back in line\nwith the others.\x0e\0\x04\0So select the ring you want to move\nwith , then press  to confirm!
BtlTutorial_002_05	Now, use  again to rotate the ring.\nOnce that Goomba is lined up with\nthe others, press  to finish.
BtlTutorial_002_06	Remember, you want to select a\nring to move with , then press \nto confirm.
BtlTutorial_002_08	Oops. That's not the ring I was\ntalking about.\x0e\0\x04\0You need to move the ring that one\nstray Goomba is standing on!
BtlTutorial_002_03	Hmm...is that right? It doesn't look\nlined up to me. 
BtlTutorial_002_07	Aww! Time ran out!\x0e\0\x04\0This may seem tricky at first, but I\nknow you'll get the hang of it!
BtlTutorial_002_04	Yeah! There we go! You lined up all\nfour Goombas!\x0e\0\x04\0When you group your enemies into\na {c[cf2c12]}successful lineup{c[404040]} like this, your\nattack power increases by 1.5\xd7!\x0e\0\x04\0That means your attack power will\nbe precisely, uh...oh, gosh. I forgot\nhow to multiply by a point. Um...\x0e\0\x04\0Oh whatever! You get what I mean.\nYour attacks will do more damage!\x0e\0\x04\0So...keep lining up those enemies!
BtlTutorial_003_02	OK, now we can flatten these\nGoombas with a jump attack!\x0e\0\x04\0Select your pair of {c[cf2c12]}boots {c[404040]}using ,\nthen press  to begin your attack.
BtlTutorial_004_01	But...I want to see your jump attack.\nWill you pick the {c[cf2c12]}boots{c[404040]}? Please?
BtlTutorial_004_02	Whoops! I think you selected the\nwrong row.\x0e\0\x04\0Let's try again. Tilt left or right\non  to select a row, then tilt up\nor down on  to select your attack.
BtlTutorial_005	Wow! Those world-famous Mario\njumps don't disappoint!\x0e\0\x04\0You took out all four Goombas with\na single jump attack!\x0e\0\x04\0See what I mean? Lining up your\nenemies is totally worth the effort!
BtlTutorial_005_01	Argh! More Folded Soldiers?!\x0e\0\x04\0I guess some battles are gonna have\nenemies attacking in waves...\x0e\0\x04\0Oh! I guess that must be why this\nwas called a {c[cf2c12]}wave battle {c[404040]}up front!\x0e\0\x04\0If you see "last wave" pop up, that\nmust mean you're on the last group.\nHang tough, Mario!
BtlTutorial_006	These guys are lined up a little\ndifferently, so show me your\nhammer attack next!
BtlTutorial_007	Your hammer will hit a shorter, wider\narea with one powerful blow.
BtlTutorial_007_01	Those spaces marked with {c[cf2c12]}〇 {c[404040]}are\nshowing you where your hammer\nattack will land.\x0e\0\x04\0It'd be great if you could get all four\nFolded Soldiers onto those spaces...\x0e\0\x04\0Let's give it a try, same as before!\nSelect a ring using , then press\n to confirm.
BtlTutorial_009_01	Hm. I don't think you've got them\nin the right spots.\x0e\0\x04\0You want to group them together\non the red rings so you can hit 'em\nall with one hammer attack!
BtlTutorial_009	You did it! Now they're all in\nhammerin' range!\x0e\0\x04\0And they're lined up perfectly, so\nyour attack power went up by 1.5\xd7!\nI'll, uh, let you do that math.
BtlTutorial_015	Oh, hey! That'll work!\x0e\0\x04\0They're not on the red circles, but\nthey're all in range of your hammer!\x0e\0\x04\0And they're lined up perfectly, so\nyour attack power went up by 1.5\xd7!\nI'll, uh, let you do that math.
BtlTutorial_010	Time to swing that hammer of yours!\x0e\0\x04\0Use  to select your {c[cf2c12]}hammer{c[404040]}, then\npress  to start your attack.
BtlTutorial_011	Aw, c'mon! Show me the {c[cf2c12]}hammer{c[404040]},\nMario! Pleeease?
BtlTutorial_012	Whoops! You selected the wrong\narea for your attack.\x0e\0\x04\0Tilt left or right on  to select an\nattack range, then tilt up or down\non  to select your attack.
BtlTutorial_016	Uh...Mario? That attack range will\nonly hit half of the enemies. You\nwant to smack all four at once!\x0e\0\x04\0Tilt left or right on  to select an\nattack range, then tilt up or down\non  to select your attack.
BtlTutorial_013	Did you see that?! BLOP! Ahhh,\nwhat a satisfying attack.\x0e\0\x04\0Fast, flashy, and flattening—but\nonly if you arrange your enemies\ninto a {c[cf2c12]}successful lineup{c[404040]}.\x0e\0\x04\0Jump attacks and hammer attacks\nboth have their own ideal lineups.\x0e\0\x04\0Always think carefully about how\nyour enemies are lined up before\nyou attack, OK? OK!
BtlTutorial2_001	Whoa...it's been a while since that\nfirst battle, hasn't it?\x0e\0\x04\0I think I remember how everything\nworks... Do you? Let's give it a shot!
BtlTutorial2_002_02	All right, this seems familiar.\nYou're gonna line these Folded\nSoldiers up, remember?
BtlTutorial2_002_01	These Goombas look like they can\nbe arranged into a single line.\x0e\0\x04\0Remember how to move the rings?\nYou just, uh...hmm. I'll let you figure\nit out.
BtlTutorial2_002_01_MISS	Remember, you want to rotate the\nrings so that the Goombas are all\nlined up in the {c[cf2c12]}〇 {c[404040]}spots.
BtlTutorial2_002_03	Hey, so you're a bit rusty from\nthe last battle. No problem!\x0e\0\x04\0Let's take it from the top, shall we?
BtlTutorial2_002_04	You got them all lined up! Nice work,\nMario! If you can do this every time,\nyou'll be good to go.
BtlTutorial2_003_02	OK! Next! Which attack works best\non a lineup like this?
BtlTutorial2_003_02_AC	Yep! When they're in a straight line,\nyou can use your boots to jump on\nall of them in a row.\x0e\0\x04\0And since you nailed that lineup,\nyour attack power went up by 1.5\xd7!\x0e\0\x04\0Oh, hey! That reminds me...you know\nabout {c[cf2c12]}action commands{c[404040]}, right?{c[404040]}\x0e\0\x04\0{c[404040]}If you press {c[404040]} just as you land on\nan enemy, you'll deal more damage!\x0e\0\x04\0Let's give it a try! Get ready...{c[404040]}\n{c[8aae3b]}(Press  as soon as it appears!){c[404040]}
BtlTutorial2_004_01	I don't think that attack will take\nout a full row of enemies like this...\x0e\0\x04\0Select your {c[cf2c12]}boots{c[404040]} with , then\npress  to begin the attack!
BtlTutorial2_004_02	If you don't place the enemies\nwithin attack range, you won't\nbe able to hit them all!\x0e\0\x04\0Try targeting those Goombas again.
BtlTutorial2_005	Yes! A perfectly lined-up jump\nattack is soooo satisfying.\x0e\0\x04\0If you can land multiple action\ncommands during battles, you'll\ntake your enemies out in no time!
BtlTutorial2_005_01	Ack! Another wave of Folded Soldiers\ncame out of nowhere!
BtlTutorial2_007_01	Huh. They're spread out a bit\ndifferently this time, aren't they?\x0e\0\x04\0We need to line them up a certain\nway... You know what to do, right?
BtlTutorial2_009_01	Oh no! The enemies aren't\nquite lined up...\x0e\0\x04\0You won't be able to defeat the\nenemies in one move if they aren't\nall in attack range. Try again!
BtlTutorial2_009_02	Oops. That's not quite right...\x0e\0\x04\0Try to arrange the enemies so\nthey're all within attack range.\nGive it another shot!
BtlTutorial2_009	They're all in the perfect position!\nNice work, Mario! You're such a pro.
BtlTutorial2_015	Oh! OK! That placement should still\nwork great. Nicely done! 
BtlTutorial2_010	Now you can use a weapon to\nflatten all of the Goombas at once!
BtlTutorial2_010_AC	Yes! Now that they're placed close\ntogether, these enemies don't stand\na chance.\x0e\0\x04\0And I have even more good news!\nYou can use action commands with\nthe hammer too!\x0e\0\x04\0You'll see a burst behind you as you\nwind up your swing. Press  when\nthat burst flashes brightest!\x0e\0\x04\0Ready to give it a try? Here we go...\n{c[8aae3b]}(Press  as soon as it appears!){c[404040]}
BtlTutorial2_011	Jumps won't do much when enemies\nare bunched up like that. Select the\n{c[cf2c12]}hammer {c[404040]}with  and attack with !
BtlTutorial2_012	If you don't aim carefully at your\nenemies, you won't be able to\nattack. Aim for the Goombas!
BtlTutorial2_016	Make sure you aim carefully to hit\nas many enemies as possible with\neach attack!\x0e\0\x04\0Try again...and aim for all\nof the Goombas this time!
BtlTutorial2_013	Ahhh, that was a thing of beauty.\nYou smashed all four Goombas with\na single swing!\x0e\0\x04\0There's one other, super-important\nkind of action command...\x0e\0\x04\0When enemies are attacking YOU,\npress  just before you get hit to\nguard and take less damage!\x0e\0\x04\0Go get 'em, Mario! Keep lining up\nenemies and using action commands!
BtlTutorial3_002_01	Look! More puny little Goombas.\nThis'll be a piece of cake.\x0e\0\x04\0Line 'em up, and take 'em out\nwith a quick jump attack.
BtlTutorial3_002_02	Wait. Something's wrong...\x0e\0\x04\0No matter which ring you turn,\nthat one Goomba won't fall in line!\x0e\0\x04\0I'm getting dizzy... Let's stop\nrotating those rings and think\nabout this.\x0e\0\x04\0I think there's some other way to\nmove enemies around...
BtlTutorial3_002_03	It's...slipping! No. Wait. Sloughing?\nStriding? Line dancing?{c[404040]}\x0e\0\x04\0Oh, I remember! It's {c[cf2c12]}sliding{c[404040]}! You can\nrotate each of the rings, but you\ncan also SLIDE the panels in a row!{c[404040]}
BtlTutorial3_003_01	First, press / to switch\nfrom rotating to sliding.
BtlTutorial3_003_01_02	There you go! Your area of control\nhas changed from a ring to a row.\nNow we're ready to slide!\x0e\0\x04\0Use  to select the row you want\nto slide, then press  to confirm!
BtlTutorial3_003_02	Oops. You're still spinning the rings,\nMario. We need to slide a row!
BtlTutorial3_003_03	Whoops. Wrong row! We need to\nselect the one with the enemies.
BtlTutorial3_003_04	OK! It's time to slide! Let's get\nthese Goombas lined up.\x0e\0\x04\0Use  to slide the panels up and\ndown. When you're done, press \nto confirm and lock them in place!
BtlTutorial3_004_02	Hmm! They're still not perfectly\nlined up. Try to slide them again!
BtlTutorial3_004_03	That's it! Now they're all lined up!
BtlTutorial3_005_01	Now you just need to attack\nlike normal!
BtlTutorial3_005_02	You won't take out the whole row\nthat way. Use  to select your\n{c[cf2c12]}boots{c[404040]}, then use  to attack!
BtlTutorial3_005_03	If you aren't careful with your aim,\nyou won't be able to attack.\nAim for those Goombas!
BtlTutorial3_006_01	Looks like rotating the rings won't\ndo the trick in this last wave...\x0e\0\x04\0Let's try sliding the panels\ninto place again!
BtlExp_MagicCircleON_1	Hmm...that Magic Circle doesn't look\nlike it has any power. Is it on break?
BtlExp_MagicCircleON_2	Wait! What's that? This is the first\ntime we've seen a panel like that...\x0e\0\x04\0It looks kind of like a switch.\nMaybe it activates something!
Btl_Tuto_2Ring_01	Oh no! The Folded Soldiers are\nspread out all over the place!
Btl_Tuto_2Ring_01_02	There's no way you can line them\nup in a single move!\x0e\0\x04\0We'll be crumpled before our\nadventure has even begun.\nThat's just mean!
Btl_Tuto_2Ring_02	Wait! Do you see that? It says \xd72\nunder Ring Moves...\x0e\0\x04\0It looks like you'll get TWO chances\nto move the rings in one turn!\x0e\0\x04\0If some battles will let us move the\nrings twice, that changes things!\x0e\0\x04\0OK! Let's think. You could start by,\nuh, moving that one...then...hmm.\x0e\0\x04\0I'll leave the rings to you, Mario!\nGo get 'em!
Btl_Tuto_2Command_01	Whoa! There are a lot more\nFolded Soldiers this time.
Btl_Tuto_2Command_01_02	We'll never hit all of these enemies\nwith a single attack...\x0e\0\x04\0Is this the end? Is this really our\nfinal battle?! It's been an honor\nto fight alongside you, Mario...
Btl_Tuto_2Command_02	Oh! Look, Mario! The action section!\x0e\0\x04\0Does that mean we get TWO attacks\nin this one turn?\x0e\0\x04\0Let's find out. Try selecting your\nfirst attack now!
Btl_Tuto_2Command_03	Yes! I knew it! You've still got\none action remaining!\x0e\0\x04\0Pick your second attack, Mario!
Btl_Tuto_2Command_04	Wow! With two actions, you're\nalmost unstoppable!\x0e\0\x04\0With a successful lineup and\nmultiple actions, we can take out\na TON of enemies in a single turn!\x0e\0\x04\0Always check your remaining actions\nbefore you choose your attacks!
Btl_Tuto_CoinTimer_01	Hwoof. That countdown timer just\nGOES, doesn't it? It makes the\nlineup phase so stressful...\x0e\0\x04\0Ooh! Hey! It looks like you can press\nand hold  to spend coins and add\nmore time to the countdown clock!\x0e\0\x04\0I bet you can press  for a looooong\ntime, but it'll cost you a lot of coins.\x0e\0\x04\0So don't overuse it! Time is coins!
Btl_Tuto_Kinopio_01	It's great to have the Toads we\nrescued cheering for us from the\nbleachers. They seem excited!\x0e\0\x04\0Y'know what would make them even\nMORE excited? Getting PAID!\x0e\0\x04\0If you have coins to spare, hold \nto toss some out to the Toads.\nI'm sure they'll pitch in somehow!
Btl_Tuto_Kinopio_03	Is it just me, or is it getting much\nmore difficult to line up all these\nFolded Soldiers?\x0e\0\x04\0If it ever feels totally impossible, try\nholding  to get the audience of\nToads to help by {c[cf2c12]}cheering you on{c[404040]}!
Btl_Tuto_Kinopio_02	Ooh! Check it out, Mario! The Toads\njust revealed all kinds of cool stuff!
Btl_Tuto_Kinopio_04	Wow! Are those dots on the ground\nshowing us where our current path\nwill take us?\x0e\0\x04\0And that triangle must be showing\nus where we'll end up! GO, TOADS!
Btl_Tuto_GodHand_01	Wait! Let me say one quick thing...\x0e\0\x04\0Be aware of your surroundings, and\nplease don't shake your controller\ntoo wildly!
Btl_Tuto_RouteMiss_01	Oof! You OK, Mario? Remember to\nend your route on an Action Panel\nor you won't be able to attack!
Btl_Tuto_RouteMiss_02	Yikes! You need to place an Arrow\nPanel in front of you, Mario. If you\ndon't, you'll trip on the first step!
Btl_Tuto_Zako_MagicCircle_01	Hey! Give that Magic Circle back!\nYou can't even use it!\x0e\0\x04\0If they won't give it back, you'll\njust have to take it back, Mario!
BtlAC_Help_Slow	Too late!
BtlAC_Help_Fast	Too soon!
BtlAC_Help_Near	So close!
BtlAC_Help_Just	Perfect!
battle_W1C3.msbt
W1C3_EarthGod_Enter_01	Wow! This Vellumental looks just\nas powerful as I hoped it would!\x0e\0\x04\0That shell looks SUPER sturdy.\nIts body must be well protected...\x0e\0\x04\0Makes those little legs look kind of\nvulnerable, doesn't it?
W1C3_EarthGod_NoDamage_01	That shell is too hard. Your jumps\naren't even making a dent!\x0e\0\x04\0We should try aiming somewhere\na bit less protected.
W1C3_EarthGod_Charge_01	Whoa! What's up with the\nEarth Vellumental?\x0e\0\x04\0Its legs are tucked inside. This might\nbe our chance to try a cool move!
W1C3_EarthGod_Charge_02	Looks like the Earth Vellumental is\ngetting really worked up!\x0e\0\x04\0Its limbs aren't exposed...but that\nmeans it can't move! Let's grab\nthis opportunity while we can!
W1C3_EarthGod_GodHand_02	Now, Mario! Give it all you've got!
W1C3_EarthGod_GodHand_NG_01	Oh no! It managed to shrug off\nthe 1,000-Fold Arms!\x0e\0\x04\0We have to get it to tuck back into\nits shell so we can grab it. If we did\nit once, we can do it again!
W1C3_EarthGod_Return_01	Huh?
W1C3_EarthGod_Return_02	Whaaat?! The Earth Vellumental\nbounced back from THAT?\x0e\0\x04\0Don't give up! If one rush attack\ndidn't do the trick, we'll just have\nto give it another try!
W1C3_EarthGod_Dead_01	YES! You did it, Mario!
W1C3_EarthGod_Tutorial_17	Would you like me to explain\nhow boss battles work?\x0e\x01\x04\x14\n\0y\0e\0s\0n\0o\0\x01\0\0\0\x01\0\0\0
W1C3_EarthGod_Tutorial_01	Oh, hey! This is our first boss battle!\nI've been itching to try one of these.\x0e\0\x04\0The Earth Vellumental is in the\ncenter this time. Your attacks\nwon't reach from way out here.\x0e\0\x04\0You'll have to get closer...but it\nlooks like something weird has\nhappened to the rings.\x0e\0\x04\0And what's up with those arrows\nscattered all over? Should we...\nfollow them?
W1C3_EarthGod_Tutorial_02	Let's give it a shot! If my hunch\nis right, we'll need to start with...\nthe start.\x0e\0\x04\0Let's try to place one of the arrows\non the space in front of you.
W1C3_EarthGod_Tutorial_02_RING	Looks like you can select and move\nthe rings just like regular battles.\x0e\0\x04\0Select the outer ring so we can\nplace this arrow under the red {c[cf2c12]}〇{c[404040]}\non your starting space.
W1C3_EarthGod_Tutorial_03	Oops! That's not the right ring.
W1C3_EarthGod_Tutorial_03_SLIDE	Ooh! Getting fancy, are we?\nI like your style, Mario, but this\nis more of a "rotate" situation.
W1C3_EarthGod_Tutorial_03_TIME	Oh, right! The timer! I guess we still\nhave to worry about that. Let's try\nagain and quickly this time!
W1C3_EarthGod_Tutorial_04	Bingo! That's the ring!\x0e\0\x04\0Now rotate it until the arrow is\nunder the {c[cf2c12]}〇{c[404040]}, and our first move\nwill be in place.
W1C3_EarthGod_Tutorial_05	If the arrow isn't under the {c[cf2c12]}〇{c[404040]}, we\nwon't be able to take our first step!\x0e\0\x04\0Let's try again!
W1C3_EarthGod_Tutorial_06	Aw, shoot! Time's up!\x0e\0\x04\0If you don't place an arrow under\nthe {c[cf2c12]}〇 {c[404040]}and commit it with  before\nthe clock runs out, we won't get far.\x0e\0\x04\0Let's try again!
W1C3_EarthGod_Tutorial_07	Yeah! My hunch WAS right!\x0e\0\x04\0OK, so...once you step on an arrow,\nyou'll keep moving in that direction\nuntil you step on ANOTHER arrow.\x0e\0\x04\0If we keep that in mind, we'll be able\nto create a path that puts us right\nin front of the Earth Vellumental!
W1C3_EarthGod_Tutorial_07_AFTER	Oh! The arrows are already leading\nus to the Earth Vellumental. Hmm.\x0e\0\x04\0I guess getting to the right spot is\nonly half the job. What's next?
W1C3_EarthGod_Tutorial_08	Ooh! That panel must be your way\nto attack!\x0e\0\x04\0Try placing that {c[cf2c12]}Action Panel {c[404040]}under\nthe {c[cf2c12]}〇{c[404040]}, and see what happens.
W1C3_EarthGod_Tutorial_10	That's it! Now spin the ring,\nand place that Action Panel\nunder the {c[cf2c12]}〇{c[404040]}.
W1C3_EarthGod_Tutorial_11	If you don't bring the Action Panel\nto the {c[cf2c12]}〇{c[404040]}, you won't be able to do\nanything at the end of your turn.\x0e\0\x04\0Let's back up and try this again.
W1C3_EarthGod_Tutorial_12	Way to go, Mario! You made it to\nthe Earth Vellumental!\x0e\0\x04\0Now it's time to attack! Let's see...\x0e\0\x04\0Different attacks are probably going\nto affect different areas.\x0e\0\x04\0Try to aim your attack at an area\nwhere it won't bounce right off!
W1C3_EarthGod_Tutorial_12_ATK	Yes! You would have bounced right\noff that hard shell, but attacking its\nleg seemed to be pretty effective!
W1C3_EarthGod_Tutorial_12_ATK_JUMP	Whoops! Looks like jumping won't\nmake a dent on that hard shell.\x0e\0\x04\0Try your hammer! See if you can\naim somewhere more vulnerable...
W1C3_EarthGod_Tutorial_12_ATK_MISS	You have to attack, Mario! If you\ndon't, the Earth Vellumental will\nremain under my brother's control...
W1C3_EarthGod_Tutorial_12_ATK_MISS_00	Oh no. I think the Earth Vellumental\nis winding up for an attack! Try to\nguard against it at the right time!
W1C3_EarthGod_Tutorial_GuardAC	Press  just before the attack hits\nto guard. Aah! Here it comes!
W1C3_EarthGod_Tutorial_GuardAC_Success	Phew! You took less damage!\nGood thing too. That looked like\nit hurt even WITH the guarding...
W1C3_EarthGod_Tutorial_GuardAC_Success_02	That's it, Mario! You still took some\ndamage...but it could have been a\nlot worse!
W1C3_EarthGod_Tutorial_GuardAC_Failure	Oof! That looked like it hurt...\nTime your blocks! Defense is\njust as important as offense!
W1C3_EarthGod_Tutorial_13	OK! What's next, what's next...\x0e\0\x04\0Why not aim for its right front leg?
W1C3_EarthGod_Tutorial_13_AFTER	Just line up the arrows and place\nan Action Panel under the {c[cf2c12]}〇{c[404040]}.\x0e\0\x04\0Hmm. That outer ring probably goes\nover there, then the inner one, uh...\x0e\0\x04\0I'm already lost. I'll leave this\none up to you, Mario!
W1C3_EarthGod_Tutorial_14	Aw! Nice try. Give it another shot!
W1C3_EarthGod_Tutorial_15	Nicely done, Mario!\nNext, choose an attack!
W1C3_EarthGod_Tutorial_15_SUB	Oh, bravo! This isn't what I had\nin mind, but it'll do the trick!
W1C3_EarthGod_Tutorial_15_ATK	Yeah! Just like that!
W1C3_EarthGod_Tutorial_16	Looks like you've got the\nhang of boss battles.\x0e\0\x04\0Remember to think about timing\nand targeting your attacks!\x0e\0\x04\0Those other panels look interesting\ntoo. You should see what happens\nwhen you walk over them!\x0e\0\x04\0Now let's go win us a\nboss fight, Mario!
W1C3_EarthGod_Tutorial_Circle	Ooh! OOH! Is that— It is! It's a\n{c[cf2c12]}1,000-Fold Arms Magic Circle{c[404040]}!\x0e\0\x04\0If you can get to that Magic Circle,\nI can activate the 1,000-Fold Arms!\x0e\0\x04\0It probably works the same way as\n{c[404040]}Action Panels, so try to place it at\nthe end of your route!{c[404040]}
W1C3_EarthGod_Tutorial_WeakPoint	Whoa! Its tail must be\nSUPER tender!
W1C3_EarthGod_BuddyTalk_01	It's OK! Stay calm!\nJust focus on the arrows.
W1C3_EarthGod_BuddyTalk_04	Why don't we try attacking\none of its soft spots?
W1C3_EarthGod_BuddyTalk_05	This seems like a good time to\ntry the Magic Circle!
W1C3_EarthGod_ChestHelp_01	The Earth Vellumental's shell is\nsuper sturdy. Jump attacks will\nalways bounce right off of it.\x0e\0\x04\0Aim for its exposed limbs instead.\nGet up close and personal with\nyour hammer!
W1C3_EarthGod_ChestHelp_02	The Earth Vellumental's tail is its\nweak spot. A successful hit will\nmake it fully retract into its shell!
W1C3_EarthGod_ChestHelp_03	When it's retreated into its shell,\nthat's your chance to flip it over\nwith the 1,000-Fold Arms!
W1C3_EarthGod_RetryHelp_Normal	The Earth Vellumental is tough,\nbut it has to have a weak spot...\x0e\0\x04\0What about that cute, wiggly tail?
W1C3_EarthGod_RetryHelp_Charge	The Earth Vellumental sure is scary\nwhen it's preparing its big attack...\x0e\0\x04\0But we have an ace up our sleeve—\nboth sleeves, in fact! Let's try the\n1,000-Fold Arms!
W1C3_EarthGod_GodHand_Help_01	{s[080]}\x0e\x01\x03\x04\0\0\0\0Grab the Earth Vellumental!\x0e\x01\x01\0{s[100]}
W1C3_EarthGod_GodHand_Help_02	{s[080]}\x0e\x01\x03\x04\0\0\0\0Grab the Earth Vellumental\nand flip it!\x0e\x01\x01\0{s[100]}

W2C2_WaterGod_GodHand_Failure_01	Argh! We can't even catch it by the\ntail! Why is the Water Vellumental\nso slippery?! Hmm. Silly question.
W2C2_WaterGod_Charge_01	Huh. Does the Water Vellumental\nlook a little waterlogged to you?\x0e\0\x04\0It soaked that water up like a\nsponge...a super-strong, super-\ndeadly sponge!
W2C2_WaterGod_Charge_02	The Water Vellumental's belly looks\nfit to burst!\x0e\0\x04\0It's getting ready for something big,\nMario... Brace yourself!
W2C2_WaterGod_Charge_03	Look at its belly! It's ready to\nburst again...and I don't think\nit'll hold back!\x0e\0\x04\0If you don't find shelter,\nthis might be really bad!
W2C2_WaterGod_Earth_02	Whoa! Slick move, Mario! Rising up\nand out of the way just saved us.\nThanks, Earth Vellumental!
W2C2_WaterGod_Earth_03	*pant pant*\nTh-that wave was HUGE!\x0e\0\x04\0I doubt that was a one-off. We need\nto find a way to defend ourselves\nbefore that happens again!
W2C2_WaterGod_Weak_01	Aha! That attack really wore\nthe Water Vellumental out.\nNow's our chance!
W2C2_WaterGod_BuddyTalk_01	Those waterspouts next to the\nWater Vellumental look like trouble.\x0e\0\x04\0Keep an eye on them, Mario!
W2C2_WaterGod_BuddyTalk_Fly_01	Careful! The Water Vellumental\nis airborne again. Your hammer\nwon't reach!
W2C2_WaterGod_BuddyTalk_Ground_01	Ah! The Water Vellumental is right\nin front of you! You can probably\nsmack it with your hammer now!
W2C2_WaterGod_BuddyTalk_Charge_01	The Water Vellumental's all\npuffed up...\x0e\0\x04\0I have a bad feeling about this.\nGet to a safe, high place! Hurry!
W2C2_WaterGod_BuddyTalk_Weakness_01	The Water Vellumental is all\nwashed up! Now's your chance!
W2C2_WaterGod_ChestHelp_01	When the Water Vellumental takes\nflight, bring it down with a jump,\nthen follow up with your hammer!
W2C2_WaterGod_ChestHelp_02	When the Water Vellumental's belly\nis full, it'll unleash a powerful wave!\x0e\0\x04\0Use the Earth Vellumental's power\nto stay high and dry!
W2C2_WaterGod_ChestHelp_03	The best time to strike with your\n1,000-Fold Arms attack is right after\none of the Vellumental's waves!
W2C2_WaterGod_RetryHelp_01	This is gonna be a water battle...\nso the panels on the rings might\nget washed away.\x0e\0\x04\0Stay on your guard, Mario. If it looks\nlike the tide is about to turn against\nus, you'll need to be ready!
W2C2_WaterGod_RetryHelp_02	The Water Vellumental is probably\ngoing to shoot a ton of water at us,\nright? I don't want to get flooded!\x0e\0\x04\0We'll need higher ground! Maybe the\npower of the Earth Vellumental can\nhelp us avoid the waves...

W2C5_Boss_Enter_01	Behold the POWER of my rubber\nbands! Let's see how well you\ntake stage direction, ha ha!
W2C5_Boss_Enter_02	Hey! You can't just flick the panels\naway! We need those!
W2C5_Boss_Enter_03	What the— Now there are rubber\nbands all over the arena! 
W2C5_Boss_NoDamage_06	♪Ooh, your PITIFUL attacks have\nno effect on my BOUNCY body!♪
W2C5_Boss_NoDamage_03	Oh no! It summoned those loose\nrubber bands back to its weird,\nwobbly body! What do we do now?!
W2C5_Boss_NoDamage_04	Normal attacks aren't working!\nThere must be a better way to\nHAND-le this battle...right?\nSome way to ARM ourselves?
W2C5_Boss_NoDamage_05	Normal attacks won't have any\neffect on that rubbery body! Isn't\nthere some way we can gain the\nupper HAND?
W2C5_Boss_Attack_01	Prepare yourselves! Here comes\nmy Rubber Bind attack!
W2C5_Boss_Attack_02	Argh! Those rubber bands had you\nall tied up! Is it possible to guard\nagainst them?
W2C5_Boss_GodHand_01	OW! HEY! Don't YANK on my\nbands like that! That's no way\nto treat a STAR!
W2C5_Boss_GodHand_02	Look! Some of its bands are missing.\nIt couldn't summon all of them back!
W2C5_Boss_Final_01	Eww! It's all wobbly and wriggly!
W2C5_Boss_Final_02	The curtain's been pulled back!\nI've been EXPOSED!\x0e\0\x04\0You've reduced my ensemble to a\none-man band! You'll PAY for that!
W2C5_Boss_RouteHint_01	Huh? There are no arrows pointing\nto the center!\x0e\0\x04\0I guess we could try bumping into\none of those rubber-band tiles...\nThat's crazy enough to work, right?
W2C5_Boss_BuddyTalk_07	We'll never get to the center of the\narena like this...\x0e\0\x04\0Maybe we should try bumping into\none of those rubber bands. Who\nknows? They might actually help!
W2C5_Boss_BuddyTalk_08	Hmmm. I have a feeling normal\nattacks won't make a dent on that\nthing's bouncy, rubbery body!
W2C5_Boss_BuddyTalk_09	What if we yank the bands up top\nand snap 'em nice and hard? We'll\nneed a good, STRONG grip...
W2C5_Boss_BuddyTalk_10	It's so floppy and bouncy! Normal\nattacks don't have any effect!
W2C5_Boss_BuddyTalk_11	Now! Use the 1,000-Fold Arms to yank\nit back and snap it REAL hard!
W2C5_Boss_BuddyTalk_12	It's wriggling so fast! Try to watch\nits movements real close, then time\nyour attack just right!
W2C5_Boss_Hint_01	Be bold! Try bumping against one of\nthose rubber-band panels!
W2C5_Boss_Hint_02	Normal attacks have no effect on\nthis Rubber Band. Use your 1,000-\nFold Arms to yank at it instead!
W2C5_Boss_Hint_03	Get close to the enemy before using\nthe 1,000-Fold Arms. The closer you\nare, the more bands you'll grab.\x0e\0\x04\0Yank those rubber bands back as\nfar as you can, then let 'em fly!
W2C5_Boss_Hint_09	Watch the Rubber Band's movements\ncarefully as you try to grab it! You'll\nhave to time it juuust right...
W2C5_Boss_GodHand_Help_06	{s[080]}\x0e\x01\x03\x04\0\0\0\0Grab the Rubber Band!\x0e\x01\x01\0{s[100]}

W2C5_Boss_RetryHelp_02	Argh! Its body is so rubbery!\nNormal attacks aren't going\nto cut it here...
W2C5_Boss_RetryHelp_03	Once it starts that super-fast,\nsuper-floppy dance, it's bound\nto tire itself out...right?
battle_W3C3.msbt
W3C3_FireGod_Enter_01	Wow! Look at this thing! Its wings\nare huuuuuge! A majestic bird like\nthis HAS to be a Vellumental.\x0e\0\x04\0And it's on fire! Totally fitting for a\nFire Vellumental.\x0e\0\x04\0So...what should we do first, Mario?
W3C3_FireGod_Shou_01	Ooh, watch your route! Those fiery\nfeathers all over the rings look \ndangerous...
W3C3_FireGod_Shou_10	Did you see that? Its HP went\ndown when it lost those feathers!\x0e\0\x04\0I bet it'd be really weak if it lost\nall of its feathers. But also kind\nof sad.
W3C3_FireGod_Shou_02	Alert! Warning! Awooooga!\x0e\0\x04\0There are a LOT of burning feathers\non the rings. You'd better extinguish\nthem before it's too late!
W3C3_FireGod_Shou_03	Yes! Water puts out fires! I probably\ndidn't need to explain that, huh?\x0e\0\x04\0Well, if this Vellumental's fire is\nout, you might be able to attack\nit without getting burned!
W3C3_FireGod_Shou_04	That fire burned right through your\nboots! Do you have a sturdier pair\nthat might withstand the heat?
W3C3_FireGod_Shou_11	Mario! I feel like this should be\nobvious, but...don't touch the fire!\nNot even with the 1,000-Fold Arms!
W3C3_FireGod_Shou_07	Hey! That attack should've knocked\nthose last few feathers off its head!\nWhy didn't it work?\x0e\0\x04\0It is a really cool hairdo...but we\nneed to pluck this bird bald!\x0e\0\x04\0Do we have some other way to\nHAND-le those last few feathers?
W3C3_FireGod_Shou_08	Uh-oh. I'm NOT a fan of whatever\nthis is. It looks like it's gearing up\nfor something big!\x0e\0\x04\0I'm not sure of the best way to\nHAND-le this, but you'd better\nARM yourself in a hurry!
W3C3_FireGod_Shou_09	Uh-oh. I'm NOT a fan of whatever\nthis is. It looks like it's gearing up\nfor something big!\x0e\0\x04\0Whatever you're gonna do...do it\nin a hurry. But first you better\nput out those flames!
W3C3_FireGod_Shou_14	Whaaaat?! The Fire Vellumental\njust brushed your attack off like\nit was nothing!\x0e\0\x04\0The timing felt right... There must be\na better way to HAND-le our attack\nin that moment!
W3C3_FireGod_Shou_15	Not again! Argh!\nDoes this ever end?!\x0e\0\x04\0Let's make this next attack count.\nI know you'll HAND-le it somehow!
W3C3_FireGod_Shou_16	It rekindled itself?! No way!\x0e\0\x04\0Maybe we need to time your\n1,000-Fold Arms attack better...
W3C3_FireGod_Shou_17	It came back! AGAIN! We're gonna\nhave to get ALL of its feathers off\nat once or it'll just unpluck itself!
W3C3_FireGod_BuddyTalk_07	Better avoid those fiery feathers.\nIf you bump into one, you'll get fried!
W3C3_FireGod_BuddyTalk_08	There are too many burning feathers\nout here! Don't we have a way to\nput them all out at once? Y'know,\nlike...with water or something?
W3C3_FireGod_BuddyTalk_09	There has to be some way to land\nan attack when this thing is on fire.\nC'mon, brain! Think, think, think!
W3C3_FireGod_BuddyTalk_10	It's not on fire! That means you\ncan finally touch it! Go, Mario!
W3C3_FireGod_BuddyTalk_11	Now's your chance to land a big\nattack! I know you can gain the\nupper HAND somehow, Mario!
W3C3_FireGod_BuddyTalk_12	Aww! If it wasn't on fire, this would\nhave been a perfect chance...
W3C3_FireGod_BuddyTalk_13	This Vellumental is fired up! If you\ndon't pull the rest of its feathers out\nin one go, we might be in trouble!
W3C3_FireGod_ChestHelp_05	The 1,000-Fold Arms can't touch\nthe Fire Vellumental while it's on\nfire! Stomp it with Iron Boots!
W3C3_FireGod_ChestHelp_06	If you don't see the panels you\nneed, try opening a chest!
W3C3_FireGod_ChestHelp_01	Touch any flames on the ground\nor in the air and you'll get hurt.\nPut the fires out with water first!
W3C3_FireGod_ChestHelp_04	Its HP is linked to the number of\nfeathers it has. Use multihit jump\nattacks to pluck several at a time!
W3C3_FireGod_ChestHelp_02	The 1,000-Fold Arms won't work\nwhile it's charging in the air. Put it\nout, and ground it with water first!
W3C3_FireGod_ChestHelp_03	Grab the final feathers on its head\nwith the 1,000-Fold Arms, and yank\n'em out. If you don't, it'll heal itself!
W3C3_FireGod_ChestHelp_07	Time the 1,000-Fold Arms carefully!\nIf you don't finish it in one go, it'll\njust get angry and regenerate!
W3C3_FireGod_RetryHelp_01	Woo! Hot, hot, hot! That's definitely\nthe Fire Vellumental. It looks too\ndangerous to touch directly...\x0e\0\x04\0There's got to be some way to put\nthat fire out, right?
W3C3_FireGod_RetryHelp_02	Woo! Hot, hot, hot! That's definitely\nthe Fire Vellumental. If you try to\nstomp on it, you'll get burned!\x0e\0\x04\0If you had boots made of metal, like\niron, you might be able to avoid a\nhot foot when you jump...
W3C3_FireGod_RetryHelp_03	Wow! The Fire Vellumental's wings\nare so big and cool!\x0e\0\x04\0Those wings look like they're holding\na LOT of feathers...\x0e\0\x04\0Try an attack that will hit multiple\ntimes so we can yank out as many\nof those feathers as possible!
W3C3_FireGod_RetryHelp_04	Wow! The Fire Vellumental's wings\nare so big and cool...\x0e\0\x04\0And check out those head feathers!\nThat is one chic chicken.\x0e\0\x04\0I know it's rude to touch other\npeople's hair...but we should try!
W3C3_FireGod_GodHand_Help_03	{s[080]}\x0e\x01\x03\x04\0\0\0\0Grab the feathers\non its head!\x0e\x01\x01\0{s[100]}

W3C4_HPC_PaperTrash_01	What is that? Is that...a face?!\nWait, Mario! That's you!\x0e\0\x04\0Your punched-out face is stuck on\nthe dance floor! You'd better grab\nit, quick!
W3C4_HPC_Cover_01	Hey, hands off! Get your own duds,\nbud! I'm not through cuttin' rugs—\nor punchin' holes!
W3C4_HPC_Cover_02	Hands off! This ain't no tango!\nI'm trying to strut my stuff, and\nyou are KILLING the vibe!
W3C4_HPC_RetryHelp_01	This guy punched holes all over the\nplace! He's an enemy to paperkind!\x0e\0\x04\0Where do the cut-out pieces go\nafter it punches them out?\x0e\0\x04\0Do you think it's hiding them...\ninside its body? *shudder*
W3C4_HPC_RetryHelp_02	This Hole Punch has some serious\nmoves...but so do we!\x0e\0\x04\0That Earth Vellumental power\nisn't just for show, after all.\nWe can move the earth itself!\x0e\0\x04\0We won't let him beat us, Mario!\nLet's get out there and dance\ncircles around him!
W3C4_HPC_BuddyTalk_01	Those holes in the floor look like\ntraps. Diabolically obvious traps!\nDon't fall in them!
W3C4_HPC_BuddyTalk_02	Your max HP drops when you get\nhole punched?! That's so mean!\nGo get your pieces back, Mario!
W3C4_HPC_BuddyTalk_03	This Hole Punch must have a soft\nspot somewhere. Maybe it's hiding\na weak underbelly. Let's find out!
W3C4_HPC_BuddyTalk_04	If you hit its soft spot with your\nhammer, I bet the punched-out\npieces it's hoarding will escape!
W3C4_HPC_BuddyTalk_05	It's preparing a KILLER dance move.\nWe have to get off this dance floor!\nGet to a Magic Circle, quick!
W3C4_HPC_BuddyTalk_06	*gasp* Now's your chance! Use the\n1,000-Fold Arms to let him have it!\nWham, wham, WHAM!
W3C4_HPC_Hint_Normal_01	The Hole Punch's yellow body\nis really tough! He's hiding a\nvulnerable spot somewhere...
W3C4_HPC_Hint_Normal_02	Hit the Hole Punch's soft, gray\nlid with your hammer to send\nsome paper cutouts flying!
W3C4_HPC_Hint_Normal_03	Your max HP will drop drastically\nif you get hole punched. Reclaim\nyour cut-out pieces to restore it!

W4C2_IceGod_Enter_02	Hey! We haven't moved yet, but it's\nalready using a deep-freeze defense!\nNo fair!
W4C2_IceGod_LostChild_01	Something's off about this arena...\x0e\0\x04\0I see Magic Circles, but I don't see\nany ON panels! Where could they\nbe hiding?
W4C2_IceGod_NoDamage_01	Oooh, that ice is tough! Our attacks\naren't making a dent!
W4C2_IceGod_IceCounter_01	That ice is too slippery!\nJumping on it won't work!
W4C2_IceGod_IceCounter_02	Aah! That ice is so sharp! There has\nto be some way to get rid of it...
W4C2_IceGod_IceCounter_03	YES! How do you like THAT,\nIce Vellumental?\x0e\0\x04\0My fire may not have warmed the\nIce Vellumental's heart, but it's more\nthan enough to melt its ice!
W4C2_IceGod_IcePanel_01	Whoa! The Ice Vellumental is freezing\neverything...even the ground!
W4C2_IceGod_IcePanel_02	Careful, Mario! Icy roads ahead!\nThose frozen tiles are dangerous.
W4C2_IceGod_Icicle_01	AAH! Now it's raining chunks of ice?!\x0e\0\x04\0The Ice Vellumental has too many\ncool powers! Literally!
W4C2_IceGod_LostChild_02	Curse you, chunks of ice!\x0e\0\x04\0They won't break by spinning the\nrings around... There has to be some\nother way to break them up!
W4C2_IceGod_Icicle_02	So those chunks of ice can FREEZE\nyou? That's bad! Try to steer clear\nof them, Mario!
W4C2_IceGod_AllIce_01	YIKES! There are frozen panels all\nover the arena now!\x0e\0\x04\0The Ice Vellumental looks angry.\nWe should wrap this up before it\nloses its cool!
W4C2_IceGod_AllIce_02	Those icy patches are turning this\narena into a maze!\x0e\0\x04\0Quick, memorize the safe path to\nthat Magic Circle! Stay calm and\nfocus! STAY CALM! AAH!
W4C2_IceGod_AllIce_03	Ugh! C'mon, Ice Vellumental! Stop\njumbling up our safe path!\x0e\0\x04\0How are we supposed to remember\nthe layout for all of these rings?\nIt's impossible!
W4C2_IceGod_BuddyTalk_01	We need to thaw the Ice Vellumental\nout! It'll take more than our burning\npassion to melt through its defense.
W4C2_IceGod_BuddyTalk_02	It's finally out of the ice! Quick, try\nthe 1,000-Fold Arms while it's nice\nand vulnerable!
W4C2_IceGod_BuddyTalk_04	There has to be some way to break\nthis ice up. Have you tried sliding\nthe panels?
W4C2_IceGod_BuddyTalk_03	It keeps spinning the rings around\nto shift the maze and confuse us!\x0e\0\x04\0If you memorize the layout before\nit shifts, you can try to put the\nrings back where they belong!
W4C2_IceGod_ChestHelp_05	The ON panel is hiding in the\ntreasure chest. Release it first!
W4C2_IceGod_ChestHelp_01	Only the Fire Vellumental can melt\nthrough that icy defense! Get to\na Magic Circle and fire away!
W4C2_IceGod_ChestHelp_02	After you've melted the ice, try to\nstrike with a 1,000-Fold Arms rush\nbefore it freezes itself up again!
W4C2_IceGod_ChestHelp_03	Slide the panels in a straight row\nto break up chunks of ice. Canceling\nwill restore the ice, so think ahead!

W4C3_Boss_BuddyTalk_02	Is it just me, or is this arena REALLY\nempty? Why are there so few panels\nout here?
W4C3_Boss_BuddyTalk_03	All this tape is such a pain! With the\nright Magic Circle, we might be able\nto clear all of it with one move...

W6C2_Boss_BuddyTalk_03	You...survived? Phew! I wonder why\nit didn't do more damage...
W6C2_Boss_BuddyTalk_04	It's out of staples! Its mouth is wide\nopen... This might be our chance!
W6C2_Boss_BuddyTalk_05	It's acting strange. Something big is\ncoming... This is probably a warning!\x0e\0\x04\0We need to strong-arm this bow-wow\nbefore it bites. We can't just fold our\narms and LET it attack us...can we?
W6C2_Boss_BuddyTalk_06	Oh no... Something big is about to\nhappen! I hate it when they do this!\x0e\0\x04\0Brace yourself, Mario! Oh, if only\nI could lend you a bigger hand...
W6C2_Boss_Hint_01	Keep an eye on how many staples\nare left in its mouth, then attack\nwhile it's waiting to reload!
W6C2_Boss_Hint_02	If you're close, it'll use two staples\nto pin you down. If you're far, it'll\nfire eight staples at you!
W6C2_Boss_Hint_03	Attacking with your hammer will\nwaste one staple. A jump attack\nwill waste four!\x0e\0\x04\0Force it into its reload state\nby wasting all of its staples!
W6C2_Boss_RetryHelp_01	Yikes! This thing is really frightening!\x0e\0\x04\0Those staples are like fangs...\x0e\0\x04\0Wait a sec. What happens when this\nthing runs out of fangs?\x0e\0\x04\0That's it, Mario! If you can waste its\nstaples before it attacks, this beast\nwill be all bark and no bite!
W6C2_Boss_GodHand_Help_02	\x0e\x01\x03\x04\0\0\0\0{s[080]}Grab the Stapler!{s[100]}\x0e\x01\x01\0
W6C2_Boss_GodHand_Help_03	\x0e\x01\x03\x04\0\0\0\0{s[080]}Pry the Stapler open!{s[100]}\x0e\x01\x01\0

W6C2_Beast_01	Your adventure ends here, Mario.\x0e\0\x04\0I WILL fulfill my dream. If you won't\nfold willingly...I shall bend you to\nmy will by force!
W6C2_Beast_09	Wait, what?! That's the shape of\nthe Earth Vellumental!
W6C2_Beast_11	Indeed. I've mastered the techniques\nof every Bibliofold. Now...witness\nhow a KING wields these powers!
W6C2_Beast_12	My brother sounds excited...\nThat can't be good for us.\nBe careful, Mario!
W6C2_Beast_16	Look, Mario! It's one of those super-\nspecial Magic Circles.\x0e\0\x04\0I might be able to turn into any\nof the Vellumentals now!
W6C2_Beast_25	It looks like my brother can turn into\nany of the Vellumentals now, Mario...\x0e\0\x04\0Just remember our earlier battles!\nIf we beat them once, we can beat\nthem again!
W6C2_Beast_18	Still standing, eh? I'll soon fix that.
W6C2_Beast_17	Curses! I...I can't move!
W6C2_Beast_13	Has your memory failed you?\nThat trick won't work while\nmy legs are exposed!
W6C2_Beast_14	Ugh! He isn't going to make\nthis easy for us, is he?\x0e\0\x04\0We have to think of a way\nto stop him in his tracks!
W6C2_Beast_15	Ha! You went for my tail!\nPredictable...and disappointing.\nDid you think I wouldn't prepare?
W6C2_Beast_19	Hahaha! That attack won't\naffect me in this form!
W6C2_Beast_03	Whoa! He turned into the\nWater Vellumental!
W6C2_Beast_10	You recall the Water Vellumental's\nwaterspouts, yes? I've put my own\nspin on them!
W6C2_Beast_26	*pant, pant*\nYou...survived?! Impossible!
W6C2_Beast_21	Oh, that's right! The waterspouts\nwill wash all the panels away! Argh!
W6C2_Beast_23	Pfah! How is THAT form\nsupposed to stop me?
W6C2_Beast_27	You fool! The 1,000-Fold Arms can't\ntouch me while I'm airborne!
W6C2_Beast_05	He turned into the Fire Vellumental!
W6C2_Beast_29	No! My flames!
W6C2_Beast_30	Ha! That form won't affect\nme in the slightest!
W6C2_Beast_31	Foolish! Have you not yet learned?\nIf you play with fire, you're going to\nget burned.
W6C2_Beast_07	Waah! The Ice Vellumental!
W6C2_Beast_32	Oh no! It's the ice maze!\x0e\0\x04\0We'll have to watch the rings\ncarefully and memorize the safest\nroute! I'm so bad at this part...
W6C2_Beast_33	You melted my ice...\nVery clever!
W6C2_Beast_02	Hmph! Not bad.\nTime to switch tactics.
W6C2_Beast_04	Don't get too comfortable.\nI'm about to get serious!
W6C2_Beast_06	Ooh, you're testing my patience!\nEnough games. How about THIS?!
W6C2_Beast_28	You two haven't won yet!\nI'll crinkle you both! I swear it!
W6C2_Beast_35	What?! Did my brother's HP just\nreplenish itself?!
W6C2_Beast_36	Do you see now? You stand in a\nrealm of pure origami...and I am\nin control!\x0e\0\x04\0The longer you hesitate, the more\nI'll recover. Better think fast! Haha!
W6C2_Beast_37	You've gotta be kidding me!\nHow is that fair?!\x0e\0\x04\0Stay calm, Mario. We can do this.\nJust breathe...and arrange those\nrings as fast as you can! Go, go, go!
W6C2_Beast_BuddyTalk_01	Think, think, think! Hitting the legs\ncaused them to retract before...\x0e\0\x04\0But my brother's jumping straight\nto the heavy blows! We won't have\ntime to go after each leg.
W6C2_Beast_BuddyTalk_03	He's definitely about to cause\nan earthquake...and we can't\nescape it!\x0e\0\x04\0We have to prevent him from\nattacking. Do we have some\nway to stop him cold?
W6C2_Beast_BuddyTalk_03_02	My brother can't move! Quick, grab\nhim before he can break loose!
W6C2_Beast_BuddyTalk_04	In our first battle with the Water\nVellumental, we found shelter on\nhigh ground...
W6C2_Beast_BuddyTalk_04_02	My brother's energy is drained!\nThis is our chance!
W6C2_Beast_BuddyTalk_04_03	Yes! He can't move!\nQuick, let's grab him!
W6C2_Beast_BuddyTalk_05	The Fire Vellumental is a real spitfire,\nso let's spit something on its fire to\nput it out!
W6C2_Beast_BuddyTalk_05_02	The fire's out! Now we can hit him\nwithout getting burned! The rest\nis in your HANDS, Mario!
W6C2_Beast_BuddyTalk_06	We can beat his Ice Vellumental\nform if we just memorize the safe\nroute and keep melting the ice!
W6C2_Beast_BuddyTalk_06_02	My brother lost his icy shell!\nI'm sure you can HAND-le him\nnow, Mario!
W6C2_phase2_01	*pant, pant*\nYou...surpassed the power of\nmy superior, folded paper...
W6C2_phase2_02	Brother...are you OK?\x0e\0\x04\0You must be exhausted. Using even\none Vellumental form can be—
W6C2_phase2_03	SHUT IT! I don't need your pity!\x0e\0\x04\0I folded you so we could turn this\nflat world into an origami kingdom...\x0e\0\x04\0But you betrayed me...and allied\nyourself with these paper peasants!\x0e\0\x04\0Don't you see, Olivia? We're both\norigami! Why are you fighting me?!
W6C2_phase2_04	Olly...we are origami, but this\nisn't what we were made for!
W6C2_phase2_07	We both started as simple sheets...\nbut we had souls folded into us.\x0e\0\x04\0We were made with love! Love of art,\nlove of creation...love for life itself.\nThat's what origami is all about!\x0e\0\x04\0We should be friends with ALL paper\nbeings. If there's love in our hearts—
W6C2_phase2_08	You're lecturing ME about love? Was\nthere love in the heart of that paper\nToad who scribbled all over me?!\x0e\0\x04\0We're nothing like that flat, flimsy\nfool. We were folded for greatness!
W6C2_phase2_09	I should have known you wouldn't\nunderstand. How could you? I made\nyou too perfect...too PURE.
W6C2_phase2_10	That's a mistake I'll soon correct.\nHere, Olivia. Let me show you the\ntrue power of origami...
W6C2_phase2_15	He...he just keeps unfolding! What's\nhappening? What do we do?!
W6C2_phase2_16	Look around you, Olivia. I'm folding\nthe very fabric of reality.\x0e\0\x04\0Origami embodies the limitless power\nof transformation...\x0e\0\x04\0With this power...I shall rid the world\nof all pathetic, paper-thin beings!
W6C2_phase2_19	You think we're gonna roll over just\nbecause you puffed up your chest\nand got all weird-lookin'?\x0e\0\x04\0I've had enough of you and your\nbad haircut. It's GO time!
W6C2_phase2_20	Bowser, wait!
W6C2_phase2_27	That was a very, uh...intimidating\nspeech, but he's too powerful here!\nHe'll crumple you for sure!
W6C2_phase2_21	Olly was right. This place is made of\npure origami power! It strengthened\nhim, so it could strengthen you too!
W6C2_phase2_22	\x0e\x02\0\0{s[150]}Let me fold you!{s[100]}\x0f\x02\0
W6C2_phase2_24	BWAHAHA! I love it! Nice work,\norigami girl!\x0e\0\x04\0OK! I'm gonna show this paper\npusher how a REAL final boss fights!
W6C2_Sumo_Tutorial_01	GUH! HRNGH!\nThis guy's tougher than he looks!\nI might...need some backup...
W6C2_Sumo_Tutorial_02	Whoa! Where did all of these\nMagic Circles come from?\x0e\0\x04\0Let's use these! If we slam the\nground with the 1,000-Fold Arms,\nwe can give Bowser an advantage!
W6C2_Sumo_Tutorial_03	When Bowser nears a Magic Circle,\nrun behind him and use it to summon\nthe 1,000-Fold Arms!\x0e\0\x04\0If Bowser shifts to a different spot,\npress  to cancel your attack and\nswitch Magic Circles!
W6C2_Sumo_Tutorial_04	Huh?! The Magic Circle vanished!\nI guess they don't last very long!
W6C2_Sumo_Tutorial_05	Mario! No! If you aim behind my\nbrother, it's Bowser who'll get\npushed over the edge!
W6C2_Sumo_000	Do you ever stop MEDDLING?\nThese should keep you busy!
W6C2_Sumo_001	Jump, Mario!
W6C2_Sumo_kpa_000	GRAH! HRRNGH! I'm gonna lose at\nthis rate... Make yourself useful,\nMario! Hit that thing!
W6C2_Sumo_kpa_001	ARGH! No! C'mon, Mario!\nUse that thing again!
W6C2_Sumo_kpa_002	This looks like the end!\nI'm too cool to go down like this!
W6C2_Sumo_kpa_003	GUHH! Too much cardio!\nI...I can't hold on!
W6C2_Sumo_ori_000	I will NOT be beaten by this bouncing\nblowhard! To me, my Folded Soldier!
W6C2_Sumo_ori_001	You think you've won...but\nthis battle is not over yet!
W6C2_Sumo_ori_002	Grrr! I will not surrender to the likes\nof you! Again, Folded Soldier!
W6C2_Sumo_ori_003	No! NO! I won't be defeated!\nFolded Soldier! Save your king!
W6C2_Sumo_bdy_000	Whoa! A big, angry face?!\nWhere did that thing come from?\x0e\0\x04\0We'd better act fast! Slam the\nground as many times as you can\nbefore it falls and crushes us!
W6C2_Sumo_bdy_006	Aah! It's gonna drop! Press  to run away!
W6C2_Sumo_bdy_003	Phew! That was too close... If we\nhadn't dodged, we'd have been\ncrumpled for sure!
W6C2_Sumo_bdy_001	Hey! That big face hit the ground\nso hard that it bounced Olly back\ntoward the center!
W6C2_Sumo_bdy_004	We were so close... We can't\nstop now! Let's do it again!
W6C2_Sumo_bdy_002	Phew! Bowser recovered!
W6C2_Sumo_bdy_005	OK! Once more, from the top!
W6C2_Sumo_ori_won_02	\x0e\x02\0\0{s[150]}This is the end for you!{s[100]}\x0f\x02\0

W6C2_Sumo_st_kpa_00701	Whose side are you on?!
W6C2_Sumo_st_kpa_00801	Aw yeah!

W6C2_Sumo_st_kpa_01003	What are you doing?!
W6C2_Sumo_st_kpa_01004	Are you crazy?!

W6C2_Sumo_st_ori_01602	I have you now!
W6C2_Sumo_st_ori_01603	How do you like THIS?!
W6C2_Sumo_st_ori_01701	Haha! I'm not done yet!

W6C2_Sumo_st_ori_02401	What?!
W6C2_Sumo_st_ori_02402	No! I refuse to be defeated!
W6C2_Sumo_st_ori_02403	Impudence!
W6C2_Sumo_st_bdy_00601	Use the Magic Circle!
W6C2_Sumo_st_bdy_00701	Not there!
W6C2_Sumo_st_bdy_00801	There!
W6C2_Sumo_st_bdy_00802	It's working!
W6C2_Sumo_st_bdy_01601	Hurry, hurry!
W6C2_Sumo_st_bdy_01602	Hit the POW Block!
W6C2_Sumo_st_bdy_01701	Get to that POW Block!
W6C2_Sumo_st_bdy_02001	Keep it up!
W6C2_Sumo_st_bdy_02101	Are we in the right spot?
W6C2_Sumo_st_bdy_02201	Wait! This isn't right!
W6C2_phase3_01	BWAHAHA! You got beat by a paper\npowerhouse! Eat gravity, you jerk!
W6C2_phase3_03	\x0e\x02\0\0CURSE YOOOOOU!\x0f\x02\0
W6C2_phase3_04	I can't believe it. I know there\nwas goodness in him, but...Olly\nchose to hate flat paper beings\nto the bitter end.\x0e\0\x04\0Goodbye, Brother. I hope we meet\nagain someday...

W6C2_phase3_26	That Origami Craftsman gave me\nsomething special before we left\nhis workshop. It's time to use it!

Bench_Location_W1C1_1	Ahhh! Finally, a minute to rest.
Bench_Location_W1C1_2	Hm? Mario, look at you! You've gone\nfrom pooped to pepped. I'm so glad!\x0e\0\x04\0I can't face all those Folded Soldiers\nalone. You're all I've got!\x0e\0\x04\0So stay rested, OK? When you see a\nbench, take a break and heal up!
Bench_W1G1_1	It's hard to relax while there are\nPaper Macho bad guys stomping\nthrough town...
Bench_W1G3_1	Listen. Do you hear that? It's the\nriver going, \x0e\x01\x01\0"splish, splash!" Ahhh...\nWhat a relaxing sound.\x0e\0\x04\0Ooh! Listen closer! You can even\nhear the fishies jumping.
Bench_W2G1_1_1	Mmmm. So refreshing. Nothing better\nthan mountain air.\x0e\0\x04\0I wonder if even the air here is red.\nIt looks clear, but...you never know.
Bench_W2G1_1_2	This world is so big, Big M...but I\nunderstand so little of it. *sigh*
Bench_W2G1_1_3	Remember how Bobby would always\nrun ahead of us and get lost? Ahhh,\nthose were good times...
Bench_W2G1_2_1	I wonder why leaves turn so red\nin the fall. Do you think they're\nembarrassed?
Bench_W2G1_2_2	No, that can't be it. They're just\ntrees... Now I'M embarrassed for\nsuggesting that!
Bench_W2G1_2_3	Remember Chestnut Valley? Bobby\nkept rolling away because he was\nso round... He was really good at\ngetting in trouble, wasn't he?
Bench_W2G2_2	I keep wondering...why is Shogun\nStudios named Shogun Studios?
Bench_W2G2_1	Oh! I know! It's because we're\nsho' gunna have a fun time here!\nRight? Maybe that's it...
Bench_W2G2_3	We had so much fun in this park\nwith Bobby...and we went to see\nthat special show too!\x0e\0\x04\0We helped him make so many great\nmemories...but I guess we made them\nfor ourselves too.
Bench_W3G1_1	We origami folk have a saying...\x0e\0\x04\0"For every mountain fold, there\nis a valley fold."\x0e\0\x04\0It's probably about the ups and\ndowns of life...or it could be about\nactual folding, I guess. Hard to say.
Bench_W3G1_2	Either way, that's pretty deep...\nand inspiring.\x0e\0\x04\0Even a dud like me might climb up\none of life's mountains someday.
Bench_W3G1_4	Come on, Big M! It's time to\ngo to the Great Sea!
Bench_W3G3_1	Even without the sun, this place is\nso bright! It's like it never sleeps.
Bench_W3G3_2	Mhmm, just as I suspected. It's super\nbright and lovely here when the\nsun's out.

Bench_W6C2_1	Does the shape of this hole in the\ncastle look...familiar to you?\x0e\0\x04\0Wasn't Luigi stuck in a chunk of\nbetween-dimension-type space\nthat looked just like this? Hmm...

Hint_Common_1	Ooh! Thank you for calling on\nme with . It's my first hint!\nNow for an actual hint. Umm...
Hint_Common_2	Press ! !
Hint_Common_3	Where are you going, Mario?\nWe have to look for Bobby\non Autumn Mountain!
Hint_W0C1_2	That hole in the wall looks like it\nmight be a way to sneak out!
Hint_W0C1_4	I'm feeling like a good hurry is in\norder. Is there a way out of here\nnearby?
Hint_W0C1_5	That voice was really scary!\nWhere did it come from?
Hint_W0C1_6	I feel like something's going down in\nthat room with the spooky voice.\nShould we check it out?
Hint_W0C1_7	Bowser has a secret? Ooh, what\ncould it be?
Hint_W0C1_8	He said there's a secret exit.\nDo you think that means it's\nhidden by something?
Hint_W0C1_9	Could the secret exit be in that\nroom where they were keeping\nBowser?
Hint_W0C1_10	Lookee there! It's a Magic Circle!
Hint_W0C1_11	Where do you think the secret exit\nleads? Oh...I bet that's a secret too.
Hint_W1C1_26	If you hit flowers, grass, and trees\nwith {c[404040]}, confetti will come flying out!\x0e\0\x04\0Come back to that big hole once\nyou've collected a lot of it, OK?{c[404040]}
Hint_W1C1_38	It might be time for you to head\nback over to that big hole!
Hint_W1C1_37	Try throwing confetti on the big\nhole with ! Yah ! Whee !
Hint_W1C1_27	Mariooo! Over here!
Hint_W1C1_28	Waaah, I say! Please come and\nhelp me!
Hint_W1C1_1	It's so quiet here. TOO quiet, maybe?\nMaybe. Let's find a way out of here.
Hint_W1C1_39	A Magic Circle in a place like this?\nHuh! What will happen if you use it?
Hint_W1C1_2	Maybe we should try going as far as\nwe can? See what happens?
Hint_W1C1_3	How about we head over to where\nPeach's Castle used to be?
Hint_W1C1_4	{s[080]}Did you just hear mysterious voices\nwhispering mysteriously? Yay? Nay?{s[100]}
Hint_W1C1_5	Do you want to see what happens\nif you pull on the dangly green\nthings hanging from the trees?
Hint_W1C1_6	That sound! Did you hear it? It's like\nsomething crashed into something.\nOr something!
Hint_W1C1_7	These mountains are big. Really,\nreally big. Maybe we should just\nkeep going farther.
Hint_W1C1_29	This place seems really familiar...\nMaybe things will change if we\njust keep going.
Hint_W1C1_30	Doesn't that big stump look like\nthe perfect place to take a quick\nlittle rest?
Hint_W1C1_10	It sounds like we need something\ncalled the Soul Seed to help him\nget his energy back. Should we\nask where to find it?
Hint_W1C1_11	Have we seen that big, golden\nfruit before? There's got to be\na way to get it, right?
Hint_W1C1_13	Aww, it's too bad the vine broke.\nBut maybe the golden fruit will fall\nif you shake the tree a bit.
Hint_W1C1_14	Did something come out of that\ngolden fruit?
Hint_W1C1_15	Did we just get the Soul Seed? Wow!\nThat's the thing that will give the\ntree grandpa his energy back, right?
Hint_W1C1_16	A shriveled seed won't help. I feel\nlike there's something that can fix\nshriveled things...but where?
Hint_W1C1_17	The spring! Didn't we see some old\nwrinkly stuff fall in there before?
Hint_W1C1_20	What do you think will happen if we\nthrow in something that's shriveled?
Hint_W1C1_21	Ooh, the seed is sooo smooth now!\nAnd it's overflowing with power!
Hint_W1C1_22	Did something happen to Ol'\nGrandsappy? What should\nwe do, Mario?
Hint_W1C1_23	Do you think we can fix the hollow\nspot in Ol' Grandsappy with ?
Hint_W1C1_24	What could happen if we give\nOl' Grandsappy that smooth seed?\nThe one that seems full of energy?
Hint_W1C1_25	We'd better hurry to where\nPeach's Castle used to be!
Hint_W1C1_31	Part of that fence looks like it's\nalready falling over. Could it fall\nthe rest of the way?
Hint_W1C1_32	Is there something we can do to the\nshrub to help that poor Toad?
Hint_W1C1_33	He's still not looking great. Could\nwe flatten him out somehow?
Hint_W1C1_34	That bench looks super cozy. It's\nalmost like it's waiting for us!
Hint_W1C1_35	There are SO MANY trees here! And\nthis mountain air is super tasty. It\nmakes my paper heart soar!
Hint_W1G1_1	We still haven't reached the castle,\nbut we've gotta be getting close.
Hint_W1G1_2	Could you use your hammer to\nhit the sticker on that monster's\nback?
Hint_W1G1_3	I think it's working! Keep hitting\nit, Mario!
Hint_W1G1_4	That big door we saw further in must\nbe the gate to Peach's Castle.
Hint_W1G1_35	I hear a voice. Is it coming\nfrom the yard?
Hint_W1G1_5	I hear a voice from the yard, but if\nthe door won't open, we should try\nopening something somewhere else.
Hint_W1G1_33	That awful thing is chewing on\nsomeone! How rude!
Hint_W1G1_6	How do we get to Peach's Castle...\nDo you want to try going in different\nplaces for now?
Hint_W1G1_7	So there's a sewer that connects\nto Peach's Castle...
Hint_W1G1_8	So a less handsome Red Shy\nGuy has something to do with\nthe manhole hook... Wait, which\none is less handsome?!
Hint_W1G1_9	Wait, what was the color and\nhandsomeness level of the guy\nbeing eaten by that monster?
Hint_W1G1_11	That OK-looking Shy Guy said the\nthing we need is in the red brick\nbuilding near the port.
Hint_W1G1_12	The manhole hook is in the\nstorehouse somewhere...but where?
Hint_W1G1_13	Those shelves are waaay too high. If\nonly we could shake them up to see\nif anything's up there...
Hint_W1G1_14	Hello, hello, Mr. Magic Circle!\nWe meet again.
Hint_W1G1_15	You got the manhole hook! Now we\ncan go and...hook that manhole!
Hint_W1G1_16	The entrance to the sewer is open!\nMaybe we can finally get to the\ncastle.
Hint_W1G1_18	Maybe we can find some sign of your\nbrother in the castle ruins.
Hint_W1G1_17	Such a majestic castle is now just\na pile of rubble... I sure hope your\nbrother is OK, Mario.
Hint_W1G1_19	If you're looking for memories\nof Luigi, I'll be right with you\nthe whole time...
Hint_W1G1_20	Look! A Magic Circle!
Hint_W1G1_42	Someone came out of that wall!\nQuick, straighten him out!
Hint_W1G1_21	We'd better check all over in case\nthere's a clue about Peach's Castle.
Hint_W1G1_22	Say, wasn't there a door over by\nthe wreckage? I feel like...there was.
Hint_W1G1_23	Maybe there's a clue about\nPeach's Castle up ahead.
Hint_W1G1_24	I wonder what's at the end of\nthe red streamer...
Hint_W1G1_38	The red streamer looks like it's\nconnected to the top of Overlook\nMountain.
Hint_W1G1_25	Where's that voice coming from?!\nTry hitting things until you find out.\nThat's the best idea I've got.
Hint_W1G1_26	That Folded Soldier was hiding a\nMagic Circle!
Hint_W1G1_27	I think that Toad over by the\nbridge needs help. Are we going\nto leave him behind?
Hint_W1G1_28	The blue streamer is up next. It looks\nlike it goes to that red mountain.
Hint_W1G1_39	It looks like the blue streamer leads\nto the top of Autumn Mountain...
Hint_W1G1_40	Let's head to Shogun Studios and\nlook for the blue streamer.
Hint_W1G1_43	I think we need to head to\nSweetpaper Valley to find the\nyellow streamer, right?
Hint_W1G1_48	The yellow streamer definitely ends\nin the desert somewhere. Let's go\nlook for it!
Hint_W1G1_47	I'm sure there's something else we\nshould be doing in the Scorching\nSandpaper Desert...but what?
Hint_W1G1_31	Maybe the docks will lead us to this\nGreat Sea place. With "Great" in the\nname, it's got a lot to live up to!
Hint_W1G1_30	I think we need the sea chart to\nget to the purple streamer. Do you\nthink Captain T. Ode might be\nat the mus\xe9e?
Hint_W1G1_44	The purple streamer is in the\nGreat Sea. Let's take the boat\nfrom the dock!
Hint_W1G1_41	The purple streamer is in the\nSea Tower.
Hint_W1G1_45	Is there just one streamer left?\nHooray! I think it's the green one\nstretching up to the sky.
Hint_W1G1_49	The green streamer is going right\ninto Bowser's Castle in Shangri-Spa.
Hint_W1G1_46	Let's get on the airship with Bowser\nand head to Peach's Castle!
Hint_W1G1_29	We've got to go back to the peak\nof the volcano to reach the castle\nand stop my brother. Head to the\nmus\xe9e pipe room if you're ready.
Hint_W1G1_32	Where are we?! This place is totally\ndeserted. There's, like, nooooobody\nhere at all!
Hint_W1G1_34	I want to make this the coolest\nmus\xe9e ever, so let's collect a\nbunch of stuff, OK?
Hint_W1G1_36	Oh my gosh. The mus\xe9e's collection\nis complete. The entire thing!\nThat's all thanks to you, Mario!
Hint_W1G1_37	You need a hint? Or just someone to\ndo some motivational yelling? Time\nto train, Mario! Work those hammers\nand boots!
Hint_W1C2_1	It's too dark to see anything! Can't\nyou flip the lights on? Somehow?
Hint_W1C2_2	So this is what it looks like beneath\nthe town. It's actually cute! But I\nwonder where it connects up with\nPeach's Castle...
Hint_W1C2_5	It's wide open here. Could this be\nthe end of the sewer?
Hint_W1C2_6	We found a pipe! Now if we could\njust get all of that water out of\nthere somehow...
Hint_W1C2_10	That red valve looks important.\nIf only we could make our arms\nall long and stretchy, eh?
Hint_W1C2_11	Are the critters by that red valve\ndoing some kind of...dance?\nWhatever it is, it looks like fun!
Hint_W1C2_12	Use the Magic Circle! Go on, now!
Hint_W1C2_7	I'm really curious about that red\nvalve and the Magic Circle...
Hint_W1C2_8	Where do you think all of that water\ncame from?
Hint_W1C2_9	The water's gone! Huzzah! Maybe\nnow we can get to that pipe.
Hint_W1C2_90	I don't get this graffiti...but I like it.\nDo you think there will be more of\nit if we come back later?
Hint_W1G2_1	The streamer connects way up\nat the top of the mountain.\nKeep climbing, Mario!
Hint_W1G2_2	We've got to keep heading up to\nthe streamer, past the flowers,\nno matter how pretty they are.
Hint_W1G2_3	Ooh! I've always wanted to be a\npart of a situation. Let see what's\ngoing on over there.
Hint_W1G2_4	Wasn't there some kind of situation\nhappening with the Koopas near the\nstairs? We should check that out!
Hint_W1G2_14	Those Koopa Troopas are going\nto have their precious rock stolen.\nCan't we do something?
Hint_W1G2_8	I'm worried about the Shell Stones,\nbut I'm also worried about the\nstreamer. It keeps going up past\nthe hill.
Hint_W1G2_7	Where are the Shell Stones? They\ndon't seem to be here. Should we\nhead for Overlook Mountain?
Hint_W1G2_9	We're supposed to take all of the\nShell Stones somewhere, right?\nMaybe the entrance to the temple?
Hint_W1G2_10	I think we should go inside and\ntake the tour! I mean...look for\nthe Earth Vellumental, of course.
Hint_W1G2_12	I wonder if we could use the power\nof the Earth Vellumental on that\ntower somehow...
Hint_W1G2_13	Did you see all those small holes\naround here? So different than\nthe big holes!
Hint_W1G3_1	Head for the red streamer! Oh, and\nenjoy all that intense mountain\nclimbing.
Hint_W1G3_3	Those huge, heavy things have such\nscary faces! I'd be less scared if we\ncould grab one of those shiny star\nthingies around here...
Hint_W1G3_2	Did we go all the way around the\nflower field? We didn't overlook\nanything...right?
Hint_W1G3_7	Those Koopa Troopas we saw during\nour climb were really passionate\nabout something.
Hint_W1G3_8	Do you think those Koopa Troopas\nwill let us have that Shell Stone?
Hint_W1G3_19	Was there a part of the wall near\nthe mountain that looked different?\nYou know, with the swaying grass...
Hint_W1G3_9	Lookit! Another Magic Circle!
Hint_W1G3_20	Don't flowing rivers sound nice?\nOoh, and look nice too? Maybe\nwe should go check it out.
Hint_W1G3_10	A mean fish took something precious\nfrom the Koopa Troopa. Let's try\nto fish it up!
Hint_W1G3_21	It looks like the path keeps going\neven beyond the tower.
Hint_W1G3_11	Don't those big, papier-m\xe2ch\xe9 things\nlook like they're having a ball?
Hint_W1G3_23	Oh! Those paper giants are playing\nwith a Shell Stone! Can we stop\nthem from kicking it around?!
Hint_W1G3_24	If the stone goes to one of those\nmonsters when it's down, maybe\nyou could steal it away!
Hint_W1G3_12	Hmm... Where should we take the\nShell Stones? Beneath the stairs\non Picnic Road, maybe?
Hint_W1G3_13	Let's ask the Earth Vellumental to\ndo something about that big pile\nof dirt. Its temple was on Picnic\nRoad, wasn't it?
Hint_W1G3_14	With the Earth Vellumental's power,\nwe could lower the rocky stuff at\nthe base of Overlook Tower in a jiffy!
Hint_W1G3_15	Let's follow the red streamer to\nthe top of Overlook Tower!
Hint_W1G3_16	I think we should take the tram\nand look for the blue streamer.\nMostly I want to ride the tram!
Hint_W1G3_17	The more we fish, the bigger fish\nwe might catch.
Hint_W1C3_1	Hello! Earth Vellumental?! Holler\ngently if you can hear us!
Hint_W1C3_2	Do you think my prayer reached\nthe Earth Vellumental? Would it\nbe a bad idea to try...knocking?
Hint_W1C3_3	Reveal yourself, Earth Vellumental!\nUm, pretty please? Or does your\nsilence mean you're further in?
Hint_W1C3_11	Looking closely at the rocks jutting\nout, it looks like you can move\nahead if you get the timing right...
Hint_W1C3_4	Did you see the side of that one\nshifty rock? There was definitely\nsomething weird about it!
Hint_W1C3_5	Fire is super dangerous! Is there\na safe spot we can use to get by?
Hint_W1C3_6	That's the biggest shell I've\never seen! Maybe it can protect\nus somehow...
Hint_W1C3_7	I feel like we must be getting close\nto the Earth Vellumental. I'm so\nexcited! But I'm nervous too.\nAre you ready?
Hint_W1C3_8	The Earth Vellumental turned into \na book?! Let's take a closer look\nat it.
Hint_W1C3_9	We'll need to get out of this\ntemple before heading up to\nOverlook Tower.
Hint_W1C3_10	Aww, I'm glad to see that the\nKoopa Troopas can all come\npay tribute here again.
Hint_W1C4_1	We're going to need plenty of\nconfetti to fill that hole.
Hint_W1C4_2	Should we take the elevator?\nYou did climb a whole mountain\nto get here—you deserve a break!
Hint_W1C4_21	If pulling doesn't work, should\nwe try pushing?
Hint_W1C4_3	I suppose we should head for the\nvery top of this tower, don't you\nthink? Ooh, I'm a little nervous...
Hint_W1C4_4	Now arriving at...nowhere, unless\nwe get rid of those sticks. Perhaps\nwe should...hit them?
Hint_W1C4_5	I think we should stick with the\nstairs for a while.
Hint_W1C4_8	Ooh, this is like one of those shows\nabout bad restaurants! Let's open\neverything and investigate more!
Hint_W1C4_39	Eww! You've got to do something\nabout all of those creepy crawly\nthings in the restaurant!
Hint_W1C4_23	I hate to even suggest this, but\nsomething inside the REFRIGERATOR\nwas making noise. *shudder*
Hint_W1C4_29	Eeeee! You've got one of those\nthings ON you, Mario! Get them off!
Hint_W1C4_30	Those things could be anywhere in\nhere! Maybe try hitting things and\nsee if there's a way we can climb\nup high to reach them all.
Hint_W1C4_34	Ewww, I can still hear them\nscrambling everywhere! Check ALL\nthe dark places and tight corners...
Hint_W1C4_31	Can they really climb walls?\nIt's a nightmare come true!\nPlease get them all, Mario!
Hint_W1C4_32	Have you really looked everywhere?\nEven behind everything? We've got\nto root them all out!
Hint_W1C4_33	I don't hear any scuttling in this\nroom. Let's go look somewhere else\nwhile I cover my eyes...
Hint_W1C4_24	Oh my gosh, those things are still\ncrawling around here, I just know it!\nPlease get rid of them!
Hint_W1C4_40	I can't believe how many of those\nthings were scurrying everywhere.\nBy the way, where ARE the stairs\nto the next level?
Hint_W1C4_37	Oh, did you finally get all of them?\nI'm sure that chef will be relieved,\nalthough not as relieved as I am!
Hint_W1C4_38	Yes! We can use that confetti\nto rebuild the stairs and get to\nthe next level.
Hint_W1C4_10	Ooh, I'd love to go in that cute caf\xe9\nand chat with the ladies! If there\nwere any ladies to chat with...
Hint_W1C4_11	More of those flying things!\nWatch out, Mario!
Hint_W1C4_12	Do you think you could trick one\nof those flying missiles into breaking\nthrough for you?
Hint_W1C4_13	You know what they say. In times\nof climbing, nothing beats a ladder.\nOK, I just made that up.
Hint_W1C4_14	They're raining down on us!\nWait...if an umbrella could stop\nrain, could it stop these missiles?
Hint_W1C4_15	I think we should get to the top as\nquickly as we can! Who knows when\nmore of those things will attack...
Hint_W1C4_18	Maybe you can knock it off from\nbelow somehow...
Hint_W1C4_19	That Magic Circle is perfectly\nplaced. Try using it to reach\nthat streamer!
Hint_W1C4_20	Let's head for the blue streamer.\nI wonder if the tram is working now\nthat the red streamer is gone...
Hint_W1C4_26	Is it weird that I feel bad for the\ntower? I hope they can fix all of the\nholes and get it opened again soon.
Hint_W1C4_27	Oh, all of the holes in the tower\nare fixed! Yay!
Hint_W2G1_1	Where do you think the blue\nstreamer will lead us next?
Hint_W2G1_2	We might be able to figure out what\nto do about the blue streamer if we\nkeep heading up this mountain.
Hint_W2G1_3	If the lake was full, we could ride in\nthe boat. I wish we could magically\nsummon a ton of water...
Hint_W2G1_4	Bobby's always running ahead of us!\nMaybe he spotted something cool?
Hint_W2G1_5	If we head to the Water Vellumental\nShrine, we might be able to meet the\nWater Vellumental!
Hint_W2G1_6	Bobby probably ran ahead of us to\nthe Water Vellumental Shrine.
Hint_W2G1_7	What do you think those little\nsquare tiles on either side of the\nentrance do?
Hint_W2G1_8	Hitting these tile thingies doesn't\nseem to do anything. Try to move\nthem some other way!
Hint_W2G1_9	Bobby must be lost in that tall grass.\nWe're coming, Bobby! Stay put!
Hint_W2G1_10	WHERE ARE YOU, BOBBY?! Argh!\nKnowing him, he's probably relaxing\nin a quiet corner somewhere...
Hint_W2G1_11	Bobby fell off the bridge! Are we\ngonna have to jump down there\nafter him?! Ohhh, gosh...
Hint_W2G1_12	Bobby is still in Chestnut Valley.\nI'm not sure how I know that...\nI just do!
Hint_W2G1_13	If we use the Water Vellumental's\npower, we can fill the lake back\nup and make that boat float!
Hint_W2G1_14	The lake is back! Finally! Let's hop\nin that boat and follow that blue\nstreamer downriver.
Hint_W2G1_15	That monkey by the dock might\nknow where we can find a master\noarsman, right? It's worth a try...
Hint_W2G1_16	It felt like there was something in\nthe can that monkey chucked at\nmy face. Should we return it to him?
Hint_W2G1_17	That monkey didn't even give us an\nanswer! Just chucks a can at me,\nthen bolts toward the tall grass\nwithout a care in the world. Sheesh!
Hint_W2G1_18	Sooo...we need a can opener, huh?\nThat sounds familiar. Wasn't there\nsome kind of par-tay happening\nnearby?
Hint_W2G1_19	Some of the guests are lost in the\ntall grass. We can't let their par-tay\nplans go to waste! Let's find them!
Hint_W2G1_20	We're taking this party-goer to the\ncanned-food par-tay, right?
Hint_W2G1_21	That one guy at the party had\nteeth that could open ANY can...\nor anyTHING, for that matter!
Hint_W2G1_22	Time to see if this monkey likes\ncanned tuna...
Hint_W2G1_23	He loves that tuna! Quick, ask him\nabout the oarsman, Mario.
Hint_W2G1_24	We can FINALLY ride that boat\ndownriver! Let's head to the dock.
Hint_W2G1_25	I'm glad this river is back to full\nstrength. It makes for a thrilling\nride! Can we do it again soon?
Hint_W2C1_1	Where did Bobby go? I guess we\nshould just follow the path for now...
Hint_W2C1_2	This place is dangerous! Poor Bobby.\nI'm starting to get worried...
Hint_W2C1_3	I hear Bobby's voice! HANG IN\nTHERE, BOBBY! WE'RE COMING!
Hint_W2C1_4	Phew. Found him. Now, onward to\nWater Vellumental Shrine!
Hint_W2C1_5	Did that chestnut shell just...move?\nIt isn't super fast, so maybe we can\noutmaneuver it!
Hint_W2C1_6	Gosh, it would be super convenient if\nthere was a pipe or something near\nhere, like right below us, that could\ntake us straight to Bobby. Gosh.
Hint_W2C1_12	Bobby is hanging from that tree like\na sad, wriggly apple. *sigh* Give it a\nwhack to knock him down, Mario.
Hint_W2C1_7	Bobby rolled away AGAIN! Why does\nhe have to be so...so...ROLY-POLY?!
Hint_W2C1_8	He's not over here, he's not over\nthere... Don't tell me he managed\nto rush AHEAD of us again?!
Hint_W2C1_11	Hmph. Bobby's just dozing off on\nthat scenic tree stump without a\ncare in the world.
Hint_W2C1_9	Try using your hammer to give Bobby\na gentle wake-up call, Mario.
Hint_W2C1_10	Remember when we had to chase\nBobby all over this valley? Ahhh,\nsuch frustrating nostalgia...
Hint_W2C2_1	Where's the real Water Vellumental?\nI hope we get to meet it soon!
Hint_W2C2_2	What's that square console-looking\nthing for, I wonder?
Hint_W2C2_3	Do you hear that noise? I hope we\ndidn't break anything...
Hint_W2C2_4	I still don't know what that weird\nsliding-tile thing is all about...but\nI bet we'll end up using it before\nwe're done in this shrine!
Hint_W2C2_5	Did you hear scuttling behind that\ncrack in the wall? What's making\nthat noise?
Hint_W2C2_6	That back wall looks like it has\na weird weak spot. But hey, what\ndo I know? Y'know?
Hint_W2C2_7	What do POW Blocks do again?\nDon't they make things flip over\nwhen you bop 'em?
Hint_W2C2_25	Aw, shoot! The POW Block is gone.\nWhat if we leave the room, then\ncome right back in?
Hint_W2C2_8	Look, Mario! That Sidestepper\ndropped something!
Hint_W2C2_9	Where did that Sidestepper take\nthis tile from? We should try to\nput it back where it belongs.
Hint_W2C2_10	This sliding-tile puzzle seems tough.\nI want to help! Call me with  if you\nget stuck, OK?
Hint_W2C2_11	I have to know where all this water\nis heading. Let's follow the flow!
Hint_W2C2_12	Wouldn't it be great if we could\nexplore the right side of this shrine\nnow that there's flowing water?
Hint_W2C2_24	This place is pretty big, even for a\nshrine! It goes on and on...and on...
Hint_W2C2_13	I bet it'd be fun to shoot water at\nboth of those round, wheely things\non either side of that little Water\nVellumental statue!
Hint_W2C2_22	Oh, look! A console thing! It kinda\nreminds me of that other, different\nconsole that looked juuust like this.
Hint_W2C2_14	Here's some great advice I learned\nby watching you. When in doubt,\nbop everything with your hammer!
Hint_W2C2_15	Looks like there's more to explore\ndown there...and who am I to stop\nMario from jumping into things?
Hint_W2C2_16	Another tile? Ah! This must belong\nto that second console! I'm getting\npretty good at this hint stuff, eh?
Hint_W2C2_19	We did it! Now there's even MORE\nwater. The Water Vellumental statue\nby the entrance must be so happy!
Hint_W2C2_20	Shall we wander into the Water\nVellumental's huge, fanged mouth?
Hint_W2C2_26	This might be a big moment, Mario.\nIf you want to prepare, you'd better\ndo it now!
Hint_W2C2_27	I can't wait to learn how the Water\nVellumental is folded!
Hint_W2C2_21	I can't wait to try the Water\nVellumental's power. Let's\nhurry back to the lake!
Hint_W2C2_28	I know the Water Vellumental is a\nsacred being...but it's just so CUTE\nwhen it's belly gets all big! Hee hee!
Hint_W2G2_1	I hope we have lots of fun in Shogun\nStudios! I mean, what's the worst\nthat could happen?
Hint_W2G2_3	I guess it's nice that the park isn't\ncrowded...but we can't run any of\nthese attractions on our own!
Hint_W2G2_4	Was that a Goomba that peeked\nout from that alley? In...cosplay?
Hint_W2G2_28	Wait! We're not going to ignore that\nGoomba, are we? She looked like she\nneeded our help!
Hint_W2G2_5	Worry not, captured staff members.\nWe're coming to save you! Onward,\nto the castle!
Hint_W2G2_36	I'm losing track of which areas we've\nexplored, Mario...\x0e\0\x04\0Have we tried going to the park's\nnortheast corner yet?
Hint_W2G2_6	Where, oh where is that gate key?\nMaybe someone who's been hanging\nout by the castle gate would know...
Hint_W2G2_19	There must be a staff member here\nwho can tell us how to get into the\nstaff room. Keep searching!
Hint_W2G2_21	So the staff room is in the east\nside of the park, eh? That would\nbe...the right. Right? Right!
Hint_W2G2_7	The east side of the park... The staff\nroom is to the right, right? Maybe\nthe key we need is in there!
Hint_W2G2_38	Wait, Mario! The key to the castle\ngate must be nearby...but where?
Hint_W2G2_25	I'm pretty sure the staff room is\naround here somewhere. If we look\nreeeal close, we might be able to\nfind the entrance!
Hint_W2G2_26	Well, this is definitely the staff room.\nSo...where's the gate key?
Hint_W2G2_37	Which room are we in now?\nHey! Anyone in here know where\nwe can find the castle-gate key?
Hint_W2G2_35	Is this the staff room? Hey! Anyone\nin here know where we can find the\ncastle-gate key?
Hint_W2G2_27	Still no key... Did we miss something\nin the staff room?
Hint_W2G2_23	WHERE is the master key to all of\nShogun Studios? Maybe someone\nelse in the staff room can help.
Hint_W2G2_8	First, a suspicious green guy...then\nthe park's master key. If we find the\ngreen guy, we might learn where the\nkey is hiding!
Hint_W2G2_9	That green guy is supposed to be\nin the ninja house, right?\x0e\0\x04\0But the Chain Chomp won't let us\npass! Maybe it's hungry?
Hint_W2G2_10	Think the Chain Chomp might like\nto gnaw on a bone?\x0e\0\x04\0Maybe those Dry Bones will trade\nus their bone if we can give them\nsomething easier to toss!
Hint_W2G2_11	OK, so...there was a prize that looks\neasy to toss in the sure-he-can dojo.\nIf we win it, we can give that to the\ntwo Dry Bones.\x0e\0\x04\0But...the dojo is out of sure-he-cans,\nso we can't win that prize until he\ngets a new set!
Hint_W2G2_12	OK! So this Ninji needs a pipe! Then\nit'll give us its sure-he-cans! But...\nwhere can we find a pipe?
Hint_W2G2_13	A straw is basically a pipe, right?\nI'm sure that Ninji will agree!\nAt least, I really hope it agrees...
Hint_W2G2_14	Finally, we have the sure-he-cans.\nLet's take these to the dojo and\nplay that game!
Hint_W2G2_15	If you clear the normal difficulty\nin this sure-he-can dojo, you'll win\nthat baseball! Good luck, Mario!
Hint_W2G2_16	If you ignore the autograph, this\nbaseball looks PERFECT for tossing.\nThose Dry Bones are gonna love it!
Hint_W2G2_17	I sure hope the Chain Chomp likes\nbones. They're such a great source\nof calcium!
Hint_W2G2_18	Now we can enter the ninja house\nand look for that green guy. Ooh,\nwhat if he's a green NINJA? How\ncool would that be?!
Hint_W2G2_32	Did you see the fun-looking building\npast the Chain Chomp? We should\nbe able to check it out now!
Hint_W2G2_33	Mariooooo! C'mon! I wanna see the\nninja house!
Hint_W2G2_34	Don't you want to go into the ninja\nattraction again, Mario? There's so\nmuch more fun to have—I mean, uh,\nclues to find!
Hint_W2G2_20	Do you think this master key will\nopen the castle gate? Let's find out!
Hint_W2G2_29	Think, think, think... Wasn't there\nsomething in the staff room that\nmight help us here?
Hint_W2G2_31	Weird! It looks exactly like one of\nthose Paper Macho Soldiers, but...\nit's not moving at all.
Hint_W2G2_30	That castle courtyard is packed.\nTo sneak by all those enemies...we\nmight have to BECOME our enemies!
Hint_W2G2_22	It's important to catch your breath\nsometimes. Let's make sure we have\nlots of fun here, Mario!
Hint_W2G2_24	Huh. The room on the left is almost\nexactly like the room on the right...\nThat seems WAY too coincidental.
Hint_W2C4_1	Deadly traps?! Yes! That sounds\nso, SO awesome!
Hint_W2C4_2	Have you tried hitting absolutely\nEVERYTHING with your hammer?\nThat usually turns up something!
Hint_W2C4_3	Looks like we cleared this trap.\nOn to the next room!
Hint_W2C4_4	Hmm. I guess we should try all sorts\nof stuff here! Open stuff, hit stuff,\nyank stuff... Do all the stuff!
Hint_W2C4_5	Aww, the ninja in this box looks\nstuck. Can you give him a hand?
Hint_W2C4_6	What's up with that hanging scroll\nin the back? Was it really that short\na second ago?
Hint_W2C4_7	Everything in this room looks the\nsame, but I bet there's a difference\nhidden somewhere...like on the floor\nmats or walls.
Hint_W2C4_8	This yard is pretty...but I don't think\nthere are any ninjas hidden here.
Hint_W2C4_9	Looks like we have to find the one\nsafe path through this room. Be sure\nto check the walls while we're here!
Hint_W2C4_10	Ooooh, that red rope is just ASKING\nto be tugged. Who are we to resist?
Hint_W2C4_11	Well, well! Some stairs, eh? Looks\nlike we're goin' up!
Hint_W2C4_12	I'm glad we found the way up...but\nwhere should we hop back down?
Hint_W2C4_13	Huh. No exit. That's...a problem.\nAnything in here look suspicious to\nyou? The floor, maybe?
Hint_W2C4_14	Where are we now? Is this another\ntrick? We need more clues...
Hint_W2C4_15	A Magic Circle appeared!
Hint_W2C4_27	YES! That was SO much fun, Mario!
Hint_W2C4_16	That was just a test run. Let's do it\nagain! This time, we'll REALLY look\nfor a way to open the castle gate.
Hint_W2C4_29	OK! We're learning! Let's do it again\nand REALLY look for the master key\nthis time. Please?
Hint_W2C4_28	I think I'm getting the hang of this!\nLet's go another round and REALLY\nlook for that green guy this time.
Hint_W2C4_17	My nintuition—that's ninja intuition,\nobviously—is telling me we won't find\nthe key to the castle gate in here.
Hint_W2C4_32	My nintuition—that's ninja intuition,\nobviously—is telling me we won't find\nthat master key in here.
Hint_W2C4_33	My nintuition—that's ninja intuition,\nobviously—is telling me we won't find\nthat green guy in here.
Hint_W2C4_18	This garden is pretty, isn't it?\nI'd love to look at the pond up\nclose...and that shed!
Hint_W2C4_19	Sometimes it's about hitting the\nspots where there ISN'T anything\nsuspicious! Tricky, tricky ninjas...
Hint_W2C4_20	The shed just opened! This ninja\nhouse has so many surprises!
Hint_W2C4_25	I wonder what's down those stairs...
Hint_W2C4_21	Those toothy things trapping Luigi\nlook like they're connected to all\nsorts of stuff down here...
Hint_W2C4_30	Those round, toothy, jaggy things\nlook like they fit together. Maybe\nyour hammer can move them!
Hint_W2C4_22	Luigi's looking pretty toothy and\njaggy himself. Think you can bop\nhim to flatten him out?
Hint_W2C4_23	Luigi is caught in those big, toothy\nthings! We have to save him!
Hint_W2C4_24	This "ruler over all other keys" key\nmight finally open that castle gate!
Hint_W2C4_26	We can't leave until we find every\nsingle ninja. I wanna become the\nmost amazing ninja ever!
Hint_W2C4_31	We may be ninjas \x0e\x03\x01\x04\xcd\xccL>supreme\x0f\x03\x01, but that\ndoesn't mean we're done training.\nLet's further hone our ninja skills!
Hint_W2C5_2	I don't see any captured Toads in\nhere, but we know the blue streamer\nis on the top floor. It's a start!
Hint_W2C5_3	I think I see some open seats in the\nfront row. Hurry! I don't want to\nmiss any of the action!
Hint_W2C5_4	The blue streamer is so close!
Hint_W2C5_5	Smash that streamer with the\n{s[100]}1,000-Fold Arms, Mario!{s[100]}
Hint_W2C5_6	We'd better get back to our seats.
Hint_W2C5_7	We saved the staff, so let's cut loose\nin Shogun Studios! Woo-hoo!
Hint_W2C5_8	That Shy Guy ballet was the best!\nJust thinking about it makes me\nwant to twirl...
Hint_W3G1_1	C'mon, Mario! Let's follow that\nyellow streamer all the way through\nSweetpaper Valley!
Hint_W3G1_2	This place brings back some difficult\nmemories. We miss you, Bobby...
Hint_Global_BOM_1	Let's hurry to the Toad Town docks.\nIf we can find that sea captain, he\ncan take us to the Great Sea!
Hint_W1G1_BOM_1	I think the docks are in the right\nside of town. From there, we can\nhead out into the Great Sea!
Hint_Global_BOM_3	If we can't find the sea captain on\nAutumn Mountain, we'll never reach\nthe Great Sea...
Hint_W2G1_BOM_1	Where is this sea captain hiding?\nSomething tells me he wouldn't have\nwandered too far from the tram.
Hint_W4G1_BOM_1	Our target should be straight ahead\nof the entrance to the Great Sea.\nJust look for a big, pink ship!
Hint_Global_BOM_2	It's go time, Big M! Let's return to\nSweetpaper Valley and save Olivia!
Hint_W3G1_BOM_1	Almost there. Hang on, Olivia! We'll\nfree you from that boulder soon!
Hint_W3C1_1	I think we're ready to go after\nthe yellow streamer, Mario!
Hint_W3C1_2	Let's go through the tunnel and\nsee where the yellow streamer\nleads. I'm feeling confident!
Hint_W3C1_3	It seems like we're stuck. But when\nin doubt, try hitting things! Maybe\nsomething is hiding...
Hint_W3C1_7	Hey! A Magic Circle!
Hint_W3C1_4	Aren't you going to help that\npoor Toad?
Hint_W3C1_5	I want to try riding in the Boot Car!\nI think we just leased it, so we might\nas well try it out...
Hint_W3C1_6	At times like this, I feel like Bobby\nmust be watching over us somehow...
Hint_W3G2_1	Let's keep moving, Mario. Maybe\nwe'll find the yellow streamer if\nwe just keep exploring.
Hint_W3G2_2	This desert is HUGE and probably\nfilled with cool stuff! I hope we can\nsee some of it while we look for\nthe streamer.
Hint_W3G2_3	Hmm. I hope it wasn't my singing.\nMaybe it still isn't the right song\nfor the birdies...
Hint_W3G2_4	Could the end of the yellow\nstreamer be just around the corner?\nWait, do deserts have corners?
Hint_W3G2_6	I hope we find someone who can\nread those mysterious letters in\nthat place where the lights are\nshining!
Hint_W3G2_7	Yeah, I definitely can't read that\nstrange writing. Maybe we should\ngo back to that town...
Hint_W3G2_8	Should we check with the desert\nhelp kiosk in town about where the\nprofessor Toad went?
Hint_W3G2_35	It sounds like we should look for\nthe Altar of the Sun in the\nScorching Sandpaper Desert.
Hint_W3G2_9	If I had to guess, I'd say that bowl\nof sand looks like the perfect place\nto set an offering.
Hint_W3G2_36	Ack! The cactus!\nUse the Boot Car!\nPress !
Hint_W3G2_37	Does the cactus have some of my\nbrother's stickers? What if you tried\nto hit them with the Boot Car when\nthe cactus is tired?
Hint_W3G2_42	All we can do right now is try\nto stay safe!
Hint_W3G2_38	Ooh, I see one of those stickers!\nHit it before it's too late!
Hint_W3G2_39	I think we might need to use\nthe hammer to reach that last\nsticker from above!
Hint_W3G2_10	Wow! It's so neat that the professor\ncan read that writing. Maybe we'll\nget to the bottom of this streamer\nmystery after all!
Hint_W3G2_11	Ooh, I want the professor to\nexcavate ALL those shiny spots!\nPress  anytime you find one.
Hint_W3G2_12	I think the professor wants to look\nfor more clues at the hotel. Should\nwe head back there?
Hint_W3G2_15	Hmm...if we need to perform a\nritual... Didn't we find a place\nto do that out in the Scorching\nSandpaper Desert?
Hint_W3G2_16	Hmm...those birds are just standing\nthere like statues. Could we startle\nthem with a bang somehow?
Hint_W3G2_17	Wouldn't it be cute if all of the\nbirds were looking at the center?
Hint_W3G2_18	I'm normally so shy, but sometimes\nI see a microphone and I just want\nto SING!
Hint_W3G2_19	Oh my gosh. I can't believe my\nsinging did THAT to the desert\nbird. I'm so embarrassed.
Hint_W3G2_20	Do you think we should explore\nthose lanky towers a little bit more?
Hint_W3G2_21	What do you think that ancient\nmessage means? Look around its\nfeet? That lanky statue's feet?
Hint_W3G2_22	That ancient message about "walls\nof waves" is so strange. Could it be\na wall with waves drawn on it?
Hint_W3G2_23	Twins entwined in needles...\nCould that be one of those\nspiky green things?
Hint_W3G2_24	"Eclipse the sun above the lake..."\nOh! There's a lake in the desert\ntown. Could it be there?
Hint_W3G2_25	The jewels that the professor dug up\nare so pretty! I wonder if they have\nanything to do with those towers...
Hint_W3G2_26	If these towers were actual Toads,\nI just bet they'd be happy with a\nlittle more light. Don't you think?
Hint_W3G2_27	It's almost like the towers are\nlooking at something now.\nBut what?
Hint_W3G2_28	We found a Magic Circle where the\nTemple of Shrooms is sleeping in\nScorching Sandpaper Minor, right?
Hint_W3G2_29	The yellow streamer actually\ngoes all the way into the Temple\nof Shrooms!
Hint_W3G2_30	The professor wants to look at the\nAltar of the Sun. Is it far in the\nScorching Sandpaper Desert?
Hint_W3G2_31	It's a pretty long staircase, but\nI wonder how far it goes on...
Hint_W3G2_33	It's really cold in here! Can you\nthink of a way to warm things up?
Hint_W3G2_34	Whoa, you found a new Magic Circle\nfor the Fire Vellumental!
Hint_W3G2_40	Let's head back to Toad Town so\nwe can set sail on the Great Sea\nand follow the purple streamer.
Hint_W3G2_41	We need the sea chart, but Captain\nT. Ode went to find his ship. Should\nwe check the mus\xe9e?
Hint_W3G2_32	This is more like what I expected\nfrom the desert. It's HOT!
Hint_W3G2_43	Well, this is a nice change of pace\nafter that blazing-hot desert!
Hint_W3G3_1	Maybe there's someone here\nwho can read the mysterious\nletters. Should we check out\nthat big, bright building?
Hint_W3G3_21	Could someone who reads mysterious\nletters be at the hotel?
Hint_W3G3_2	They said the professor is on the\nsecond floor of the hotel. I wonder\nwhat he'll be like...
Hint_W3G3_3	OK, so he's on the first floor, not the\nsecond. But at least we got to see\nthose cool pictures up there!
Hint_W3G3_4	Well, he's not here. Maybe there's\nan important clue about his current\nwhereabouts in his room somewhere!
Hint_W3G3_5	Should we check with the front\ndesk again about the professor?
Hint_W3G3_7	The murals on the second floor of\nthe hotel are just so fascinating.\nDo you think they're important?
Hint_W3G3_9	If the green guy is in town, we\nshould look around for him. Yay,\na night on the town!
Hint_W3G3_10	Ooh, I didn't see that Magic Circle\nin front of the stalls before! When\ndid that get there?
Hint_W3G3_11	Should we go back and take a look\ninside the hotel suite now that we\nhave the key?
Hint_W3G3_14	Did you see the side gates near the\ntown entrance? Maybe we can use\nthose now that we have a key!
Hint_W3G3_18	Wasn't there something we still had\nto do in the desert?
Hint_W3G3_19	I'm so glad all of those poor Toads\ngot their faces back. Now we can\ntalk to all of them!
Hint_W3C3_1	It's hot...but we should try our best\nto reach the Fire Vellumental.
Hint_W3C3_2	Hmm, I think the way the floor is\nlighting up is meant to tell us\nsomething, Mario...
Hint_W3C3_3	Yow! Those flaming buckets are\nhot! Use your hammer, Mario!
Hint_W3C3_8	If you can't dodge the fire, try\njumping over it!
Hint_W3C3_10	I think you're just going to have\nto run as fast as you can!
Hint_W3C3_4	I feel like we're close to the\nFire Vellumental. Are you ready?
Hint_W3C3_5	Ooh, another Bibliofold! I can't\nwait to see what powers this\none gives me...
Hint_W3C3_9	We did it! Let's head back outside.
Hint_W3C3_7	Whew! It's really hot, but I guess\nI'm not actually melting. So I'm OK!
Hint_W3C4_1	We've got to find the entrance to\nthe Temple of Shrooms. Where could\nit be?
Hint_W3C4_2	Where is the yellow streamer?\nIf only King Shroomses were here\nto tell us...
Hint_W3C4_3	Hmm... Do you think those statues\nlook like they're meant to be\nholding something?
Hint_W3C4_4	Ooh! It's frustrating that there\naren't any stairs on the left.\nCould we dig up a clue somehow?
Hint_W3C4_5	You found a Magic Circle! You know\nwhat to do now...
Hint_W3C4_6	Oh, those cheeky Ancient Ones with\ntheir silly hints! Does that mean the\nother sign will have a good hint?
Hint_W3C4_7	Is it just me or does it look weird\nnow that the two statues aren't\nmatching anymore?
Hint_W3C4_34	This temple is pretty creepy, but I\nthink the professor is hamming it\nup just a little bit...
Hint_W3C4_8	This place is so big! I hope we\ndon't get lost...
Hint_W3C4_9	Are those papier mummies?\nOr mummy m\xe2ch\xe9s? I guess it\ndoesn't matter—just do something\nabout them!
Hint_W3C4_10	There might be a switch around\nhere somewhere!
Hint_W3C4_11	We've got to help that poor Toad\nbefore we do anything else!
Hint_W3C4_12	What are we supposed to do with\nthose numbers? Do you think we\nneed to do something in that order?
Hint_W3C4_13	The four switches in the corners\nhave cute triangles on them.\nHow many triangles were on\nthem? One, two...?
Hint_W3C4_33	Oh, I wish we could help those poor\nToads stuck in the web... But we\ndefinitely can't help from here.
Hint_W3C4_31	We'd be able to learn something \nif there was ancient writing. Do you\nsee any of that around here?
Hint_W3C4_14	I wonder if there's a ★ somewhere\nin this room...
Hint_W3C4_15	I'm thinking really hard about\nthe design on the floor and the\n★ shape... They must be related!
Hint_W3C4_16	I'm not really feeling the groove\nin here, Mario. Let's look somewhere\nelse for the sound discs.
Hint_W3C4_17	There's something about this place\nthat makes me think a sound disc\nis nearby...
Hint_W3C4_18	Let's have the DJ play a sound\ndisc and hope for the best!
Hint_W3C4_19	There's something on the other\nside of the wall. You've tried hitting\neverything with a hammer, right?
Hint_W3C4_20	Who did that?! Ooh, I'd be so\nfrustrated I'd probably hammer\neverything in sight!
Hint_W3C4_21	It's almost like we need some\nsuper-stretchy arms for this...
Hint_W3C4_22	I think maybe we should look a\nlittle harder for more of those\npoor faceless Toads around here...
Hint_W3C4_23	I don't think there are any faceless\nToads around here, Mario.
Hint_W3C4_24	The power of ten... Do you think it'll\nwork if we all try pushing together?
Hint_W3C4_32	Eeek! I can't handle that many\nspiders! You'll have to do something\nabout them if you want a hint!
Hint_W3C4_25	Let's go back and look in the area\nwhere we found that first Toad\nwithout a face. On the first floor!
Hint_W3C4_26	I think we've got enough Toads!\nLet's go back to that place with\nthe DJ.
Hint_W3C4_27	Hey, look—a Magic Circle!\nMaybe you can use it to\nreach the streamer.
Hint_W3C4_28	Ooh, we should go see what the\ndesert looks like now that the\nsun is back in the sky!
Hint_W3C4_30	I bet those Toads are having a lot\nmore fun dancing now that they\nhave their faces back.
Hint_W4C1_1	Pretty quiet for a party boat...\nIs everyone on break?
Hint_W4C1_2	This boat is so huge and fancy!\nTraveling aboard this beauty must\nmake for some great memories.
Hint_W4C1_BOM_1	The elevator in the main hall will\ntake us right to the VIP stateroom.\nWe'll be out of here in no time!
Hint_W4C1_BOM_2	That elevator in the back will take\nus right to the VIP stateroom.
Hint_W4C1_BOM_3	Which part of this ship controls the\npower? There's gotta be some kind\nof map onboard that can help.
Hint_W4C1_BOM_4	Did you see anything on that map\nthat looked like a power source?\nSomething resembling electricity?
Hint_W4C1_BOM_19	That lounge was in bad shape, but\nthere's probably more to explore in\nthere. Who knows what we'll find?
Hint_W4C1_BOM_5	Wow, this place is wrecked! Most of\nthese fixtures look like they'd fall\napart with the lightest of whacks...
Hint_W4C1_BOM_6	I know what you're thinking—and\nyou should totally do it! It's already\ncracked, so...smashy-smashy!
Hint_W4C1_BOM_7	I bet this is where the captain keeps\nall of this ship's important stuff. See\nanything we can use?
Hint_W4C1_BOM_8	I want to check out this ship's\nwheelhouse. There might be some\nimportant stuff in there!
Hint_W4C1_BOM_9	The machines down here are so big,\nbut so...quiet. Guess we'll have to\nwake everything up.
Hint_W4C1_BOM_20	Looks like we're missing the part\nthat makes those big machines do\ntheir thing. Let's keep searching.
Hint_W4C1_BOM_11	That lever was a perfect fit...so why\ndidn't the machines turn on? Where\ndid they put the instructions?
Hint_W4C1_BOM_21	Keep turning that lever, Big M!\nI think it's doing something!
Hint_W4C1_BOM_12	I feel like we were close to something\nin that engine room. Can we go back\nand check again?
Hint_W4C1_BOM_13	The elevator should be working now!\nLet's head back to the main hall.
Hint_W4C1_BOM_14	That's the elevator in the back!\nIt should be working now. Let's\nhurry to the VIP stateroom!
Hint_W4C1_BOM_15	Quick! The VIP stateroom is through\nthat fancy door!
Hint_W4C1_BOM_16	The box! The yellow box, Big M!\nYou can't tell me you don't see it...
Hint_W4C1_BOM_17	We have to take my lockbox back\nfrom that big jerk on the bow! Check\nthe ship's map if you're lost, Big M!
Hint_W4G1_1	Where do you think the purple\nstreamer goes? We'd better not\nlose sight of it.
Hint_W4G1_2	If we want to venture into this fog,\nwe'll need a reliable sea chart...\nLet's find one of those first!
Hint_W4G1_3	I guess we should head back to\nToad Town. Hey, maybe we'll find\nCaptain T. Ode in the mus\xe9e!
Hint_W4G1_4	Onward, to Bonehead Island! If you\nget lost, just press  to check the\nsea chart!
Hint_W4G1_5	I know we have to follow the purple\nstreamer...but a quick stop at some\nof these islands might be fun!
Hint_W4G1_6	The purple streamer is wrapped\naround the Sea Tower. I guess we\nshould head there next!
Hint_W4G1_7	We're locked out of the Sea Tower!\nI guess we'll have to find something\nelse to do. Wanna sail to some other\nislands and explore for a bit?
Hint_W4G1_8	I can't stop thinking about those\nmarks I copied. There were four\ncircles, then a weird shape...\nWhat does it all mean?!
Hint_W4G1_9	I keep thinking about Crescent Moon\nIsland. There was something strange\nthere, right? I just can't get it out\nof my head!
Hint_W4G1_10	Are you sure we saw EVERYTHING\non Full Moon Island? We didn't\nmiss anything important?
Hint_W4G1_11	Where do you think that mushroom-\nshaped handle goes? Maybe it fits\nsomewhere...mushroomy? Hmm.
Hint_W4G1_12	Did we miss anything on Mushroom\nIsland? I feel like we're forgetting\nsomething important...
Hint_W4G1_13	The key we got from Luigi has a\ndiamond mark on it. Haven't we seen\nsome place shaped like a diamond?
Hint_W4G1_14	Are you sure we saw EVERYTHING\non Full Moon Island? We didn't\nmiss anything important?
Hint_W4G1_15	The key we got from Luigi has a\nfamiliar shape on it... Wasn't there\na symbol like that on my copied\nnotes from one of those islands?
Hint_W4G1_16	Shouldn't we head back to Diamond\nIsland? We never finished those\nthree trials!
Hint_W4G1_17	Maybe these orbs can help us follow\nthat purple streamer all the way up\nthat huge Sea Tower!
Hint_W4G1_18	The purple streamer goes allllll the\nway to the top of the Sea Tower!
Hint_W4G1_19	Our captain friends told me they call\nthis sea "great" because it's so big!\nIsn't that big? I mean, great?
Hint_W4G1_20	Oooh, what kind of island have\nwe found now?
Hint_W4G1_22	Ready to head back to the ship?\nThe captain might be waiting on us.
Hint_W4G1_31	Did we find all of the Toads on this\nisland? I feel like we missed some.
Hint_W4G1_23	If this island has eyes and a nose...\ndo you think it has ears too?
Hint_W4G1_24	Now that we've explored one ear\nhole, it'd be crazy for us to NOT\ncrawl into the other one, right?
Hint_W4G1_25	Huh! It looks as if the left and right\nsides of Mr. Bonehead are similar\nyet sliiightly different...but how?
Hint_W4G1_26	Did you hear that sound? It came\nfrom the center of Mr. Bonehead!\nWhat do you think it was?
Hint_W4G1_27	I never expected to find so many\ninteresting things inside this skull.\nLet's see what's in his nose next!
Hint_W4G1_28	I don't know why, but I'm curious\nabout the stuff we saw inside this\nskull's nose.
Hint_W4G1_29	That white, stoney person has\ntheir back to us! I wish they'd\nturn this way so we could talk\nface-to-face.
Hint_W4G1_30	Hm! This Toad looks...different. Can\nyou see what's written below him?
Hint_W4G1_32	Hey...didn't Captain T. Ode say he\nvisited this island a LONG time ago?\nHe's like a time traveler! So cool!
Hint_W4G1_33	We need a nice, big fire to melt this\nice. Any chance there's a you-know-\nwhat hiding on this island?
Hint_W4G1_34	Ha! I knew there'd be a Magic Circle\nhere somewhere! Time to unleash\nthe Fire Vellumental!
Hint_W4G1_35	What a cute little house! Wonder if\nanyone is home...
Hint_W4G1_36	We can't open the door, so I guess\nwe should move on...but I want to\ncome back here later!
Hint_W4G1_37	If we put something hand-sized and\neasy to grab on this door we can't\nopen, it might become a door we\nCAN open!
Hint_W4G1_38	This house's backyard is even cuter\nthan the front! But...where in the\nworld are the owners hiding?
Hint_W4G1_39	What's that thing on top of the\nbookshelf? Is there an easy way\nfor us to get it down?
Hint_W4G1_40	This may sound silly, but...is there\nany chance Luigi's idea might work?
Hint_W4G1_41	That book sitting on top of the shelf\nlooks a bit fishy to me... Maybe it's a\nbook full of fish facts?
Hint_W4G1_74	That book is so tempting... Go on,\nMario! Take a peek. I won't tell!
Hint_W4G1_42	We have to free the person who\nfolded my brother!
Hint_W4G1_44	I can't stop wondering why Olly got\nso mad at the Origami Craftsman.\nWhy would he lash out like that?
Hint_W4G1_45	Ooh! The buttons behind these\npatches of grass are making all sorts\nof stuff happen. Press some more!
Hint_W4G1_46	There's a Toad statue here! We're\ngonna check it out, right? It's so\nmysterious!
Hint_W4G1_48	This heart-shaped island is so cute!\nI love it!
Hint_W4G1_49	There must be some way to get that\nToad out of that barrel...
Hint_W4G1_50	There's a Toad statue here! We're\ngonna check it out, right? It's so\nmysterious!
Hint_W4G1_51	How did that Toad in the barrel\neven... No. You know what?\nBest to leave that a mystery.
Hint_W4G1_52	Hey! That Toad is calling for you!
Hint_W4G1_53	This Toad seems like a pretty big\nscaredy-cat. Can't even cross the\ntall grass alone... Sheesh!
Hint_W4G1_54	We'll never find the other Toads in\nall this tall grass! Don't we have an\nitem that can help?
Hint_W4G1_55	Of course! Our Toad Radar will help\nus find these Toads in no time!
Hint_W4G1_56	What do you think these Toads\nare gonna do after they all make\nit through all this tall grass?
Hint_W4G1_57	There's a Toad statue here! We're\ngonna check it out, right? It's so\nmysterious!
Hint_W4G1_58	Those Toads really know how to cut\na rug... Oh no. I think I just became\na Feelin' Fungi fangirl!
Hint_W4G1_59	Check out that Sidestepper in the\nwater! Looks like he's having...fun?\nI think?
Hint_W4G1_60	It's a Magic Circle! What do you\nthink this one's gonna do?
Hint_W4G1_61	Look at all of this! Who knew there\nwas so much cool stuff hiding just\nbeneath the waves?
Hint_W4G1_62	Did we miss any Toads on this\nisland? I don't see any... Oh no!\nWhat if they fell into the sea?!
Hint_W4G1_63	That fishing pole looks mighty\ntempting, doesn't it? I guess a\nquick break couldn't hurt...
Hint_W4G1_64	How are we supposed to get back to\nthe ship when our path is on FIRE?!
Hint_W4G1_66	I get why this place was named\nHammer Island...but "Fire Hammer\nIsland" would've been waaay cooler.
Hint_W4G1_67	Those tumbling rocks won't let up!\nBet it'd hurt to get bowled over by\none of those.
Hint_W4G1_73	Look at all these ? Blocks. Can you\nimagine how satisfying it would be\nto smash them all at once?
Hint_W4G1_68	Those rocks are SO huge. Make sure\nyou time your moves just right...and\nwatch your footing!
Hint_W4G1_70	Hold on to this joy, Mario. You may\nnever get another chance to smash\nthat many ? Blocks all at once!
Hint_W4G1_71	Great job, Mario!\nLet's go get your coins!
Hint_W4G1_72	Ooh! Are you gonna battle those big\nPaper Macho enemies again?
Hint_W4G1_Recall_1	Oh, and do you want to see those\nsymbols I copied one more time?\x0e\x01\x04\x14\n\0y\0e\0s\0n\0o\0\x01\0\0\0\0\0\0\0
Hint_W4G1_Recall_2	Do you want to see those symbols\nI copied earlier?\x0e\x01\x04\x14\n\0y\0e\0s\0n\0o\0\x01\0\0\0\0\0\0\0
Hint_W4G2_2	Three trials for three orbs, eh? If we\ncan win 'em, I want 'em!
Hint_W4G2_3	That multicolored Magic Circle is so\npretty... It's mesmerizing! Can we\ncheck it out? Please?
Hint_W4G2_4	Looks like we can enter this\ntemple now!
Hint_W4G2_5	Hmm. We can't just walk up to the\ntemple... What do we have to do to\nmake the entrance accessible?
Hint_W4G2_6	This temple is too high up! We have\nto lower it somehow.
Hint_W4G2_7	We'll never earn that orb if we\ncan't even enter the temple! Maybe\nsomething around here can help...
Hint_W4G2_8	We'll never get into that temple at\nthis rate. Want to take a break and\nexplore the mountains in the back?
Hint_W4G2_10	There's another Toad statue\nhere too?
Hint_W4G2_11	The trial is about to begin!\nGood luck, Mario!
Hint_W4G2_12	You aced it! Bring on the next trial!
Hint_W4G2_13	You did a great jorb, so let's\ngrab that orb! Hee hee.
Hint_W4G2_14	Yay! You cleared the trial!\nNow...let's get out of here.
Hint_W4G2_15	We got all three orbs! I guess we\nshould head back to the Great Sea\nand figure out where to go next.
Hint_W4G2_16	You've got power, wisdom, AND\ncourage, Mario...but I don't think\nthat's a secret to anybody.
Hint_W4C2_1	{s[075]}...We'd better p-p-press on, Mario.{s[100]}
Hint_W4C2_2	Brrr! Can we pick up the pace a bit?\nI worry we'll catch a cold before we\neven make it to the Ice Vellumental!
Hint_W4C2_3	It's SO cold. We'll freeze if we don't\nkeep moving! Just keep smashing\nevery suspicious-looking spot...
Hint_W4C2_5	If you're feeling stumped, try taking\na quick break to clear your head in\nthat small room nearby.
Hint_W4C2_6	Did you feel that shaking just now?\nIt felt like it came from outside...
Hint_W4C2_7	That pounding is so annoying!\nWe have to make him stop!
Hint_W4C2_8	Yes! Let's go, Magic Circle!\nM to the A to the G-I-C! Woo!
Hint_W4C2_9	Where did the other half of the\nMagic Circle go?! Do we have to\nfinish it ourselves?!
Hint_W4C2_10	That rock is a weird color, right?\nIs that some kind of clue?
Hint_W4C2_12	Those snowballs are in the way!\nWe'll have to put a stop to those\nFolded Soldiers if we want to pass.
Hint_W4C2_11	Wait. Isn't this the entrance to the\nmountain? We haven't met the Ice\nVellumental yet! Back in the pipe!
Hint_W4C2_13	Sliding on the ice is fun...until we\nstop. Use your hammer to hit the\nwalls and keep us moving!
Hint_W4C2_14	The Ice Vellumental must be close...\nGet ready, Mario!
Hint_W4C2_15	Time to learn the Ice Vellumental's\nspecial folds. I'll do my best!
Hint_W4C2_16	The moat is totally frozen. We can\nwalk over it now!
Hint_W4C2_17	Oh, hey...it's all icy here too! Wanna\nsee how far this ice goes?
Hint_W4C2_18	We got the Ice Vellumental's power!\nWe should finish those trials next...\nif we can reach the temples, that is.
Hint_W4C2_19	{s[075]}...Sheesh! It's still REALLY c-c-cold here.{s[100]}
Hint_W4C3_1	It looks like the Sea Tower is the\nonly way forward. We'll have to\nget up there sooner or later!
Hint_W4C3_2	Hmmm. Three round openings for\nthree round...somethings. That\ncertainly seems important.
Hint_W4C3_3	We got the door open, but it'll be\na long way to the top... Let's get\nstarted!
Hint_W4C3_4	Keep following that purple streamer!\nAllllll the way up!
Hint_W4C3_5	Moving platforms?! No fair! Are\nthere any platforms that won't\nlet us down?
Hint_W4C3_6	The poor Earth Vellumental is split in\nhalf... That one Water Vellumental\nnext to it looks really sad!
Hint_W4C3_7	That blue Sidestepper was carrying\nsomething! Which way did it go?!
Hint_W4C3_8	Getting over those moving rocks will\nbe tricky. I don't think we can do it\nwithout platforms!
Hint_W4C3_9	That tricky Sidestepper keeps hiding\nin the cracks! If we could block 'em,\nit'd be stuck out in the open...
Hint_W4C3_10	Aha! Gotcha now, you tricky little\nSidestepper. Go get it, Mario!
Hint_W4C3_11	If we feed this round, red ball to the\nstatue, it might stop feeling sad and\ncheer right up!
Hint_W4C3_12	If this Ice Vellumental gets a cavity,\nit can just melt its fangs with fire!\nThat'll save it a ton on dental work.
Hint_W4C3_13	Is there anything in here that could\nhelp us give the Fire Vellumental a\nstrong nudge from behind?
Hint_W4C3_14	If you're feeling stumped, try taking\na quick break to clear your head in\nthat small room nearby.
Hint_W4C3_15	Did you feel that shaking just now?\nIt felt like it came from outside...
Hint_W4C3_16	Those rocks are a weird color, right?\nIs that some kind of clue?
Hint_W4C3_17	Hey! It's another slippery slate! That\nmeans we get to slide around some\nmore. Let's do it!
Hint_W4C3_18	This looks familiar, doesn't it? Didn't\nwe have to remember the order of\nthese light-up floors last time?
Hint_W4C3_19	Now that the Ice Vellumental lost its\nfangs, its open mouth is just begging\nus to pass through!
Hint_W4C3_20	I knew the purple streamer would be\nall the way at the top of this tower!
Hint_W4C3_21	Go on! Use your {s[100]}1,000-Fold Arms to\nsmash that streamer!{s[100]}
Hint_W4C3_22	Hey, what's that writing in the\ncenter? Looks like that weird roll of\ntape was standing on something...
Hint_W4C3_23	Think there's a connection between\nthe Vellumentals and these four\nspots? There HAS to be, right?
Hint_W4C3_24	There it goes! PYOOOW! It's like it's\ncalling to us from above the clouds...
Hint_W4C3_25	Why do you think this tower was\nbuilt, anyway? Is it some sort of\ntribute to the Vellumentals?
Hint_W5G1_1	Is the green streamer the longest\nstreamer yet? I wonder how far it\nkeeps going...
Hint_W5G1_3	Let's talk to these Toads about\nsome spa treatments. I want to\nbe pampered for once!
Hint_W5G1_4	Ooh, Mario... We HAVE to go check\nout these hot springs. Even if I get\nsoggy, I need a good soak.
Hint_W5G1_27	I don't know what we're supposed\nto do exactly, but it couldn't hurt\nto relax for a while in a hot spring.
Hint_W5G1_5	We have a lot on our plate, but for\nnow? All we have to do is soak in\nthe hot springs and collect stamps.
Hint_W5G1_6	I think we should listen to this\ngroundskeeper fellow. He seems\nkind and trustworthy!
Hint_W5G1_7	Oh, the streamer is going into\nBowser's face! Are we going to\nhave to go into...Bowser's face?
Hint_W5G1_8	The Spring of Purification is the one\nclosest to the spa entrance, isn't it?
Hint_W5G1_9	We still have to fix Junior's\n\x0e\x03\0\x04\0\0\0\0, \x0e\x03\0\x04\x01\0\0\0, and \x0e\x03\0\x04\x02\0\0\0.
Hint_W5G1_10	We still have to fix the\n\x0e\x03\0\x04\0\0\0\0 and \x0e\x03\0\x04\x01\0\0\0.
Hint_W5G1_11	We just have to fix Junior's\n\x0e\x03\0\x04\0\0\0\0!
Hint_W5G1_12	We still need to fix Junior's\n\x0e\x03\0\x04\0\0\0\0 and \x0e\x03\0\x04\x01\0\0\0.\nLet's not worry about his lack\nof color for now...
Hint_W5G1_13	We just need to fix Junior's \x0e\x03\0\x04\0\0\0\0.\nLet's not worry about his\nlack of color yet...
Hint_W5G1_14	Is that thing serious about the hot\nspring being full? Do you want to\ntry just going in?
Hint_W5G1_15	Is it too hot for you, Mario? Maybe\nwe can add some cold water. Where\ndo you think it comes from?
Hint_W5G1_16	Do you think the water's OK now?
Hint_W5G1_26	Don't forget the stamp!\nWe have to get our free prize!
Hint_W5G1_17	Now that we have all of the stamps,\nlet's go back to the front desk.\nI can't wait to see what we'll get!
Hint_W5G1_18	Where could the secret spa be?\nIs there a Shangri-Spa map or\nsomething somewhere?
Hint_W5G1_19	There's something funny about\nthat map if you ask me. Almost like\nsomething hiding in plain sight.
Hint_W5G1_20	Look closely to the left of the\nfountain... It seems like there might\nbe a secret located there.
Hint_W5G1_21	Ooh! The Spring of Rainbows should\nbe able to restore Bowser Jr.'s color!
Hint_W5G1_22	I think Junior is ready to help us\nreach the clouds by the entrance\nto the castle... Are you ready?
Hint_W5G1_23	We can go inside Bowser's face—I\nmean castle—now! Let's go find\nthe end of that green streamer!
Hint_W5G1_24	Are you ready? Then let's head\nback to Bowser's Castle.
Hint_W5G1_25	You know, when this is all said and\ndone...we should come back here\nand really soak. Like, REALLY soak...
Hint_W5C1_1	All right! This should be easy—we\njust follow the signs to the Spring\nof Rainbows, right?
Hint_W5C1_2	Oh, c'est une pipe! I mean...it's a\npipe, Mario!
Hint_W5C1_3	So the pipe is clogged. Can we find a\nnew route and unclog it?
Hint_W5C1_4	Just press and hold  to hold on\nfor dear life when the wind blows.\nYou can do it!
Hint_W5C1_6	Is something blocking the pipe?
Hint_W5C1_7	Ugh, I'm getting anxious for another\nhot spring! Where's the entrance?\nCould it be hidden in the wall?
Hint_W5C1_8	I just want to soak in the Spring of\nRainbows! I don't know where it is,\nbut I feel like it's not here...
Hint_W5C1_13	Is this the hot spring? It's so dark.\nMaybe there's a sign we can look at.
Hint_W5C1_9	We get to play a game and then\nvisit the hot spring? All riiiight!
Hint_W5C1_10	Ahh...I'm feeling refreshed and\nBowser Jr. has his color back!\nLet's head back to the castle.
Hint_W5C1_11	Do you think they allow return\ncontestants on that show?\nWe should try again, Mario!
Hint_W5C1_12	Want to play Shy Guys Finish Last\none more time, Quiz Master?
Hint_W5C2_1	It's so wild out here! The hot spring\nmust be so natural...
Hint_W5C2_2	The tree we want to get to is on\nthe other side of the bridge.\nWhere's the side path?
Hint_W5C2_3	Is this the way to get to the\nother side? Let's find out...
Hint_W5C2_32	It seemed like maybe there was\na detour back there. Should we\ngo back and check it out?
Hint_W5C2_12	I guess maybe we should try the\nother path? Sorry that we seem\nto be taking the long way...
Hint_W5C2_5	What to do, what to do... We could\nat least tidy up these leaves while\nwe figure out how to proceed.
Hint_W5C2_6	Oh, there was a Magic Circle hiding\nthere all along!
Hint_W5C2_7	Oh, right, the bridge is still broken.\nLet's go back to the other path.
Hint_W5C2_9	Those flowers seem to be having\nfun. What are those things they're\nblowing up in the air?
Hint_W5C2_11	You know what to do. Use the\nMagic Circle, Mario!
Hint_W5C2_13	What is that horrifying thing?!\nWe should get out of here before\nit comes back!
Hint_W5C2_16	Eeeee! Let's get out of here\nas fast as we can, Mario!
Hint_W5C2_17	We've got a little farther to go\nto reach that big tree...
Hint_W5C2_18	It'd be great if we had hands that\ncould reach the ladder somehow.\nIs there something useful close by?
Hint_W5C2_19	A small Magic Circle? I might have\nseen a similar leaf somewhere.
Hint_W5C2_20	You found the Magic Circle!
Hint_W5C2_21	We got the ladder, so I guess we\nmight as well use it.
Hint_W5C2_22	I think we still need to get higher\nup in the tree to find the hot spring.
Hint_W5C2_25	C'mon, let's go back to that spot\nby the broken bridge.
Hint_W5C2_24	We must be getting close to the\nSpring of Jungle Mist...
Hint_W5C2_36	Hmm...not much of a hot spring\nwithout any water, is it?
Hint_W5C2_26	OK, so we've got to find the plug.\nIt's all just grass and trees around\nhere, though...
Hint_W5C2_27	Now that we found a Magic Circle,\nwe can use those stretchy arms!
Hint_W5C2_28	We found the plug! Do you think\nthe hot spring is ready for us?
Hint_W5C2_29	Well, the plug isn't doing much good\nlike that. How can we push it down?
Hint_W5C2_37	Finally! Now we can have a nice\nsoak in the Spring of Jungle Mist.
Hint_W5C2_30	Don't forget to get a stamp, Mario!\nWe need that stamp!
Hint_W5C2_31	We came, we saw, we spa'd.\nShould we head back to the\nmain resort?
Hint_W5C2_38	We came, we saw, we spa'd.\nLet's go back to the main resort\nand collect our prize!
Hint_W5C2_39	It sure was a jungle out there, huh?\nOH! I totally get that saying now!
Hint_W5C3_1	We've got to find Bowser and the\ngreen streamer. They must be in\nhere somewhere!
Hint_W5C3_2	Let's head up to the second floor.
Hint_W5C3_3	Did Kamek say he has a key in\nhis quarters?
Hint_W5C3_4	Are these ALL pictures of Bowser?
Hint_W5C3_5	There's something different about\nthis area, but what is it?
Hint_W5C3_6	Ooh! A Magic Circle was hidden in\nthe portrait of my brother!
Hint_W5C3_7	All right, now where's that\ngreen streamer?
Hint_W5C3_12	Let's remove that green streamer.\nIt's the last one, Mario!
Hint_W5C3_8	I think the streamer must be on\nthe second floor with Bowser.
Hint_W5C3_9	Try to hit those flying heads\nwith your hammer!
Hint_W5C3_10	You're going to have to peel Kamek's\nface off of that...thing. Be careful!\nThose magic attacks are strong!
Hint_W5C3_11	Now it's just a regular giant Paper\nMacho monster! You can beat it the\nsame way you've beaten the others.
Hint_W5C3_13	It's finally time to take down the\nlast streamer. Give it a good whack,\nwill you?
Hint_W5C3_14	I know you have your differences\nwith Bowser, but you should\nprobably help him down from there.
Hint_W5C3_15	It sounds like Bowser has a plan!\nShould you follow him down to\nthe supply closet on the first floor?
Hint_W5C3_16	Hmm, so you have to use the pillars\nsomehow to open the door. What's\nthe red button on the wall for?
Hint_W5C3_17	Does hitting the pillars with your\nhammer do anything?
Hint_W5C3_18	OK, so it seems like the red light\nneeds to flow through the pillars.\nDoes it need to hit that Bowser\nface on the wall?
Hint_W5C3_19	We need to do something about\nthe pillars in the storage room\non the first floor.
Hint_W5C3_20	You unlocked the door! I don't know\nwhat's on the other side, but\nBowser sure seems confident...
Hint_W5C3_21	I think you should go talk to\nBowser about his plan.
Hint_W5C3_22	He said to push the left button,\nso that's what I'd do. Even though\nit seems a bit confusing...
Hint_W5C3_23	We're so close to Peach's Castle!\nLet's make sure we're ready and\nthen go talk to Bowser.
Hint_W5C3_24	Bowser's waiting for us, remember?\nIn that room with his secret weapon\nor whatever?
Hint_W5C3_25	Oh, Bobby... I hope you're watching\nover us from wherever you are...
Hint_W6C1_1	It seems like we'll catch fire if\nwe touch that lava. We might\nneed a bridge to get across...
Hint_W6C1_2	Hey, a bridge! Can we get to\nBowser now?
Hint_W6C1_3	Let's hurry while all of those\nmonsters are stuck back there!
Hint_W6C1_4	We've got to keep moving forward!\nFor Kamek's sake!
Hint_W6C1_5	Ack! That huge rock is in our way.\nCan we get one of those monsters\nto help us blow it up?
Hint_W6C1_6	We've got to do our best! For Kamek\nand Junior's sake too!
Hint_W6C1_7	Look—Bowser is right over there!
Hint_W6C2_1	My brother and Princess Peach\nmust both be in there...
Hint_W6C2_3	We actually got the key this time!\nLet's use it and head inside.
Hint_W6C2_4	Where's my brother? Further in?
Hint_W6C2_5	Let's follow the princess. But watch\nout! You saw what happened to\nLuigi, right?
Hint_W6C2_11	I think we should go back and\nfollow the princess!
Hint_W6C2_7	How rude! First he steals the castle,\nand then he folds it into something\ncompletely different.
Hint_W6C2_32	I'm not even sure how to get inside.\nI don't think our key will work.\nMaybe try using your hammer...
Hint_W6C2_8	Use the Magic Circle to make\nthose stretchy arms, Mario!
Hint_W6C2_9	Does that look like the way in?
Hint_W6C2_33	Let's keep going! I know my brother\nis waiting for us.
Hint_W6C2_10	We can't let that Folded Soldier\nsee us! Is there a way to cross\nwithout being seen?
Hint_W6C2_12	You can try smashing the wall with\nyour hammer to make a path, but\nbe careful! You don't want to fall...
Hint_W6C2_15	Ooh...that was such a mean trick.\nCan we use the 1,000-Fold Arms\nto fold the path back?
Hint_W6C2_16	I'm not sure what to do next, but\ntaking out a Folded Soldier is never\na bad idea...
Hint_W6C2_19	Oh my gosh! Those Koopa Troopas\njust STOLE our Magic Circle!
Hint_W6C2_34	Ooh, dead ends are frustrating.\nCan you make some headway with\nyour hammer?
Hint_W6C2_24	I have a good feeling about the\nbox on the bottom left. After that,\nit's up to you, Mario...
Hint_W6C2_29	Oh no...another dead end!\nHave you tried knocking?
Hint_W6C2_30	Wow! Can we finally unfold Bowser?\nI can't wait to see what his face\nlooks like when it has a body!
Hint_W6C2_31	My brother must be close.\nI'm getting nervous...
Hint_W6C2_35	He's just on the other side of\nthat door. We can do this!
Hint_W6C2_36	We have to stop my brother!
Hint_W7C1_1	The big mushroom on that machine\nmust mean that a Toad lives here.\nWhat's up with that thing, anyway?
Hint_W7C1_3	There's a new pipe! We're going in,\nright? Isn't that your whole deal?
Hint_W7C1_4	If the sensor's battery gets low, we\ncan just...ree-char-jit. Hey! I sound\nlike a real engineer!
Hint_W7C1_2	Another pipe! Let's hop in and find\nout what's waiting on the other\nside. So many pipe mysteries!
Hint_W7C1_5	Is that a Toad sticking out of that\nmachine? What are they doing?
Hint_W7C1_6	"Fax travel" will let us hop right to\nthe Sensor Lab! Amazing! I have no\nidea how it works, but...it's amazing!
Hint_W7C2_1	This place looks sophisticated...\nA little TOO-phisticated for me.\nI'll keep quiet.
Hint_W7C2_2	That looked so refreshing.\nIt smelled great too!

Kinopio_KNP_Scarab_B	A scarab that patiently waits for Mario\nunder the rocks in the House of Tricky\nNinjas...just like a ninja would!

Kinopio_KNP_Dog_R	A fierce guard dog who can help\nyou become a fierce fighter...after\nyou unfold him.
Kinopio_KNP_Dog_Y	A good, good boy keeping watch over\nShogun Studios. It's OK to pet him—his\nbark is worse than his bite.
Kinopio_KNP_Mushroom_K	Most Toads can be mistaken for\nmushrooms. This one, even more so\nthan usual.
Kinopio_KNP_Mushroom_Y	A rare yellow mushroom. Found in\nplaces with plenty of sunshine and\nelectricity.
Kinopio_KNP_Pennant_K	A souvenir from a popular tourist\nattraction. Sure to liven up the\nspirit of any room.
Kinopio_KNP_Pennant_R	That surfing Snifit sure has some\nmoves, but where did that unusual\nboard come from?

Kinopio_KNP_FlowerB_R	A picture-perfect flower with an ideal\narrangement of leaves and petals.\nWhy does it smell like a mushroom?
Kinopio_KNP_Maple_R	A fallen friend from Autumn Mountain.\nIt's a bit thicker than a real leaf, which\nsomehow makes it more convincing.
Kinopio_KNP_Maple_Y	Toads come in a variety of colors, just\nlike autumn leaves...but they don't\nhave to fall out of a tree first. Phew!

Kinopio_KNP_Skull_K	A skull stuck to a cactus, punctuating\nthe dark desert with a ghastly grin. It's\na great tool for pranking scaredy-cats.
Kinopio_KNP_Snake_Y	Come on out, little fella! This origami\ncreation is a big hit among fans of\nthings that slither.
Kinopio_KNP_Monkey_B	A mischievous monkey who can move\nvery quickly. Certainly much faster\nthan a Toad!

Kinopio_KNP_Scorpion_Y	This critter may look tough, but it's\nsure to flee if you get too close. Was it\nplaying hide-and-seek with a Pokey?
Enemy_KUR	Goombas transformed into origami. All of\nthat folding has added some bulk, but\nreally, they're just as weak as ever.
Enemy_KURP	Paragoombas transformed into origami.\nThey're pretty smug about those wings,\nbut one stomp and they fall right off.
Enemy_HEI	Bashful blokes who like to hide behind\nmasks. If you're lucky, you might even\ncatch one riding a shell!
Enemy_NOK	Even though they've been transformed\ninto origami, these versatile villains can\nstill transform into a shell as well.
Enemy_TGZ	Don't underestimate their spiky backs.\nWithout some strong boots or a hammer,\nyou're in for a world of hurt.

Enemy_PUK	Though at home in the sea, they're not\nshy about jumping out and attacking\npassersby. You've been warned!
Enemy_DSN	They're rough, tough, big, and bulky.\nThat said, they're weak to star power,\nso slam 'em while you're sparkly!
Enemy_KBN	They make their homes near chestnut\ntrees. A good stomping will make them\ntopple over, so have at it.
Enemy_MUC	They're ready and raring to shoot some\ntrouble your way, and they're not shy\nabout calling for backup in battle.
Enemy_KNK	They like to slide side to side. It's\npretty snide. Their pincers are sharp\nas Scissors, so stomp at your own risk.

Enemy_HKN	If they spot a hammer coming, they'll\nuse their Ninji Vanish ability to turn\nthings around. Stomp 'em instead!
Enemy_KURB	Goombas wearing tough skulls on their\nheads. Even in origami form, that's still\npretty intimidating.

Enemy_PAT	Flying origami Koopa Troopas. Swoop in\nfrom above and stomp away their wings\nto secure the win.
Enemy_MET	Buzzy Beetles, transformed into origami.\nAs per usual, fireballs have no effect on\nthem. Must be some high-quality paper!
Enemy_TRS	One glance at Mario's twinkling blues\nmakes them freeze. They vanish in\nbattle, so don't lose track of them.
Enemy_KRN	They'll collapse into a bone heap upon\ndefeat, but not for long. Even the\nBoot Car can't keep them down.
Enemy_SNB	They wait in the sand to attack all who\napproach. They probably just need a\nhug, but...it's not advisable.
Enemy_BRSF	No one likes being surrounded by flame-\nthrowing bullies, so do your best to\navoid these bros.
Enemy_BRSI	The ice they throw is pretty. Pretty\ncold. And pretty painful. It's pretty\nmuch a bad idea to go near them.
Enemy_BRSH	They throw hammers at people, which is\nremarkably rude. And won't someone\nthink of the hammers?!
Enemy_GSG	Even as origami, a Scuttlebug's range\nis quite wide. They're hard to avoid,\nso stay on your guard.
Enemy_HEIP	They use tiny propellers to fly around\nthe Sea Tower in the Great Sea. Don't\nlet them fly circles around you too!
Enemy_PKFP	They look like adorable origami flowers,\nbut don't be fooled. If left to their own\ndevices, they'll spit fire at you.
Enemy_GBN	They spit up spiked balls on the regular.\nHow unsettling! Those spikes smart,\nso don't stomp them by mistake.
Enemy_GBNI	Mighty Spikes who thrive in the cold.\nUnless you use your hammer wisely,\ntheir snowballs will smash you flat.
Enemy_GBNR	You can't break a Blue Stone Spike's \nrocks with a hammer, so just do your\nbest to avoid them altogether.
Enemy_GES	They live in the Great Sea. They prefer\nthe water but will occasionally cause\nmischief on dry land.
Enemy_BRSB	Boomerang enthusiasts. Just when you\nthink you've dodged a 'rang, BOOM!\nRight in the back of the head.

Enemy_KSK	They fly around in circles, ever in wait\nto dive-bomb Mario on sight, as though\nthey have nothing better to do.
Enemy_METT	Notable for their large spike. They're\nnot fun to step on, so do yourself a\nfavor and pull out the ol' hammer.
Enemy_FPKF	The look like they're stuck in the\nground, harmless and immobile.\nLooks can be deceiving...
Enemy_PPK	They look like teeny Piranha Plants with\nleafy little feet. Though adorable, their\nfire is still fire, so stay alert.
Enemy_FPAC	Word to the wise: those spiky balls they\nkeep aloft by breath alone hurt a fair\nbit if they fall on you.
Enemy_POO	They live underground and pop up only\nto throw spinner wrenches at folks...\nespecially folks named Mario.
Enemy_HKN_G	Ninjis who like to lurk in tall grass.\nIf you hit one with a hammer, expect\nan angry counterattack.

Enemy_ETH	That thick shell offers great defense,\nso aim for its head, limbs, and especially\nits tail.
Enemy_WTR	Flies high and attacks with water. Send\nit to the ground with your boots, then\nuse the Earth Vellumental's power.
Enemy_FIR	Clad in ferocious flames. Use the power\nof the Water Vellumental first, and then\nunleash your 1,000-Fold Arms!
Enemy_ICE	A polar bear with ice-manipulation\npowers. It freezes to guard, so use the\nFire Vellumental's power to melt it.

Enemy_KPPR	Bowser, folded into a sumo wrestler.\nHe's ready to rampage in the ring\nand defeat Olly.
Enemy_KNGR	Olly, folded into a sumo wrestler. He's\ncool as a paper cucumber, with enough\nstrength to push even Bowser around.
Enemy_CBN	They move along walls fast. They won't\nfight you, but touching one will cause\ndamage, so maybe don't do that?
Enemy_KURK	You can't stomp them when they're\nsafe in a shoe, but a defeated one will\ndrop boots, so get to shoe collecting.
Enemy_KPAM	Known for getting dragged into battles.\nBesting one will earns lots of coins,\nso make defeating them a priority.
Enemy_OLV	An origami gal with a kind heart. She's\nKing Olly's sister but is teaming up with\nMario to stop her bro's reign of terror.
Enemy_KNG	The mighty origami king. Holds a bizarre\ngrudge against Toads and vows to wipe\nout paperkind with his origami army.

W0C1_1	Here we are. Peach's Castle!
W0C1_5	I'm gonna park the kart, OK?\nI don't wanna tip the valet.
W0C1_41	Sorry for the wait, Bro. Let's-a go\nsee the princess!
W0C1_44	Uh, Mario? I meant let's-a go\nthe other way. Toward Peach's\nCastle, Bro!
W0C1_97	It's kinda spooky in here, isn't it?\nAnd where is everybody? I'd expect\nto see at least one Toad by now...
W0C1_120	Mamma mia! I forgot our gift in the\nkart! I'll just dash over and get it.
W0C1_99	OK, I don't like that.\x0e\0\x04\0How'm I gonna get outside\nwhen the door is locked?!
W0C1_101	Don't worry, Mario. I know just\nwhat to do in situations like this.\x0e\0\x04\0You just gotta find Mario!\nRight, Mario?\x0e\0\x04\0...Oh.
W0C1_107	OK...I'm just gonna take a deep \nbreath and go find the key to this\ndoor. That's what you'd do, right?\x0e\0\x04\0Tell Princess Peach I'll be right\nthere if you see her first, OK?\nBye-bye!
W0C1_22	\x0e\x01\x03\x04\x02\0\0\0Mario... Is that you...
W0C1_23	\x0e\x01\x03\x04\x02\0\0\0How good to see you...
W0C1_24	\x0e\x01\x03\x04\x02\0\0\0Answer me this...\x0e\0\x04\0Shouldn't the Mushroom Kingdom...\nunfold? And be refolded unto glory?\x0e\x01\x04\x14\n\0y\0e\0s\0n\0o\0\x01\0\0\0\0\0\0\0
W0C1_25	\x0e\x01\x03\x04\x02\0\0\0And what of those...Toads?\nShouldn't they be silenced...\nfor all of eternity?\x0e\x01\x04\x14\n\0y\0e\0s\0n\0o\0\x01\0\0\0\0\0\0\0
W0C1_26	\x0e\x01\x03\x04\x02\0\0\0I see... Last question.\x0e\0\x04\0Will you crease yourself and be\nreborn, like me?\x0e\x01\x04\x14\n\0y\0e\0s\0n\0o\0\x01\0\0\0\0\0\0\0
W0C1_27	\x0e\x01\x03\x04\x02\0\0\0Wrong answer. Right answer.\nIt matters not. Your replies are\nall paper thin.
W0C1_78	\x0e\x01\x03\x04\x02\0\0\0\x0e\x03\x02\0Goodbye...\x0f\x03\x02
W0C1_118	\x0e\x02\0\0{s[150]}Mario?!{s[100]}\x0f\x02\0
W0C1_61	Always gotta make a flashy\nentrance, huh?
W0C1_62	Are you here for the Origami\nFestival too?\x0e\0\x04\0This dungeon-themed waiting lounge\nis a HUGE upgrade from the last\nfestival I attended. Very classy.
W0C1_63	You ain't seen Master Bowser\nanywhere, have ya?\x0e\0\x04\0It ain't like the big lug to leave us\nminions hangin' at a public event.
W0C1_8	Whoa, Mario! You're here?!\x0e\0\x04\0I'm a big fan—er, I mean...I've always\nwanted to battle you. Even if I get\nstomped, it would be an honor.\x0e\0\x04\0Wow! This is all so exciting! First I\nsee Princess Peach and now YOU.\x0e\0\x04\0I gotta say, the princess was a\nlittle different than I expected.\nLess...lifelike...
W0C1_9	\x0e\x01\x03\x04\x03\0\0\0\x0e\x03\x02\0Come with us...\x0f\x03\x02
W0C1_28	Yeah! What's next? I've never seen\na Toad before. Please tell me it's\na Toad!
W0C1_29	\x0e\x01\x03\x04\x03\0\0\0\x0e\x03\x02\0Not you.\x0f\x03\x02
W0C1_79	Aww, hope you don't have\nto wait too long, Mario.\nI'll say hi to Toad for ya!
W0C1_48	\x0e\x01\x03\x04\x02\0\0\0Mario...is that you?
W0C1_10	\x0e\x01\x03\x04\x02\0\0\0I need your help! I'm...I'm...\nI'm in a very strange place.\x0e\0\x04\0It's cramped and dark...almost\nlike I'm in between dimensions\nor something.\x0e\0\x04\0I'm not sure if I should be amazed\nor scared, but I'm kinda both?\x0e\0\x04\0If it's not too much trouble, I'd\nlike to get out now, please.\nIs there any way you can help?
W0C1_11	\x0e\x01\x03\x04\x02\0\0\0Are you leaving? It sounds like\nyou're leaving! Please help me...
W0C1_35	\x0e\x01\x03\x04\x02\0\0\0What was that? Did something\nlight up at your feet? Is it a\nMagic Circle?\x0e\0\x04\0That's good...I think. I mean, I'm\nnot really sure what you're \nsupposed to do with it...\x0e\0\x04\0Can you try to use it somehow?
W0C1_36	That...that sounded good!\nAre your arms all big and\nfoldy now?\x0e\0\x04\0I've heard about this! I think\nthose are called 1,000-Fold Arms.\x0e\0\x04\0Try feeling around a bit...maybe\nyou can help me escape from\nthis strange dimension.
W0C1_46	If it feels like the arms are off-\ncenter and out of control, maybe\ntry pressing {s[100]} to reset them.{s[100]}
W0C1_81	If you want to take a break,\ntry pressing  to drop the\n1,000-Fold Arms.\x0e\0\x04\0Then, if you want to change the\nsettings, press  to open the\nmenu and take a look at ⚙.
W0C1_65	\x0e\x01\x03\x04\0\0\0\0Tilt your controller\nto move the 1,000-\nFold Arms!\x0e\x01\x01\0
W0C1_117	Do you need to start over?\nMaybe try pressing  to reset\nthe position of the arms.\x0e\x01\x01\0
W0C1_129	If you're stuck, try pressing  to\nstop the 1,000-Fold Arms, then  \nto open the Menu and look at ⚙.\x0e\x01\x01\0
W0C1_66	More to the right...
W0C1_67	More to the left...
W0C1_68	A little higher...
W0C1_69	A little lower...
W0C1_70	A little to the right...
W0C1_71	A little to the left...
W0C1_72	Just a little higher...
W0C1_73	Just a little lower...
W0C1_74	{s[120]}Yes! You're right there!{s[100]}
W0C1_37	Wow! I'm free from that weird\nin-between dimension!
W0C1_80	...Oh, was I just stuck in that wall?
W0C1_12	You must be Mario!\x0e\0\x04\0My name's Olivia! You'd probably like\nto know a lot more about me and\nwhy I was trapped like that, huh?
W0C1_32	But...I don't think we really have\ntime for that now. Maybe we should\njust get out of here.\x0e\0\x04\0There's just one thing...I'm not\nexactly fleet of foot. Mind if I\nhitch a ride?
W0C1_76	Whoa, what'd you find? It looks\nbig and smashy. Maybe try pressing\n and see what happens!
W0C1_124	Whoa! You've already got a\nhammer in there! Well, don't\nmind me. I'll find space.\x0e\0\x04\0That thing looks big and smashy.\nMaybe try pressing  and see\nwhat happens!
W0C1_123	You know, I feel like I just had\na pretty good idea...
W0C1_122	I don't know if they'll always be\ngood ideas, but I'm always happy\nto share 'em with you!\x0e\0\x04\0Why don't you try pressing  if\nyou're stuck, and I'll see if I can\nthink of something useful?\x0e\0\x04\0Who knows? Maybe we'll get to\nknow each other and make a great\nteam! Is that how these things go?
W0C1_38	OK, I'm getting my bearings...\nI think we might be in the\ncastle dungeon.\x0e\0\x04\0Dungeons smell like...this place\nsmells, right?
W0C1_82	\x0e\x02\0\0{s[150]}HEY! KNOCK IT OFF!{s[100]}\x0f\x02\0
W0C1_13	Ow!
W0C1_39	Why you little...
W0C1_40	Seriously? Do you know who I am?!
W0C1_115	I can see what you're about to do\nto my minion, and I order you to\nCUT IT OUT!
W0C1_86	What did you see?\nNothing terrifying, I hope...
W0C1_14	\x0e\x01\x03\x04\x03\0\0\0\x0e\x03\x02\0That was the last of them...\x0f\x03\x02
W0C1_93	\x0e\x01\x03\x04\x03\0\0\0\x0e\x03\x02\0Except for the mustachioed one...\x0f\x03\x02
W0C1_52	OK, maybe I have time to explain\none little thing. Those stiff-looking\nguys are called Folded Soldiers.\x0e\0\x04\0I don't want to alarm you, but\nthey're unbelievably dangerous.\nI think we should try to avoid them.
W0C1_127	What do you think they meant by\n\x0e\x03\x02\0That was the last of them...\x0f\x03\x02\nanyway? The last what?
W0C1_15	I can hear the Folded Soldiers\ntalking... I think they might\nbe nearby!
W0C1_45	Eek! I knew they had to be nearby.\nWe're in danger!
W0C1_31	\x0e\x03\x02\0Where is the mustache...\x0f\x03\x02
W0C1_55	My minions! You monsters... I won't\nforget this. I'm gonna unfold my\nbody and fold YOURS into pretzels!
W0C1_56	Stop looking and start helping,\nwhy don't you?
W0C1_43	Mario! You're here too?\x0e\0\x04\0Well? What are you waiting for?\nGet me down from this thing!\x0e\0\x04\0Even you know this is no way to\ntreat royalty.
W0C1_53	Royalty? Ooh, nice to meet you!\nIs everyone in your kingdom also\na face?
W0C1_54	I've got a body too! Those folded\njerks just...bent it in ways that I\nwon't describe in detail right now.\x0e\0\x04\0It's seen worse, believe me.\x0e\0\x04\0Never mind that! I am the great\nKing Bowser, and I demand to\nbe set free and unfolded!
W0C1_57	Now, Mario... Ignore your floating\nfriend and get me down from here.\nBowser commands you!\x0e\0\x04\0I would do the same for you. You\nneed me as much as I need you.\nADMIT IT!\x0e\0\x04\0Plus...I can tell you a secret after\nyou free me. No one can resist a\ngood secret! BWAHAHA!
W0C1_125	Ow...
W0C1_128	Nooo! It's like pulling a bandage off halfway!
W0C1_16	...Oh. Kinda thought I'd just...\nunfold or something.\x0e\0\x04\0Bah! No matter!\x0e\0\x04\0Now, as for that secret I promised\nto tell you...there's a hidden exit\nin this room.\x0e\0\x04\0I heard those jerks talking about it.\nLousy, no-good, body-folding jerks...\x0e\0\x04\0Now hurry up and find it! And I'll\nLET you bring me along when you\nescape.
W0C1_17	Hey! Don't just leave me hanging.\nGet me down from here!
W0C1_30	C'monnnn! I know we've had our\ndifferences, but you've gotta help\nme out here!
W0C1_33	You wanna get out of here, right?\nRescue the princess? It ain't\nhappening without me!
W0C1_50	You're really getting the hang\nof those 1,000-Fold Arms, Mario!
W0C1_106	See? BWAHAHA!\x0e\0\x04\0Where would you be without me?
W0C1_102	*huff*
W0C1_103	Hey, slow down!
W0C1_104	I'm walkin' with my face here!
W0C1_110	Nobody makes Bowser walk with his face!
W0C1_111	I mean...obviously they DID...
W0C1_112	But they're not gonna get away with it!
W0C1_113	Whew!
W0C1_18	\x0e\x01\x03\x04\x02\0\0\0Why are you still so...flat?\x0e\0\x04\0Why haven't you joined me\nin folded glory...\x0e\0\x04\0Come...we can reshape you...
W0C1_92	She can't see me like this...
W0C1_83	Patience, Princess. This will do\njust fine.\x0e\0\x04\0So you're Mario. Princess Peach's\nhero, right?\x0e\0\x04\0Yes...you'll do quite well. Very crisp.\nBright colors. I can see it now...\x0e\0\x04\0So what do you say?\x0e\x01\x01\0 Will you\nvolunteer your paper body to\nthe cause?\x0e\0\x04\0Or will we have to...get crumply?\nJoin us! Yes or no...\x0e\x01\x04\x14\n\0y\0e\0s\0n\0o\0\x01\0\0\0\x01\0\0\0
W0C1_84	Hey! I'm crisp!
W0C1_87	Oh really? You expect me to fall\nfor such a simple trick?!\x0e\0\x04\0Take a good, long look at\nPrincess Peach. She's better\nthis way, don't you think?\x0e\0\x04\0No need to answer. You'll soon feel\nthe power of origami for yourself.\x0e\0\x04\0Folded Soldier! Come forth!
W0C1_88	Ah, I expected nothing less.\nAnd to be honest, I wouldn't\nhave it any other way.\x0e\0\x04\0Take a good, long look at\nPrincess Peach. She's better\nthis way, don't you think?\x0e\0\x04\0No need to answer. You'll soon feel\nthe power of origami for yourself.\x0e\0\x04\0Folded Soldier! Come forth!
W0C1_90	I've never seen a Folded Soldier\nlike that, Mario. Does it look like\none of your flat paper friends?
W0C1_42	\x0e\x01\x03\x04\x02\0\0\0...I never...got...to see...\x0e\0\x04\0\x0e\x01\x03\x04\x03\0\0\0...Toad...
W0C1_89	\x0e\x03\x02\0\x0e\x02\0\0{s[150]}Prepare to be folded!{s[100]}\x0f\x02\0\x0f\x03\x02
W0C1_19	So you defeated the first Goomba.\nBravo. I assure you it is far from\nthe deadliest creature in this realm.\x0e\0\x04\0I suppose there's no point in\nmaintaining this charade any\nlonger...
W0C1_20	\x0e\x02\0\0{s[150]}Brother!{s[100]}\x0f\x02\0
W0C1_121	No...it can't be. \x0e\x01\x01\0I didn't want to\nbelieve it could be you.\x0e\0\x04\0How many times did I tell you\nto stop? Please! You have to\nstop now!
W0C1_34	Now THAT is dysfunctional...
W0C1_85	Why couldn't Mario have simply\nleft you in that wall where I\nput you...\x0e\0\x04\0Sister, if you stand in the way of my\nambition, I'm afraid you will not\nshare in my glory as family.\x0e\0\x04\0Oh, and by the way...
W0C1_109	I am no longer your brother Olly.\x0e\0\x04\0I am KING OLLY!
W0C1_21	By the time I am done, all of those\nmiserable Toads will be folded...\x0e\0\x04\0The flimsy paper minions of\nBowser shall be reborn as loyal\nFolded Soldiers—serving me!
W0C1_96	And I shall fold, crease, and bend\nthe entire paper world to my whim...\nThe birth of a new origami kingdom!
W0C1_98	My goodness! What are we all\ndoing here?
W0C1_108	Princess Peach! You're back to\nyour old self! Wahoo!
W0C1_119	Wait...we're missing someone.\x0e\0\x04\0Where's Olivia?
W1C1.msbt
W1C1_387	\x0e\x02\0\0{s[120]}Watch out!{s[100]}\x0f\x02\0
W1C1_388	Unless you can float like me, I'd be\ncareful over there, Mario.\x0e\0\x04\0Do you see that huge hole in\nthe ground? I don't think you'd\nlike falling into it!\x0e\0\x04\0Maybe there's a way to fix it...\nBut how? Hmm...\x0e\0\x04\0Oh! I've got it. Catch this!
W1C1_393	Did you see the colorful scraps of\npaper that showered out of the\ntree when you fell? That's {c[cf2c12]}confetti{c[404040]}!\x0e\0\x04\0Everything here is made of paper,\nof course, so every little bit of\nconfetti is like a tiny piece of\nour world.\x0e\0\x04\0That's why I think if you gather\nenough confetti and sprinkle it\non that hole, it might just fix\nthe problem!
W1C1_58	See that little icon that's urgently\nflashing? That tells you how much\nconfetti you have.\x0e\0\x04\0Can you try hitting flowers, grass,\nand trees with your hammer to\nknock confetti loose?\x0e\0\x04\0And um...once you're done? I might\nneed rescuing again. So sorry...
W1C1_420	Mario? I have a feeling you've\ncollected enough confetti by now.\x0e\0\x04\0Maybe try heading over to the hole\nvery carefully...
W1C1_59	Um, I think your bag is filled to\nthe brim with confetti already.\nOoh, that rhymes!\x0e\0\x04\0Anyway, can you try heading over\nto that big hole now?
W1C1_421	Whoa! I can tell that you're a real\ngo-getter, but I'm not sure you have\nenough confetti yet...\x0e\0\x04\0I know it sounds rough, but hitting\nthe grass, trees, and flowers with\nyour hammer releases more confetti.\x0e\0\x04\0It won't hurt them, I promise!
W1C1_51	Oh dear. Are you not finding any\nconfetti to put in that shiny new\nbag I gave you?\x0e\0\x04\0Try hitting the trees, the grass,\nthe flowers—almost anything—with\nyour hammer!
W1C1_390	All right! Now, what you want to\ndo here is get kinda close to that\ntotally scary pit...\x0e\0\x04\0When you're ready, press  to\ntoss some confetti on it. Yah !\nHah ! Boosh ! Pow !\x0e\0\x04\0You don't have to do sound effects\nbut I think they're kinda fun!
W1C1_153	Ready for another round?\nFwoosh ! Zing ! Kapow !\nBoppo ! Uh... Plork !\x0e\0\x04\0Hurry—I'm running out of sounds!
W1C1_81	Whoa, are you OK? That's one\nway to test the depth of the hole,\nI guess...\x0e\0\x04\0I really hope you can find enough\nconfetti to patch the hole. We just\nmet and I'd like to get to know you!
W1C1_389	Yikes! Are you OK? I think you\ncould stand to throw some more\nconfetti on that thing.
W1C1_149	Did it work? It sounds like it worked!\x0e\0\x04\0Well, if it worked this one time, it\nshould work every time you find one\nof these. Call me optimistic!
W1C1_417	Oh no! I should have warned you\nabout falling into that hole so\nmany times!
W1C1_391	Oh no... I hope you won't always\nremember me for this moment\nalone, Mario...\x0e\0\x04\0Maybe you can help me get my\nhead unstuck somehow...
W1C1_396	Whew. That's much better.\nThank you!
W1C1_397	All right! Now...where are we?\x0e\0\x04\0There's no one around to ask for\ndirections...this could be a problem!\x0e\0\x04\0It seems like all we can do is explore\nthis area a little bit.\x0e\0\x04\0I don't know how much help I'll be,\nbut I'm always here to chat if you\npress . I'll do my best!
W1C1_82	Ooh! One of these, here?\x0e\0\x04\0Oh...that means my brother is\nalready folding this whole world\nto his whims. That's bad news!
W1C1_265	Wowie! I could soak this view up all\nday long. I mean, just look at the\ntop of the mountain. It's so...\x0e\0\x04\0WAIT! What's that?!
W1C1_268	That's the outer crust of Peach's\nCastle, isn't it?\x0e\0\x04\0I saw my brother's streamers\nwrapping around it, lifting it\ninto the air...\x0e\0\x04\0And then it was gone!
W1C1_270	\x0e\x02\0\0{s[120]}Wait! There it is!{s[100]}\x0f\x02\0
W1C1_269	See? Way up on top of that distant\nmountain? It's still wrapped up\ntightly with all of those streamers.\x0e\0\x04\0My brother could still be in there\nwith Princess Peach. Ooh, he's\nprobably just plotting away...\x0e\0\x04\0I'm going to stop you, Brother.\nAs your sister, it's my duty...
W1C1_264	Oh, speaking of brothers...\nUm...\x0e\0\x04\0I saw a green hat falling into\nthe hole where the castle used\nto be.\x0e\0\x04\0I'm so sorry. The green hat was\nrelated to your hat, wasn't it?
W1C1_267	Ooh, I just knew I was right about\nthat hat. This is a big problem!
W1C1_273	It might be good to hurry back\nto where it fell and see what's\ngoing on.\x0e\0\x04\0Oh! And we should look for your\nbrother while we're at it! I hope\nhe's OK too.
W1C1_309	{s[075]}Someone's here...{s[100]}
W1C1_314	{s[075]}Who is it?{s[100]}
W1C1_310	{s[075]}Someone with a mustache.{s[100]}
W1C1_311	{s[075]}It's a flat paper person...{s[100]}
W1C1_315	{s[075]}Is the mustache also paper?{s[100]}
W1C1_312	{s[075]}Looks almost like Grandsappy!{s[100]}
W1C1_313	{s[075]}Stranger alert!{s[100]}
W1C1_316	{s[075]}Is it one of the mean paper guys?{s[100]}
W1C1_317	{s[075]}It might be!{s[100]}
W1C1_318	{s[075]}Cool hat, though.{s[100]}
W1C1_319	{s[075]}He's just...wandering.{s[100]}
W1C1_320	{s[075]}Maybe he's lost!{s[100]}
W1C1_321	{s[075]}These whispers are probably creepy!{s[100]}
W1C1_322	{s[075]}Ahahah!{s[100]}
W1C1_323	{s[075]}Is he gonna pull it?{s[100]}
W1C1_324	{s[075]}We'll see...{s[100]}
W1C1_325	{s[075]}Should I freak him out?{s[100]}
W1C1_326	{s[075]}I can't stop looking at the mustache.{s[100]}
W1C1_327	{s[075]}Who does he think he's fooling?{s[100]}
W1C1_328	{s[075]}Look at him, strutting like he's cardboard.{s[100]}
W1C1_329	{s[075]}Has he found the spring?{s[100]}
W1C1_330	{s[075]}Show him the thing...{s[100]}
W1C1_331	{s[075]}Oh, this'll be good.{s[100]}
W1C1_332	{s[075]}Think he'll figure it out?{s[100]}
W1C1_333	{s[075]}Bahaha!{s[100]}
W1C1_334	{s[075]}Don't give him any hints!{s[100]}
W1C1_335	{s[075]}Mustache alert!{s[100]}
W1C1_336	{s[075]}What does he even want?{s[100]}
W1C1_337	{s[075]}Is he headed for the spring?{s[100]}
W1C1_338	{s[075]}He seems healthy enough...{s[100]}
W1C1_339	{s[075]}Look at him jump!{s[100]}
W1C1_340	{s[075]}Is he trying to help Grandsappy?{s[100]}
W1C1_341	{s[075]}Oh snap!{s[100]}
W1C1_400	{s[075]}Heehee!{s[100]}
W1C1_401	{s[075]}Saw that coming!{s[100]}
W1C1_342	{s[075]}Watch your step!{s[100]}
W1C1_350	{s[075]}That's gotta hurt.{s[100]}
W1C1_351	{s[075]}He just...fell?{s[100]}
W1C1_352	{s[075]}Right into the darkness...{s[100]}
W1C1_353	{s[075]}Ker-plunk!{s[100]}
W1C1_343	{s[075]}That's gotta sting.{s[100]}
W1C1_354	{s[075]}I can't look...{s[100]}
W1C1_355	{s[075]}Who installed those, anyway?{s[100]}
W1C1_356	{s[075]}Right in the body.{s[100]}
W1C1_357	{s[075]}Extreme damage!{s[100]}
W1C1_344	{s[075]}How can he just do that?!{s[100]}
W1C1_358	{s[075]}Just whacking things, huh?{s[100]}
W1C1_359	{s[075]}Not very green of him...{s[100]}
W1C1_360	{s[075]}Nice hammer.{s[100]}
W1C1_361	{s[075]}He's just...hitting stuff.{s[100]}
W1C1_345	{s[075]}Whoa!{s[100]}
W1C1_362	{s[075]}Nailed it.{s[100]}
W1C1_363	{s[075]}Not bad!{s[100]}
W1C1_364	{s[075]}Technically correct.{s[100]}
W1C1_365	{s[075]}Bingo.{s[100]}
W1C1_366	{s[075]}Ding ding ding!{s[100]}
W1C1_346	{s[075]}Nooope.{s[100]}
W1C1_371	{s[075]}Whoopsie.{s[100]}
W1C1_372	{s[075]}Yeah, uh, no.{s[100]}
W1C1_373	{s[075]}Whammy!{s[100]}
W1C1_374	{s[075]}D'awwwwww.{s[100]}
W1C1_375	{s[075]}Bzzzzt!{s[100]}
W1C1_98	{s[075]}Whoa!{s[100]}
W1C1_115	{s[075]}So sparkly...{s[100]}
W1C1_116	{s[075]}It's too bright!{s[100]}
W1C1_117	{s[075]}He can't be stopped!{s[100]}
W1C1_118	{s[075]}No fair.{s[100]}
W1C1_119	{s[075]}Oh, he's good.{s[100]}
W1C1_120	{s[075]}Superstar.{s[100]}
W1C1_121	{s[075]}So shiny...{s[100]}
W1C1_122	{s[075]}Well, well!{s[100]}
W1C1_123	{s[075]}Is that glitter?{s[100]}
W1C1_124	{s[075]}What a run.{s[100]}
W1C1_125	{s[075]}Twinkle twinkle...{s[100]}
W1C1_126	{s[075]}Simply divine...{s[100]}
W1C1_127	{s[075]}Gooooold!{s[100]}
W1C1_128	{s[075]}That's cool. I'll admit it.{s[100]}
W1C1_129	{s[075]}Whoosh!{s[100]}
W1C1_130	{s[075]}Wowowowow...{s[100]}
W1C1_431	Sure seems like a lot of weird\nstuff is happening...
W1C1_192	Um... Does it feel like we're not really\ngetting anywhere?\x0e\0\x04\0Sometimes when the folding gets\ntough, I like to take a break to\nclear my head.
W1C1_207	You know, just sit down somewhere\nnice and flat, with perfect lighting...\nLike on that tree stump!
W1C1_182	Remember that time when I was\ndreaming of taking a rest on a\nnice, flat tree stump?
W1C1_201	\x0e\x02\0\0{s[150]}HEY! Who's there?{s[100]}\x0f\x02\0
W1C1_172	You can't sit on ol' Grandsappy's\nhead, Mister!
W1C1_173	That's right! He's the elder of this\nforest. Show some respect! He's got\ntwigs older'n you!
W1C1_174	So what if he's been logged by\nthose nasty little Toads? He's still\nthe man, honey.
W1C1_84	{c[929292]}Yes, yes... *cough*{c[404040]}\x0e\0\x04\0{c[929292]}Thank you, darlings.\nBless your bark.{c[404040]}\x0e\0\x04\0{c[929292]}You, young man! Go back and tell\nyour flat paper friends what a state\nI'm in.{c[404040]}\x0e\0\x04\0{c[929292]}I've hardly the hardwoods to speak,\nlet alone learn you some manners...\n*hack*{c[404040]}
W1C1_411	That's right!
W1C1_412	Tell 'em, Grandsappy!
W1C1_413	No Toads allowed!
W1C1_178	Ol' Grandsappy here hasn't been\nthe same since they cut him down.
W1C1_179	That's why he's mad at y'all.\nFlat paper folks cuttin' down good\ntrees in their prime... Shame on you!
W1C1_180	Oh, and by the way... You need\nGrandsappy's permission if you\never plan on leavin', hon.\x0e\0\x04\0So now that you're here, better\nget comfy. 'Cause you're gonna\nbe here FOREVER.
W1C1_204	FOREVER?! I think that means a\nreally long time, and I can't deal\nwith that!\x0e\0\x04\0Um, Mr. Grandsappy? We're not\nwith those flat paper people who\ndid this to you.\x0e\0\x04\0And actually, I'm not even flat\npaper. I'm origami!
W1C1_203	{c[929292]}...Oh? Origami, you say? My eyes\naren't what they used to be...{c[404040]}\x0e\0\x04\0{c[929292]}Well, if what you say is true...then\nperhaps you may be of some\nassistance to me.{c[404040]}\x0e\0\x04\0{c[929292]}If you can find a way to restore\nmy energy, I may just let you two\nleave this place.{c[404040]}
W1C1_205	That's so wonderfully generous of\nyou, truly. I only wish we knew how\nto restore your energy.\x0e\0\x04\0Anyway, we're in a hurry ourselves,\nso we'll do our best to help.
W1C1_181	I guess if you're gonna help\nGrandsappy...we'll let you\nwander around a bit.
W1C1_399	There you go, child. Now you\ncan be on your merry way along\nthe mountain.
W1C1_402	Just don't go wandering off too far!\nYou gotta find us somethin' called\nthe Soul Seed.
W1C1_403	They say that's the only thing\nthat can help ol' Grandsappy\nget his energy back. Good luck!
W1C1_175	Y'all can go now. We removed\nthe curse! But don't come back\nwithout that seed...
W1C1_176	If I knew where that seed was\nI'd tell you!
W1C1_177	I did see a kind of golden fruit\ndangling from my cousin's neck\na while back.\x0e\0\x04\0It's too flashy if you ask me, but\nDOES anyone ask me? Noooope.
W1C1_196	{c[929292]}Ugh... Give it a rest, would ya?{c[404040]}\x0e\0\x04\0{c[929292]}You tryin' to turn what's left of\nme into splinters and toothpicks?{c[404040]}
W1C1_197	Oh! We're so sorry!\x0e\0\x04\0Mario, I don't think all of that\nhammering is getting us anywhere...
W1C1_23	Psst! This is Whispering Woods.\nPay your respects to\nOl' Grandsappy!
W1C1_22	Are you here to help\nOl' Grandsappy?
W1C1_283	Psst! My neighbor thinks she's\na branch manager ever since\nshe got that golden fruit...
W1C1_25	That was the loudest whisper I've\never heard. Is Ol' Grandsappy OK?!
W1C1_27	Sweet Sap Loggins is back!
W1C1_28	You're the one who saved Sweet\nSap Loggins? Thank you!
W1C1_303	I want one of those seeds...
W1C1_279	First they said I was showing off.\nNow they say the seed inside that\nthing can help Ol' Grandsappy!
W1C1_281	Did you collect the seed? I do hope\nit helps Ol' Grandsappy!
W1C1_295	Is Ol' Grandsappy OK? Have you\ngiven him the seed yet?
W1C1_301	I'll admit it now—I WAS showing off!\nAnd it worked too. Hmph!
W1C1_66	Paper? Origami? None of you would\nbe here if it weren't for trees.
W1C1_286	We were trying to scare you, but\nthat's just because we want to\nkeep Ol' Grandsappy safe.
W1C1_287	Isn't our spring amazing? You can\nthrow any old thing in it and it'll\ncome out fully energized!
W1C1_54	These leaves are itchy. I can't\nwait for fall!
W1C1_52	Is there a difference between flat\npaper and folded paper? Why are\nyou guys fighting?
W1C1_21	While you're exploring, you really\nshould check out the spring.\nIt's lovely right now.
W1C1_75	That sounded like Ol' Grandsappy!\nWhat happened?!
W1C1_78	I can hardly believe that Ol'\nGrandsappy and Sweet Sap\nLoggins are the same tree!
W1C1_304	We won't try to scare people away\nwith whispers anymore.
W1C1_305	I know you're busy, but if you ever\ncome back, I've got some stuff I\nwant thrown into that spring...
W1C1_56	Hit me!\x0e\0\x04\0No, really—hit me with that hammer,\nand I'll hook you up with some\nconfetti. Least I can do!
W1C1_53	I guess you folks are all right.
W1C1_63	With a mustache like that, I knew\nwe could trust you.
W1C1_13	Did you come back here just to\ntalk to me?
W1C1_14	It's rare to see a paper person with\nyour...unique characteristics.\x0e\0\x04\0Do I have to spell it out?\nI'm talking about your hat.
W1C1_15	Are you paper? I knew someone who\ngot turned into paper. Say hi to him\nfor me!
W1C1_17	Did you hear all that whispering\nbefore?\x0e\0\x04\0Oh, thank goodness! I thought it\nmight all have been in my head.
W1C1_16	One of the trees around here grew a\ngiant golden fruit and won't shut\nup about it.
W1C1_24	I can't believe all of the holes\naround here. I've seen thrift-store\nsweaters in better shape!
W1C1_18	Yeah, yeah. I see the mustache\nand the hat and the overalls.\nIt's all a bit extra if you ask me...
W1C1_19	Did you know I used to be in Ol'\nGrandsappy's band?\x0e\0\x04\0Well, technically I opened for them.\nA door, to be precise...
W1C1_64	Watch your step! You wouldn't\nbe the first paper to perforate\nyourself around here.
W1C1_65	Wow! You dashed over those spikes\nlike it didn't hurt at all! Having feet\nmust be so cool...
W1C1_29	Did something happen to\nOl' Grandsappy? What was that?!
W1C1_36	You. You came all the way back\nto talk to me again. So thoughtful!\x0e\0\x04\0I bet you call your parents all\nthe time.
W1C1_37	All right, all right. The hat is\ngrowing on me. I get it.
W1C1_38	Ugh! I can hear Sweet Sap Loggins\nsinging, but I can't see him.\nCan you describe him to me?
W1C1_39	Psst! Sorry for the terrifying\nwhispers earlier. I hope we get\nmore paper visitors like you!
W1C1_40	When I grow up I want to be\nSweet Sap Loggins! Literally!
W1C1_41	Will you fix all of those holes?\nOur whispers should be the\nscariest things in this forest!
W1C1_42	If it's not too much to ask...\nCould I have your hat's autograph?
W1C1_94	Did you hear that song?\nThat's gonna be in my head forever!\n...Oh no...
W1C1_95	Thanks to you, we shouldn't have\nto trap any more travelers for\nall of eternity or until they help us.
W1C1_110	You saved Sweet Sap Loggins!\nThat makes you almost as\ncool as him!
W1C1_208	{c[929292]}Hm? Do you have something for me?{c[404040]}\x0e\x01\x04\x18\x0e\0K\0e\0y\0I\0t\0e\0m\0\xff\xff\xff\xff\0\0\0\0
W1C1_213	{c[929292]}Ach! Ptooey!\nNope. That ain't it.{c[404040]}
W1C1_67	We can't give him THAT, Mario!
W1C1_404	What's wrong with that seed?\nA seed is a seed, isn't it?
W1C1_198	That IS the Soul Seed, isn't it?\nBut something's wrong with it...
W1C1_200	Yeah, it's almost like...it's got the\nsame problem as Ol' Grandsappy...
W1C1_199	There's a rejuvenating spring not\nfar from here that does WONDERS\nfor dry bark.\x0e\0\x04\0Maybe it could freshen up that\nseed a little bit!
W1C1_10	Eww! I hope there aren't more\nof those things crawling around\nmy branches. Get that one!
W1C1_20	I can't believe I had one of those\nfolded things hiding on me.\x0e\0\x04\0Is that what it feels like when you\nwalk into a spider web? Oh, now\nI feel terrible...\x0e\0\x04\0Here, take these and we'll call\nit even.
W1C1_43	Every time one of my leaves itches,\nI'm gonna think it's another one of\nthose things...
W1C1_60	The whole forest is grooving to\nthe bloomin' sounds of Sweet Sap\nLoggins again. That's more like it!
W1C1_09	So if you defeat one of those\nfolded creatures, it turns into\nconfetti...\x0e\0\x04\0That information could really\nsave a lot of trees, you know.
W1C1_44	Why are those folded guys so\nbent out of shape, anyway?
W1C1_61	I wish I had my own backup singers...
W1C1_08	You wouldn't believe the restorative\npower this spring has. Wrinkles?\nGone. Dry spots? Wet. It's amazing!
W1C1_12	Even standing close to the spring\nmakes you younger and more vital.\nI'm not gonna tell you how old I am.
W1C1_46	It's not like Ol' Grandsappy to\ngrunt in terror like that! He usually\ndoes regular old-tree grunts!
W1C1_291	Hey, this is great! Taking out\nthose Folded Soldiers released\na ton of confetti!\x0e\0\x04\0We can use as much as we can find\nwith all of the terrible holes around\nhere, I'd say.\x0e\0\x04\0What a great deal! We get rid of an\nenemy and get confetti to boot. And\nwhen they explode, it's like a party!
W1C1_293	Still, though...how are there\nalready Folded Soldiers this\ndeep into the forest?\x0e\0\x04\0Do you think they're just going\naround causing trouble everywhere?\nI have such a bad feeling about this.
W1C1_276	Hey, this is that spring that\nwe saw before.\x0e\0\x04\0I feel...calmer somehow...just\nstanding near it.
W1C1_278	Normally I wouldn't suggest this, but\ndo you think we should try throwing\nsomething in there?\x0e\x01\x04\x18\x0e\0K\0e\0y\0I\0t\0e\0m\0\xff\xff\xff\xff\0\0\0\0
W1C1_292	Are you going to put something\nin the spring?\x0e\x01\x04\x18\x0e\0K\0e\0y\0I\0t\0e\0m\0\xff\xff\xff\xff\0\0\0\0

W1C1_416	I'm not sure it would be a good\nidea to try that...
W1C1_419	That wouldn't be very Big M-like,\nBig M.
W1C1_442	Aren't you forgetting something?\nYou've got to pick that thing up!
W1C1_443	Yo! Big M! You can't leave\nwithout THAT!

W1C1_298	Did you hear that? I think it might\nhave been Ol' Grandsappy crying\nout!
W1C1_405	He seemed pretty feeble when we\ntalked to him—but that was no\nfeeble {c[929292]}URGGGGG{c[404040]}!\x0e\0\x04\0Oh no...\nOh no...\x0e\0\x04\0Do you think he's OK?!
W1C1_428	He's hurt!
W1C1_429	URGGGG?
W1C1_430	I hope he's OK...
W1C1_447	No time to stop and whack the flowers!
W1C1_448	Hurry, hurry!
W1C1_449	I can't handle more drama!
W1C1_450	I'm worried...
W1C1_451	What happened to WHISPERING?!
W1C1_452	Hurry, please!
W1C1_206	Oh dear...
W1C1_215	I...I can't look...
W1C1_225	Poor thing. He's a shell of himself.\nHollowed out like some wood shop\nproject gone wrong...
W1C1_241	I can't believe those horrible things\nganged up on Ol' Grandsappy and\ndid this to him. They...they deserve\nto be CHIPPED!
W1C1_240	Uh...Grandsappy? Can you hear us?\x0e\0\x04\0This doesn't look good. He was\nalready creaky. Now he's downright\nhollowed out!\x0e\0\x04\0OH!
W1C1_239	I've got an idea! Look closely at\nMr. Grandsappy's face. Doesn't it\nlook like one of those holes?!\x0e\0\x04\0Maybe that means you can fix him\nwith confetti by pressing !
W1C1_184	I don't want to remember him\nlike this. *sniff*
W1C1_185	He's half the stump he was before...
W1C1_186	I hope you find whoever did this\nand crinkle 'em up real good!
W1C1_223	{c[929292]}...Huh? What happened?\nFelt like some rapscallion was\nwhittlin' me down again. Did I\njust dream it?{c[404040]}\x0e\0\x04\0{c[929292]}Ah, I s'pose that's just the memory\ngoin' downhill. Aw, nuts...{c[404040]}
W1C1_224	Grandsappy's back, y'all!
W1C1_226	Let's see... Mustache? Check.\nCreepy eyebrows? Check. It's\nGrandsappy again, all right!
W1C1_227	Aww, thank you! He's still a shell\nof himself, but it's better than\nbein' a shell of a shell. We've got\nour precious elder back!
W1C1_228	Well, he's not hollow anymore.\nBut does it seem like he could\nstill be more energetic somehow?
W1C1_187	He's all filled out again! I mean...\nnot like he was in the glory days,\nbut still.
W1C1_188	It's good having Ol' Grandsappy\nback...even with his best days\nbehind him...
W1C1_189	He still needs that seed to get\nhis sap back!
W1C1_218	Is it working? How do you feel?
W1C1_219	It's doin' somethin'!\nWatch out, now!
W1C1_258	\x0e\x05\x01\x04\xf8C\0\0Feelin' kinda sappy now...\n(Sappy sappy...)\x0e\x05\x01\x04\xb0O\0\0\x0e\0\x04\0It's like I'm super happy now...\n(Happy happy...)\x0e\x05\x01\x040\\\0\0\x0e\0\x04\0I'm feelin' big and burly\nand it musta surely been you...\x0e\x05\x01\x04xi\0\0\x0e\0\x04\0(Oh, Sappy keep on singin' like\nthe good old days, oh yeah...)\x0e\x05\x01\x04\xc6u\0\0\x0e\0\x04\0(Here I go now...

W1C1_229	WOW! I was NOT expecting that.\x0e\0\x04\0Looking good, Grandsappy. I'm\nso happy for you!
W1C1_210	Yeahhh... Now that's what I'm\ntalkin' about! \x0e\0\x04\0That little seed was all it took.\nTightened up my timbers and\nput the funk back in my trunk.\nI'm young again!\x0e\0\x04\0I see no need to keep y'all waiting\nany longer—unless you wanna run\nthrough that song and dance again.\x0e\0\x04\0Shrubs! Open up for my main\nmustache and his li'l lady here.
W1C1_230	Great! Now we can keep making\nour way back to Peach's Castle.\x0e\0\x04\0Let's get a move on, Mario.\nI'm still pretty worried about\nyour green family...\x0e\0\x04\0Bye for now, Grandsappy! I'm glad\nwe could be of service.
W1C1_232	You got it!
W1C1_233	Yes, sir!
W1C1_234	On it!
W1C1_235	Roger that!
W1C1_236	Moving!
W1C1_237	Full shrub ahead!
W1C1_211	Thanks for everything, little ones.\nGood luck out there!
W1C1_190	Don't call him Grandsappy no more.\nHe's Sweet Sap Loggins, funkiest\ntrunk in these woods!
W1C1_191	Eeee! It's like the old days again!
W1C1_193	Call me a tree hugger, 'cause I\nwanna give all of YOU a big hug!
W1C1_242	Hey. Don't. Stop.
W1C1_243	Do I have a sign on my back?\nDidn't think so.

W1C1_245	Pretty straightforward, right?\x0e\0\x04\0Yeah, they made me out of one of\nGrandsappy's branches. Reduce,\nreuse, recycle, I guess...
W1C1_246	I guess it could be worse.\nMy uncle's a tongue depressor.
W1C1_248	*sigh* No, stop. What ever will I do?
W1C1_99	Uh-oh, what's that?\x0e\0\x04\0Some kind of face...head...hat...\nthing is stuck in that shrub!\nI've got a bad feeling...

W1C1_101	Wait, that's what a Toad looks like?\nWow, I was way off.
W1C1_102	That's because my face is all\nfolded up! Please, help me!
W1C1_103	You've gotta help me! I don't care\nwhat it takes—hammer me out of\nthis shrub if you have to!
W1C1_104	Mario! Don't leave me here!
W1C1_145	That's marginally better!\x0e\0\x04\0Now I just need some flattening\nout, I think...
W1C1_146	Um...can we save the conversation\nuntil after I'm fixed? Hit me again,\nMario! I can take it!
W1C1_147	I'm still not OK!
W1C1_432	That's helping!
W1C1_433	Just a bit more!
W1C1_107	I'm flat again! Thank you!
W1C1_406	I don't mean to be rude, Toad, but\nI have to ask...how did your face\nend up so bent and wonky?
W1C1_108	Oh, it's bad! Real bad!\x0e\0\x04\0These horrible folded guys showed\nup and started folding Toads left\nand right.\x0e\0\x04\0Most of us got folded before we\ncould even ask what was going on.\x0e\0\x04\0What do they have against Toads?\nIt's not fair! Toads have rights!\nThis is Toad abuse!\x0e\0\x04\0Aaaugh! I just retraumatized\nmyself!
W1C1_109	Sounds like Folded Soldiers to me.\nIt must be my brother's doing...\x0e\0\x04\0I know we've got a few other things\non our plate, but you'll help any\nToads we find, won't you Mario?
W1C1_170	I heard that! And I'm holding you\nto that affirmative gesture, Mario!\x0e\0\x04\0But us Toads can help you too.\nIf you press  during a battle,\nwe'll come {c[cf2c12]}cheer {c[404040]}you on.\x0e\0\x04\0The more of us you have cheering,\nthe more help we can give you.\nGood things will happen, I promise!
W1C1_171	Oh, we will charge you a modest\nfee for the cheering. Should have\nmentioned that.
W1C1_408	Ooh, that Toad is a shrewd one...\x0e\0\x04\0But it sounds like it could be a big\nhelp to have them cheer us on\nin battle, don't you think?\x0e\0\x04\0Let's save as many Toads as we\ncan and get them to root for\nus, Mario!
W1C1_68	Thanks, Mario! I'd been in there for\na long time. And you know what\ntents don't have, right? Bathrooms.
W1C1_79	Oh. There's no bathroom out\nhere, either.
W1C1_88	I was waiting for the swing, but\nthen that weird Goomba cut in line!
W1C1_134	Wheee!
W1C1_271	Do

W1C1_250	Fa

W1C1_254	Don't mind me!
W1C1_260	You must be tired, Mario.\nDo you want to try taking\na rest on that bench?
W1C1_137	Whew! The noise I felt compelled to\nconstantly make was really getting\nto me.
W1C1_138	I'll never take peace and quiet for\ngranted again.\x0e\0\x04\0I should probably retire from my\njob as a schoolteacher...
W1C1_70	Oh, thank you. I don't know why\nI was trying to cut more firewood\nlike that. I have plenty!
W1C1_77	I guess I'm just a bit nervous since\nthis is my first time camping.\x0e\0\x04\0I'm still not entirely sure how to\nget this fire started. Any ideas?
W1C1_83	I don't know why campfires are so\nappealing to me. Maybe because\nthey're kinda dangerous and wild?\x0e\0\x04\0I tried to get the same thrill from\ncliff diving, but I just, like, wafted\ndown, you know?
W1C1_69	I was hoping for a helping hammer,\nand I got a helping hand! You're\njust full of surprises.
W1C1_157	I was hoping for a helping hand,\nand I got a helping hammer!\nYou're just full of surprises.
W1C1_136	What a beautiful day. I feel like\nnothing bad could happen here.\nUnrelated, I have amnesia.
W1C1_71	Ah, thank you. I was upside down\nwith the log side up. Now I can be\nupside up with the log side down.\x0e\0\x04\0Or...something.
W1C1_76	What time is the BBQ feast?
W1C1_87	I was worried I'd be done in by\nmy own deliciousness. Thank you!
W1C1_141	Just glad to be here and not in\nsome horrible Goomba's stomach,\nyou know?
W1C1_74	It was so lonely back here with\nno one to talk to... I had to come\nup with an imaginary friend.\x0e\0\x04\0She's actually pretty cool! Do you\nwant to hear all about her?\x0e\0\x04\0...Oh. Yeah, I guess you can press\n to get a hint from your real\nfriend whenever you want, so\nyou wouldn't understand...
W1C1_142	...Wanna get a hint from your friend\nwith ? I could just, y'know, hang\nout and listen... I wouldn't be a\nbother, I promise.
W1C1_73	I got bored, so I bloomed.\nCan you bloom—I mean—blame me?
W1C1_80	...I bloom myself.
W1C1_72	Thanks for saving me from that\nwood pile. But these creases are\nso deep... Will I go back to normal?
W1C1_143	Maybe I could pick up a side gig\nas an accordion...\x0e\0\x04\0Completely unrelated, why do you\nthink that square patch of grass\nis a different color?
W1C1_144	Whoa! That shocked the folds\nstraight out of me!\x0e\0\x04\0So I guess there was a hidden\nblock there, huh? That's probably\na good thing to remember.
W1C1_257	Whoa! That shocked the folds\nstraight out of me!\x0e\0\x04\0So I guess there was a hidden\nblock there, huh?\x0e\0\x04\0I probably shouldn't have been so\nshocked. The ground was a different\ncolor, so I knew SOMETHING was up.
W1C1_03	We used to be trees, but don't feel\nbad for us. We'll turn into ashes\nand grow again.
W1C1_05	I see why people build houses out\nof wood now. We're so dry in here!
W1C1_263	\x0e\x02\0\0Firing it up so you can wolf it down...\x0f\x02\0\n\x0e\x02\0\0Welcome to Toad's BBQ Foodeatery!\x0f\x02\0\n\x0e\x02\0\0(All firewood used is happy to burn.)\x0f\x02\0

W1C1_282	Light me!
W1C1_285	We must burn.
W1C1_297	Are things heating up?
W1C1_299	Fire it up!
W1C1_306	I can't wait!
W1C1_300	NOW we're firewood!
W1C1_302	Nice and smoky.
W1C1_307	Ahh...
W1C1_114	Hmm, should we try cooking\nsomething here?\x0e\x01\x04\x18\x0e\0K\0e\0y\0I\0t\0e\0m\0\xff\xff\xff\xff\0\0\0\0
W1C1_155	I don't think you want to try\ncooking THAT on a barbecue!
W1C1_274	Yes! Finally!
W1C1_277	I'm on fire!
W1C1_284	Burn, baby, burn!
W1C1_160	YeeeeeoOOOOWWW!
W1C1_163	That was too close for clam!\nI mean too clam for comfort.\x0e\0\x04\0I mean...I've been in that clam\nfor way too long...
W1C1_166	Oh! It's you, Mario! Did you save me?\nThat's so cool of you!\x0e\0\x04\0I'm actually the caretaker here.\nI left to search the Great Sea for\nexciting, innovative BBQ ingredients.\x0e\0\x04\0It was a great adventure, but I\nmissed cookin' up baby back ribs...\nso it's good to be back, baby!
W1C1_262	Can I help you? The Toad who lives\nhere isn't home right now, and\nhas actually been gone for kind of\na long time...
W1C1_289	My resident Toad is back, but\nthere seems to be a change in\nthe residence dress code...
W1C1_290	Welcome!
W1C1_296	See you later.
W1C1_96	Ahhh, it's nice and warm here...\nand it smells like ribs!
W1C1_158	I bet that tree in the woods has\ngrown pretty tall again. Might be\ntime to commit to a deck extension...\nOoh, I could add a rotisserie nook!
W1C1_159	You remember that big tree in the\nforest? Kinda sounds like it's\nsinging when the wind blows right?\x0e\0\x04\0Biggest tree we ever logged! And\ntotally worth it. Now we've got all\nthe scrap and firewood we need.
W1C2.msbt
W1C2_9	Ack! It's so dark in here... Why\ndoes everyone seem to like this\nplace so much?\x0e\0\x04\0Can you turn on the lights, Mario?\nOtherwise it'll be dark all the way\nthrough this place.
W1C2_12	Look, someone's here!
W1C2_13	Who's there?!
W1C2_14	Yes! I'm saved!\x0e\0\x04\0Oh, Mario... I had to run down\nhere and hide from those horrible\nFolded Soldiers.
W1C2_15	Pardon me—I should introduce\nmyself. I'm the curator of Mus\xe9e\nChampignon \x0e\x01\x01\0in Toad Town!\x0e\0\x04\0It's a museum with a splendid\ncollection of objects, music,\ntreasures, origami, and other\nwondrous items.
W1C2_21	And we have even managed to\nacquire the legendary Super Marino\nsea vessel, \x0e\x01\x01\0believe it or not!\x0e\0\x04\0I do hope you'll come visit soon!\nWe're open...even with all of the\norigamized crime we've seen of late.
W1C2_28	Mus\xe9e...\nMarino...\nI'm trying to remember those words\ninstead of that Toad's face.\x0e\0\x04\0It just kept getting closer...it was\nall I could focus on! But maybe the\nwords were more important.\x0e\0\x04\0Should we go back to town and\ncheck out the Mus\xe9e, whatever\nthat is?
W1C2_29	Mus\xe9e...
W1C2_30	Marino...
W1C2_1	Hey, there's a pipe over there.\nI wonder where it leads...\x0e\0\x04\0I bet you can hardly contain\nyourself when you see a pipe\nthat inviting, huh?
W1C2_16	Oh no! It's all flooded.\x0e\0\x04\0We can't get across with all of\nthat water there. We'd get soggy!
W1C2_3	Ooh, a Magic Circle. Did those mean\nFolded Soldiers hide it?

W1C3_35	\x0e\x01\x03\x04\x02\0\0\0The following section of the path\nhas been left in its historically\nauthentic uneven state.\x0e\0\x04\0Please watch your step.
W1C3_36	\x0e\x01\x03\x04\x02\0\0\0You are looking at a holy image\nrepresenting the full, glorious form\nof the Earth Vellumental itself.\x0e\0\x04\0Although the spirit is fully invincible,\nkindly direct your attention now to\nthe beast's great tail.\x0e\0\x04\0In certain...tales, the spirit's still-\nformidable hind portion is described\nas less than 100 percent invincible.\x0e\0\x04\0It is this combination of great power\nand weakness that has endeared\nthe Earth Vellumental to so many!\x0e\0\x04\0This marks the last spot on the\ntemple tour. Consider donating\ngenerously and frequently.
W1C3_63	Huh? Is this the end? It's kind of\na letdown, isn't it?
W1C3_94	Hmm...this might be silly, but\nmaybe it's worth a try...
W1C3_91	\x0e\x01\x03\x04\x02\0\0\0\x0e\x03\x01\x04\x9a\x99\x99>Dear Earth Vellumental...\x0f\x03\x01\x0e\0\x04\0\x0e\x03\x01\x04\x9a\x99\x99>If you're there, please find it in\nyour heart to lower the rocky\npile keeping us from the streamer.\x0f\x03\x01\x0e\0\x04\0\x0e\x03\x01\x04\x9a\x99\x99>Lastly, thank you for all of\nyour generous gifts and, um...\nturtley goodness.\x0f\x03\x01
W1C3_92	Well, that did nothing. Now I'm\nall embarrassed for trying!\x0e\0\x04\0Mario...do something, please!

W1C3_47	Oh, wow, thank you so much.
W1C3_89	I didn't do it!\x0e\0\x04\0...All right, it was probably me.\nI ripped out a bunch of gears and\nwires and stuff while I was in there.\x0e\0\x04\0*sigh* Just put some coins in and\nI'll give you the spiel.
W1C3_27	You really wanna hear it?\nUgh, FINE. Put the coins in and\nI'll give the speech.
W1C3_28	I just wanted to see the Earth\nVellumental. Now I've heard that\nrecording more than 400 times.\x0e\0\x04\0It gets better every time!
W1C3_53	Does that rock look like the Earth\nVellumental to you, Mario? I don't\nreally see it, to be honest.
W1C3_37	Whoa! Thanks for that, Mario.\nNow I can get back to my shop.\nIt's the local Fun, Funky, and\nFunctional accessories outlet!\x0e\0\x04\0I'm set up just outside the temple.\nCome see me if you need any\naccessories, OK?
W1C3_48	Aww, I was just getting the hang\nof being a bug.\x0e\0\x04\0Had a great little hiding spot picked\nout to freak out the next pilgrim.
W1C3_49	You know, I read a book about\nthis once.\x0e\0\x04\0Somehow I still didn't feel prepared\nfor it when it happened to me.
W1C3_55	Hey, that other giant crashing\nsound? Wasn't me.
W1C3_56	Whoa, the exhibit keeps going?\nI'm really getting my coins' worth!
W1C3_57	That wasn't a good sound!\nDid something just collapse?!
W1C3_59	Is this whole place gonna collapse?\nFold me back into a cockroach so\nI can survive!
W1C3_60	I'll need to report this to my\nboss, you know.\x0e\0\x04\0Come to think of it, the boss\nhas been away for an incredibly\nlong time...
W1C3_62	I think that collapse must have\nsent my boss into shock!
W1C3_71	Hey! Didn't anyone ever teach\nyou not to step on the gods?!
W1C3_72	You step on our god, you get a\ndivine punishment!
W1C3_73	Hey! I'm worshippin' here!
W1C3_74	Shh! The Earth Vellumental is\nnapping. Even our divine overlord\nneeds its beauty rest.
W1C3_75	Blessed art thou, Earth Vellumental,\nhollow be thy shell...
W1C3_76	Oh, Earth Vellumental, grant me\nwisdom, serenity, and super-sharp\nclaws. I've always wanted some.
W1C3_70	Whoa...I can almost feel the power\nsurging beneath my feet...
W1C3_30	Shh! I'm hoping that my fingernails\nwill grow into glorious, formidable\nclaws like the Earth Vellumental!
W1C3_31	*rattle, rattle ra-rattle*\n(I keep knockin' on the rock for\ngood luck but my luck's still on\nthe rocks...)
W1C3_69	I'm outta coins so now I can't\nsee the pretty lights anymore...
W1C3_79	Thanks, Mario! I can't get enough\nof those beautiful lights!
W1C3_5	Whoa! You knocked the Earth\nVellumental completely over!\x0e\0\x04\0Um...do you think we'll be cursed\nnow? What's the usual punishment\nfor messing up a divine site...
W1C3_93	Huh?! Is it just me, or is it super\ndrafty all of a sudden?
W1C3_90	Ah! The cave keeps going!\x0e\0\x04\0Ooh, I can't wait to see what's\nahead. It's like a behind-the-scenes\ntour. So exciting!
W1C3_64	Ooh. Look at that!
W1C3_20	That's WAY more impressive than\nanything we've seen so far.\x0e\0\x04\0I want to climb inside that thing's\nmouth. Is that weird?\x0e\0\x04\0Let's do it anyway!
W1C3_42	By the way, I hope this doesn't jinx\nus, but I feel like we haven't seen\nany Folded Soldiers for a while.
W1C3_51	Eek! It's like I summoned them!
W1C3_46	\x0e\x03\x02\0Oh, thank you! I can't tell you\nhow long I've been trapped in\nhere... I'm actually the curator of\nthis exhibit, you see.\x0f\x03\x02\x0e\0\x04\0\x0e\x03\x02\0I realized that the divine image I\ncrafted from my imagination alone\nwas a bit...lacking...so I came here\nin search of the real thing.\x0f\x03\x02\x0e\0\x04\0\x0e\x03\x02\0Yes, I admit the exhibit is a bit of a\ncoin grab, but did I deserve to be\nfolded so harshly by those Swoops?\x0f\x03\x02\x0e\0\x04\0\x0e\x03\x02\0Eh, probably. Anyway, be careful\non your way out, Mario!\x0f\x03\x02
W1C3_50	The divine image collapsed!\nIs it taking a nap?!
W1C3_26	Whoa! Mario, these traps are\nactually on fire!\x0e\0\x04\0Please be careful, OK? If you get\nhurt, I hope you remember that you\ncan press  to use a healing item.
W1C3_18	That was close! You're already\npretty flat, but that thing would\nhave REALLY flattened you.\x0e\0\x04\0Aw, but I should have known\nyou'd figure out a way to get\npast it safely. Nice one!
W1C3_61	We made it! OK, Vellumental\nStatue...we're heading into your\nmouth. I hope you brushed your\nholy teeth!
W1C3_84	Wait, it's just a big empty hole?!\nHow disappointing!\x0e\0\x04\0Where's the Earth Vellumental?\nWe've come so far to see you!
W1C3_6	Hold on... What's that?
W1C3_19	You should really see this for\nyourself. Come take a look!
W1C3_8	So I'm not the best judge of\nfooting, as we've just learned...\x0e\0\x04\0Sorry, Mario. I'd teach you how\nto float if I could.
W1C3_52	Anyway, I was looking down at\nthis odd green spot before you\nfell down.\x0e\0\x04\0What do you think it is?
W1C3_9	It's the Earth Vellumental!\nAnd it's made of...origami?!
W1C3_67	Eeeek! It's so...cool!
W1C3_10	Oh no... I don't think it's very\nfriendly right now. Maybe because\nit got all folded up.\x0e\0\x04\0When it's like this, I'm afraid we\nmay have no choice but to fight it!
W1C3_11	Huh?! Did it just shrink down\ninto something tiny?
W1C3_87	Did you somehow turn the Earth\nVellumental into a book, Mario?!
W1C3_12	Ooh! It's instructions for folding\ninto the Earth Vellumental itself!
W1C3_14	Aww...maybe this is its way of\nhelping us.
W1C3_85	Let's see...\x0e\0\x04\0Ah, yes. A mountain fold here,\na valley fold there...
W1C3_86	Whoa!\x0e\0\x04\0I just have this strange feeling...like\nthe spirit of the Earth Vellumental\nis inside me.
W1C3_88	Ah! Maybe we should try using\nthat Magic Circle.
W1C3_80	How do I look? Powerful? Imposing?\nMagnificent? Maybe even a li'l cute?\nIt's like I'm the Earth Vellumental!
W1C3_77	I definitely feel powerful...\nLike I could really shake\nthings up in here!\x0e\0\x04\0All right, you know what?
W1C3_66	\x0e\x02\0\0{s[150]}I'm gonna dance it out!{s[100]}\x0f\x02\0
W1C3_68	Go, Olivia!
W1C3_13	What came over me? It was so fun\nto wield all of that turtle power...\x0e\0\x04\0I guess I can use any Magic Circle\nthat belongs to the Earth\nVellumental now.\x0e\0\x04\0Hey, that means I should be able\nto lower the tower back to a\nreasonable but still scary height!
W1C4.msbt
W1C4_36	Whoa, look at the size of\nthose mushrooms!\x0e\0\x04\0And that banana! That could\nfeed an army!\x0e\0\x04\0Wait...there's something off about\nthem, isn't there?\x0e\0\x04\0Oh, they're just drawings. Flat as\npaper! Sorry if I got your mouth\nwatering there, Mario.
W1C4_68	Yikes! That's one of the biggest\nholes we've seen, isn't it?\x0e\0\x04\0It looks like you'll need plenty of\nconfetti to fix it up, I'm afraid.
W1C4_1	Eeeek! The door is stuck all of a\nsudden! What could be making it\nstick like that?\x0e\0\x04\0Now WE'LL be sticking around for\na while, I guess.\x0e\0\x04\0Maybe we should try heading to\nthe top of the tower for now.
W1C4_17	I hate being stuck behind sticks.
W1C4_37	Hey, you fixed that huge hole!
W1C4_40	Oh my gosh. It's my brother's face!
W1C4_46	This one I could tell was a drawing\nright away. It is really well-done,\nthough.\x0e\0\x04\0It must have been the same artist\nwho drew the banana and the\nmushrooms.
W1C4_52	Wait! That means...
W1C4_53	Whoever drew this knows my\nbrother. I don't know how, but\nthere's no other explanation.
W1C4_45	No! You're ripping me! There's\ngot to be a better way!
W1C4_15	Ahh, that's better. Welcome to\nOverlook Tower, Mario! "The tower\nwith a gift shop." We're still working\non that slogan.\x0e\0\x04\0\x0e\x01\x01\0Annnd it looks like we've got\nsome major cleaning to do as well.\x0e\0\x04\0\x0e\x01\x01\0This artwork isn't bad, mind you,\nbut every time I see it I'll think of\nthat...monster...that attacked us.\x0e\0\x04\0It was horrible. A thin, rattling body\nwith a huge mouth filled with all\nmanner of fangs... *shudder*
W1C4_59	You think a monster did this?\x0e\0\x04\0I didn't know my brother was friends\nwith monsters! Because it has to be\nsomeone who knows his face.\x0e\0\x04\0Well, I know you're scared, but Mario\nis here now! That means there's\nnothing to fear. Right, Mario?
W1C4_5	Heyyy...could you humor me\nfor just a second?
W1C4_6	Ahem.
W1C4_3	Now passing the third floor!\nCosmetics, handbags, men's slacks,\noranges, perfume, and camping gear.
W1C4_58	Next stop—fourth floor! Bicycles,\nmattresses, formal wear, blenders,\nand comic books.
W1C4_18	How'd I do?\x0e\0\x04\0I've always wanted to be an\nelevator operator in one of\nthose fancy department stores...\x0e\0\x04\0I'm actually not too clear about\nwhat a fancy department store is,\nbut it sounds fun, right?\x0e\0\x04\0Mind if I do the same thing in \nreverse on the way down?
W1C4_4	Whoa! That was way too close!\x0e\0\x04\0What are these sticks...making\nus stuck?!\x0e\0\x04\0Ooh, they've positively RUINED my\ndepartment store fantasy. Unless...
W1C4_115	Dearest elevator passengers, there\nwill be a slight delay while my friend\nMario takes care of this emergency.\x0e\0\x04\0(Pssst! Do something, Mario!)
W1C4_23	\x0e\x02\0\0\x0e\x03\x02\0GOING DOOOOOWN!\x0f\x03\x02\x0f\x02\0
W1C4_38	Owww...\x0e\0\x04\0...First floor, absolutely flattened\nprincesses, crushed dreams,\nbroken glass, and athletic wear.
W1C4_71	Uh...remember what happened\nlast time we took the elevator?\nLet's stick to the stairs.
W1C4_89	Mario! The elevator is broken!\nI can float and I'm still scared\nto try it again.
W1C4_72	Oh no... Not these stairs too!\nAnd I can't imagine you have\nmuch confetti right now...\x0e\0\x04\0Do you think we can even find\nenough confetti in here to fix them?
W1C4_192	Hey, uh, I couldn't help\noverhearing...and I might\nbe able to help...
W1C4_203	Something real bad is going on at\nmy restaurant right now. I don't\neven want to say it out loud.
W1C4_204	We had a little, uh, situation in the\nkitchen. More of an infestation if\nyou know what I mean.
W1C4_205	I'm the head chef, but I really can't\nshow my face until it's cleared up.\x0e\0\x04\0Can you help me? Take care of\nthe problem, keep it on the down\nlow, and I'll make it up to you.
W1C4_194	How can I tell that I've still got a\nproblem? A chef can tell! Come find\nme when it's...cleared up.
W1C4_196	How can I tell that I've still got a\nproblem? A chef can tell! Come find\nme when it's...cleared up.
W1C4_185	Hmm... I don't hear the pitter-patter\nof little pests anymore. You did it!
W1C4_191	Here, I hope you enjoy this finely\nchopped confetti. Bon app\xe9tit!

W1C4_73	You're going to come back and\npay for that later, aren't you?
W1C4_20	Locked out! It doesn't look like\npushing will open it.\x0e\0\x04\0But how can we get to the top\nif we can't get in there?
W1C4_94	Ack! Another one of those sticks!
W1C4_21	They just keep coming!\nWe've got to get out of here!
W1C4_32	Huh?! Is there something on\nmy face?\x0e\x01\0\x04\xf4\x01\0\0\x0e\x01\x01\0
W1C4_42	It won't open!
W1C4_54	Oh, you have to push from THERE to open it!
W1C4_99	The hammer isn't working!
W1C4_55	Eeee! C'mon, c'mon...
W1C4_56	So many sticks! Is this the same\nspot where we were attacked on\nthe elevator?
W1C4_7	There's the end of the streamer!\x0e\0\x04\0And that's my brother's face right\nin the middle. He's really making\nsure everyone knows this was him.
W1C4_51	Should we try to detach it\nsomehow? Ooh! Maybe if you\njumped into it from below?
W1C4_95	It's a nice view, but shouldn't\nwe do something about the\nstreamer first?
W1C4_90	Hmm. Is that the most powerful\njump you can do?
W1C4_60	Yikes! That was way too close.\nI wish those sticks would stick\nto their own business!
W1C4_61	\x0e\x03\x03\0Aw, man! You were almost out\nof the picture...for good.\x0f\x03\x03

That's what I thought. Mario\nis tough and he's got a mustache\nand he's gonna mess you up!\x0e\0\x04\0...Right, Mario?

W1C4_11	I've been on the wrong end of\nthat for WAY too long. Move over!\nIt's my turn for the view!
W1C4_62	Can you just, like, use the other\none or something? I can't get\nenough of this!
W1C4_12	That was amazing! And we both\ndid something!\x0e\0\x04\0Hey, like I said before...we DO make\na pretty good team.
W1C4_34	Hey, it looks like your bag can hold\nmore confetti now. Confettulations!
W1C4_41	All right, that was all really exciting,\nbut we've got a lot more streamers\nto unravel.\x0e\0\x04\0Now, which color of streamer\nwere we going to head to next?
W1C4_64	Oh yeah! The blue streamer on\nthe red mountain. That's as good\na place as any.\x0e\0\x04\0Maybe even better! Because it\nlooks so pretty from here.
W1C4_82	Hey! All of those drawings by that\nColored Pencils guy are gone. Maybe\nthey disappeared when we beat him.\x0e\0\x04\0Aww...he was a bad guy, but his\nart was pretty good. Whoa! That's\na real doozy to think about!
W1C4_84	The colored-pencil missiles are gone,\nbut...I think we should wait for an\nelevator-repair Toad just to be safe.
W1C4_33	If you're looking for our world-\nfamous observation deck, it's\non the fourth floor.\x0e\0\x04\0But please be careful!
W1C4_35	I'd say the elevator is broken.\nMaybe try the stairs?
W1C4_118	Welcome back to Overlook Tower.\nOur elevator is fixed! Please use it\nat your convenience.
W1C4_13	We got to know each other pretty\nwell while we were all rolled up.
W1C4_133	We were kind of cozy like that,\nbut now it's too awkward to roll\nourselves up again on purpose...
W1C4_14	Thanks, Mario! Come see me on the\nsecond floor if you get hungry—\nI work in the restaurant there!
W1C4_105	How am I supposed to get to work?\nI'm the chef's top radish cook!\nWhat if someone orders a radish?!
W1C4_106	Oh sweet! The stairs are fixed!\x0e\0\x04\0Now I can get to my...job. Where\nI...endlessly cut radishes. Yay...
W1C4_120	The restaurant's on this floor.\nI'll say one thing about the chef...\nhis food sure is "special."
W1C4_76	Don't tell my boss, but I mostly just\nstand here all day doing nothing.\nSo that attack was pretty exciting!
W1C4_165	Do you think I can put "Mario saved\nme" on my r\xe9sum\xe9?
W1C4_168	Guess I'd better hurry back to the\nthird floor caf\xe9 and...get to work...
W1C4_125	Psst... I found this sitting with all\nthe construction supplies when\nthey were fixing up this place.\x0e\0\x04\0You want it? I got no use for it.
W1C4_124	Ehh, I doubt we have any customers\nyet. I'll just stand around drinking\ncoffee for a while longer...
W1C4_74	Whew. Thanks, Mario! Now I can get\nback to selling tasteful souvenirs\nand tasty items.\x0e\0\x04\0If you're in the market for either\nof those things, stop by anytime.

W1C4_159	It does make you wonder...\nCould a Toad have drawn that?\nAnd if so...with what?
W1C4_161	Goodbye, fellow pennants. Maybe\none day a hammer will kiss you\nand turn you into a Toad too.
W1C4_162	I know that they won't ever turn\ninto Toads, Mario. But can't we\nlet them hope and dream?!
W1C4_77	Whee! I haven't had that much\nfun at work in ages. Will you fold\nme back up for another ride?
W1C4_183	Oh, man. We were right in the middle\nof the lunch rush when we got hit.\nBang! Eggs and rice flying all over!\x0e\0\x04\0I'm telling you—the mess in here\nain't our fault. We run a clean\nkitchen. This never happened!
W1C4_140	I don't care if you're a busser or a\nsous chef—we all gotta pitch in to\nclean this place up again!
W1C4_155	Ayy, we're back open! And it's all\nthanks to you, Mario.\x0e\0\x04\0Why don't you take a little\nsomething on the house, eh?
W1C4_157	Maybe I should switch up the\nspecial... I gotta earn back the\npeople's trust.\x0e\0\x04\0Omelet and...MILD RICE, COOKED\nIN A KITCHEN THAT HAS PASSED\nTHE HEALTH INSPECTION. Yeah...
W1C4_79	Thanks for that, Mario.\x0e\0\x04\0Just a tip—I wouldn't order anything\nfrom the kitchen after the state\nthose Folded Soldiers left it in.
W1C4_83	Thanks for that, Mario. I went and\nfolded myself into that tight spot\nbefore they could fold me up.
W1C4_186	We're back open! And you'll never\npay for a meal in this tower as long\nas I work here, Mario.
W1C4_47	Whew! Thought for sure I was\ngonna be someone's breakfast.
W1C4_134	This place is a disaster and I just\nknow I'll have to clean it up.\nLife was easier as an egg...
W1C4_135	You've got to get all of those...\nthings...Mario!\x0e\0\x04\0Do you know how bad it looks\nto have them crawling around\nin a kitchen?
W1C4_169	Hey, I'm not the chef. I'm sous chef\nto the sous chef.\x0e\0\x04\0...OK, I'm the dishwasher. OK, I'm\nthe sous dishwasher.
W1C4_141	Oh, thank you for that.\nFun fact—I weigh as much\nas a single carrot!
W1C4_153	If I ate a carrot, would I weigh\nas much as two carrots?
W1C4_143	It doesn't count as tidying if you\njust throw everything into one drawer!
W1C4_151	Everything is back in its place.\nMy job here is done.
W1C4_145	Oh, that was horrible. I was\nbeginning to compost!
W1C4_152	...Do I smell like compost?
W1C4_147	One of those folded things threw\nme behind its back, off of the wall,\noff of the CEILING, then right into\nthat thing.\x0e\0\x04\0...It was actually an amazing shot.
W1C4_154	...This is actually an amazing meal.
W1C4_149	This place is slightly messier\nthan usual!
W1C4_150	You've gotta contain those THINGS,\nMario! A restaurant like THIS can't\nhave things like THAT crawling in it!
W1C4_91	Is that supposed to be me?
W1C4_16	What was the artist thinking?\nI'm a Blue Toad, not a Red Toad!
W1C4_107	Ah, sorry. I shouldn't be complaining\nto you, least of all after you just\nrescued me.\x0e\0\x04\0Here, let me make it up to you.
W1C4_92	Do I really look like that?\nI want another portrait!
W1C4_113	Am I...not seeing things? I'm pretty\nsure there was a middling drawing\nof a Red Toad on the wall before...
W1C4_110	Oh, I didn't see you there.\nI'm not seeing a lot of things\nthese days, it seems.\x0e\0\x04\0Here, take this before it disappears\nbefore my very eyes.
W1C4_163	I wasn't happy with that portrait...\nand then it just disappeared!\x0e\0\x04\0I think I can make things disappear\nwith my mind, Mario!
W1C4_50	Oh, man... I thought for sure they'd\nthrow me out with all of the other\nbroken pencil bits. Thank you!
W1C4_48	This is the top level of the tower,\nbut I swear those colored pencil\nthings came flying down from above!
W1C4_128	Here's where I'd normally say\n"Welcome to the Overlook Tower\nobservation deck! Enjoy the view!"\x0e\0\x04\0I guess I can still say it...and you\ncan still enjoy it... But I'm not\ngonna like it!
W1C4_127	Welcome to the Overlook Tower\nobservation deck lobby. Don't miss\nthe telescopes on the actual deck!

W1G1_OP3	\x0e\x01\x03\x04\x01\0\0\0Isn't this great, Bro? Back on the\nroad again together and heading\nto some kind of festival!\x0e\0\x04\0\x0e\x01\x01\0What did the invitation say again?\nAn Origami Festival? What's that\ngonna be like?\x0e\0\x04\0And I can't wait to say hello to\nPrincess Peach! It's-a been a while.
W1G1_OP6	\x0e\x01\x03\x04\x01\0\0\0Here we are. Toad Town!\nAnd there's Peach's Castle.
W1G1_OP7	\x0e\x01\x03\x04\x01\0\0\0...Where is everybody? You don't\nthink we missed it, do you?\x0e\0\x04\0Mario! Check the invitation again!\nWhen were we supposed to be here?
W1G1_OP9	\x0e\x01\x03\x04\0\0\0\0You are invited to an Origami\nFestival in fabulous Toad Town!\nDate: ◯◯/\xd7\xd7             -Peach
W1G1_OP10	\x0e\x01\x03\x04\x01\0\0\0Well, it's the right day! You think\nthey're still getting things ready?\x0e\0\x04\0Let's-a go check the castle.\nMaybe everyone's inside.
W1G1_2	\x0e\x03\x02\0\x0e\x02\0\0Fresh paper alert...\x0f\x02\0\x0f\x03\x02
W1G1_215	\x0e\x03\x02\0\x0e\x02\0\0Let's fold him up!\x0f\x02\0\x0f\x03\x02
W1G1_114	We're saved! What were those\nGoombas doing, kidnapping us?\nAnd where were they taking us?
W1G1_173	Were they even Goombas?\nThey were folded in a really\noff-putting way...
W1G1_174	We're taking an L on this one,\nguys—we got rescued by Mario.\nBut...you know what?\x0e\0\x04\0Maybe we should put aside our\ndifferences for a while, eh? \nWe're all paper. Let's watch\neach other's backs!
W1G1_188	All right, guys! Let's fight folds\nwith stacks. Move it out!
W1G1_115	It looks like my brother really is\nturning all kinds of paper folks\ninto an army of Folded Soldiers...\x0e\0\x04\0At this rate, it feels like the whole\nworld is going to be overrun with\nthem!
W1G1_182	Hrm? It doesn't look like there's\nanyone here.
W1G1_166	Oh, look at that big hollow spot\nover there!\x0e\0\x04\0That means my brother might have\nbeen here already...and I'm sure he\nwas up to no good.
W1G1_172	Hold on... There IS someone here!
W1G1_18	Are my eyes playing tricks on me,\nor is that creature way, WAY too\nbig to be real?\x0e\0\x04\0It's not like any origami I've ever\nseen before... And what exactly\nis it doing to that house?
W1G1_162	\x0e\x02\0\0{s[150]}It's eating it?!{s[100]}\x0f\x02\0
W1G1_191	Ewww! It's eating the house!\nI can't imagine how yucky it\nmust taste.\x0e\0\x04\0These macho, papery things must\nbe the source of the holes we've\nbeen seeing everywhere. Ugh!
W1G1_19	Wait! Look at that thing's back...\nThat's a seal of my brother's face!\x0e\0\x04\0That might mean my brother is\npowering it somehow!
W1G1_20	If that's the case...that seal could\nbe some kind of weak point!\x0e\0\x04\0Maybe if you hit the seal it will\nget weaker somehow. And then\nyou could take it down!
W1G1_92	Aim for the seal!
W1G1_298	Good shot! It's working!
W1G1_93	Yes! That did the trick.\x0e\0\x04\0So the weak point on that Paper\nMacho Soldier was my brother's\nseal. You should remember that!
W1G1_151	Now...what were we doing here?\nI'm all turned around after that\nexcitement.\x0e\0\x04\0Oh, right! We were looking for the\nplace where Peach's Castle used\nto be.
W1G1_169	Well, the gate is right over there.\nWe might as well check it out.
W1G1_170	Keep that hammer ready in case\nwe run into more of those huge\nmonsters, OK?
W1G1_140	You're just going to leave that...\nthing...to eat some poor Toad's\nhouse?!
W1G1_143	Try to land one good hammer shot\non the little sticker on that thing's\nback, Mario!
W1G1_148	That did something! Maybe now\nit's vulnerable to hammer strikes\nanywhere on its icky body!

W1G1_102	Hey, thanks for that! I owe you one.\nOoh, but I can pay you back right\nnow with information!\x0e\0\x04\0If you're trying to get to Peach's\nCastle, you can take the sewer\nover there.
W1G1_103	Just get down in the sewer over\nthere if you're trying to get to the\ncastle. It's a pretty nice sewer!
W1G1_107	Oh, I forgot to mention that you\nneed a special manhole hook to\nget down there.\x0e\0\x04\0I think my friend is using it right\nnow. Just look for a Red Shy Guy\nlike me, but not quite as handsome.
W1G1_109	Yeah, my friend definitely has\nthe hook to open the manhole.\x0e\0\x04\0Would you believe that guy's even\nmore into sewers than I am?
W1G1_153	I just realized that my buddy has\nhad the sewer hook all day. What\na sewer hog!
W1G1_106	I don't think that's going to\nwork here.
W1G1_179	Save me!
W1G1_180	I'm over here!
W1G1_167	Yes! Keep doing that!
W1G1_299	You're doing it!
W1G1_168	Almost there...
W1G1_187	Don't get a game over before you save me!
W1G1_28	If anyone could defeat the world's\nlargest and most disgusting Goomba,\nI knew it'd be you, Mario.
W1G1_129	I came here to deliver dinner, and\nin a weird way that's exactly what\nI did.\x0e\0\x04\0But Red Shy Guy is off the menu\nthanks to you, Mario! I really\nowe you one.
W1G1_118	Hold on... You're red! Just like \nthat other Shy Guy and nearly\nas handsome!\x0e\0\x04\0So do you have the thing we\nneed to open up the sewer lid?
W1G1_83	I don't know what you're talking\nabout, but that hook isn't here.\x0e\0\x04\0Check out the red brick building\nat the port—that's where I left it.
W1G1_94	I'm not getting any handsomer,\nand you're not getting that hook\nunless you go to the brick building\nby the port, OK?
W1G1_119	Oh! Thank you! Should we go check\nit out, Mario?
W1G1_120	You found it, right? I told you.\x0e\0\x04\0Now...you're probably wondering\nwhy I left the hook there if I'm\nalways going in the sewer, right?\x0e\0\x04\0I was trying to break open a box\nof snacks, OK? I like snacks and I\nlike sewers. DON'T JUDGE ME!
W1G1_34	Oh! Whew. I thought you might\nbe one of those hideous folded\nguys or something.
W1G1_130	What ARE those folded things,\nanyway? I've been hiding in here\nsince the moment I saw one.
W1G1_131	You think something's in there?\nCould be. Seemed like those\nfolded guys were messing around\nin here forever!
W1G1_135	You wanna look around for snacks\nor whatever? Those folded guys\nmighta hid something on the shelf.\nLook around, be my guest!
W1G1_132	Whoa! That hammer of yours sure\ncan shake things up. Did those\nboxes just move?
W1G1_30	Hit it again!
W1G1_31	Keep doing that!
W1G1_217	Watch the hair!
W1G1_218	C'mon, keep hitting it. I was\nstarting to enjoy the show!
W1G1_193	Hey, look at that.
W1G1_134	If there are snacks on the other\nside of that door, you gotta give\nme some. Finder's fee.
W1G1_67	I'll spare you the details, but\nknow this. I am a Snifit. And I\nwas INSIDE that Goomba.\x0e\0\x04\0Do you have any idea what it\nwas like in there?\x0e\0\x04\0Never mind. Just take this, and\ntry to forget what happened\nto me.
W1G1_72	Think nothing of that gift. It's a\nmere trinket.\x0e\0\x04\0After all, this home was built with\nthe proceeds from a lucrative\nconfetti sales operation. There are\nbig coins in the confetti business!\x0e\0\x04\0Come see me anytime, and I will sell\nyou the finest luxury confetti you've\never had the pleasure of scattering.
W1G1_74	You want some confetti?\n300 coins, bub.\x0e\x01\x04\x1c\x12\0y\0e\0s\0n\0o\0_\0b\0u\0y\0\x01\0\0\0\0\0\0\0

W1G1_78	Catch!
W1G1_79	One more!
W1G1_80	Come back whenev.
W1G1_123	Ah, Mario! Thanks again for helping\nwith that nasty business back in\nShroom City.\x0e\0\x04\0I owe you one! Please feel free to\npick these up at your leisure.
W1G1_126	As an additional sign of gratitude,\nI have unlocked all of the doors\nin my fabulous manse.
W1G1_125	By all means, explore the grounds of\nmy \x0e\x01\x03\x04\x04\0\0\0{s[120]}ENORMOUS{s[100]}\x0e\x01\x03\x04\xff\xff\xff\xff house as you like.
W1G1_124	Ah, hello again, Mario. It seems\nI am once again in your debt.\nYou rescued my loyal employee!\x0e\0\x04\0Now then, allow me to offer you\na good deal on confetti. It's the\nleast I can do.
W1G1_95	In need of confetti, are we?\nIt'll be 300 coins.\x0e\x01\x04\x1c\x12\0y\0e\0s\0n\0o\0_\0b\0u\0y\0\x01\0\0\0\0\0\0\0

W1G1_99	Hyaah!
W1G1_100	Hup!
W1G1_101	Gather them!
W1G1_138	Come back anytime. I own 99\npercent of the confetti supply.
W1G1_139	Ah...yeah...\n...That's my boss.
W1G1_249	Those horrible giant Goombas\nshowed up right around the time\nthe Toads disappeared.\x0e\0\x04\0I heard loud noises coming from\nPeach's Castle too. Just what\nis going on?
W1G1_276	Oh, you thought I was a Red Shy\nGuy? Well, sorry to disappoint,\nbut I'm a Snifit!
W1G1_347	Well, all of the Toads are back.\nGuess the line for the sewer is\ngonna be out of control again...

W1G1_104	Hey, we made it to the entrance\nof Peach's Castle! That sewer really\nis pretty neat!
W1G1_105	I mean...I suppose we shouldn't\ncelebrate just yet.\x0e\0\x04\0We need to see if your poor \nbrother's green hat is OK. And\nyour brother too!
W1G1_23	Hmm, what's all that?\x0e\0\x04\0Did that pile of junk come flying\nout of the castle when my brother\ntook it? How dangerous!
W1G1_163	It looks pretty heavy. I don't think\nwe'll be able to move it ourselves.
W1G1_220	Your brother's hat!
W1G1_221	Hmm, someone wrote "Luigi" on\nthe inside in very small letters...\nIs that something Luigi would do?\x0e\0\x04\0Where could he be, Mario?

W1G1_229	\x0e\x01\x03\x04\x03\0\0\0...Um...
W1G1_230	Oh, poor Luigi. I'm sure he's met\nwith a really bad fate thanks to\nmy brother.\x0e\0\x04\0Mario...can I keep this hat as a\nmemory? I didn't know Luigi, but\nI miss him anyway...\x0e\0\x04\0It's too bad it has to be this way,\nbut we can't let it get us down.\nWe will hold and treasure your\nhat forever, Luigi!
W1G1_231	...Don't forget about me...\nAre you walking away?\n...M-Mario?
W1G1_233	...I'm so close, Bro...
W1G1_232	\x0e\x01\x03\x04\x02\0\0\0Don't leave me here! You wouldn't\nbe that cruel...would you?
W1G1_295	Am I saved? I feel weird!
W1G1_296	My mustache is wrapped around\nmy own neck!
W1G1_155	Whew! That's-a more like it.
W1G1_156	I'm so glad you're OK, Luigi.\n...Not that we had any doubt...\x0e\0\x04\0My name's Olivia, by the way.\nI owe Mario big-time for all of\nhis help.\x0e\0\x04\0By the way, as someone who's been\nthere, I'm wondering how you ended\nup trapped between dimensions...
W1G1_158	Let's see...a Shy Guy put me there!\nBut not a regular Shy Guy.\nIt was...thick...and edgy...\x0e\0\x04\0Before I knew it, it had folded me\nup and tucked me away in there.\nSaid it'd come back for me later!
W1G1_294	How awful for you. But at least\nyou didn't get turned into a\nFolded Soldier...\x0e\0\x04\0Oh! But I do have some good news.\nYour hat survived without you.
W1G1_235	My hat?! But what happened\nto the whole castle?\x0e\0\x04\0And where's Princess Peach?
W1G1_236	Aww, I thought you'd be happier\nto see the hat. Well, my brother\nkidnapped Peach and her castle.\x0e\0\x04\0We're on our way to stop him right\nnow, but it's a long way and there \nare streamers blocking us.
W1G1_238	Oh! That's right! I was gonna go\nlook for the key to Peach's Castle.\nWe got locked in, remember?\x0e\0\x04\0Mario's always saving me...so I just\nwanted to do something nice for\nhim for a change.
W1G1_287	I'm really happy to see my hat\nagain...but I've still gotta find\nthat key. Let's-a go!
W1G1_297	Well...we definitely might need the\nkey if we make it to the castle. So\nlet's pin all our hopes on Luigi!
W1G1_239	Good luck, Luigi! See you later!
W1G1_240	...I do need the hat.
W1G1_242	Well, now that we know he's OK,\nwhat should we do next?\x0e\0\x04\0I mean, we're still headed to\nPeach's Castle, but should we\nlook around here for clues first?
W1G1_116	Oh, someone moved that pile of\njunk that was here!\x0e\0\x04\0It was probably Luigi, wasn't it?\nI wish my brother were as kind\nand thoughtful as yours...
W1G1_24	Oh, I think we found the castle.\nIt's right there!\x0e\0\x04\0But I don't know how we're going\nto make it past those streamers.\nThey're weirdly strong for paper!\x0e\0\x04\0Plus, it looks like they're coming from\ndifferent places. Will we have to go\nall over the world to unravel them?
W1G1_36	So if the red streamer is going in\nthis direction...\x0e\0\x04\0It seems like following it will lead us\nwhere we need to go, doesn't it?
W1G1_85	Somebody...help me!\x0e\0\x04\0I'm in between dimensions!
W1G1_147	Hey! It sounds like someone nearby\nis in the same kind of jam I was in\nearlier. Should we help them?
W1G1_86	In case I wasn't clear—I don't\nlike it in here! Help!
W1G1_141	Isn't that a voice calling for help?\nAre we going to ignore it?
W1G1_41	Oh, whew. Thank you so much! Now\nI can get back to my shop in Toad\nTown. I hate to be away for more\nthan a few minutes, you see.\x0e\0\x04\0It's a big problem and I'm working\non my control issues...but we have\nweapons, items, and all sorts of\nuseful things. Stop by!
W1G1_90	Aw, man! The bridge didn't used\nto be all broken like this! How am\nI supposed to get back to my shop?!
W1G1_97	This is fine. This is fine. This is fine.\nTHIS IS FINE. I'm not losing it about\nthe bridge being disconnected...
W1G1_142	Are we just going to leave him here?\nIt seems like he REALLY wants to\nget back to his shop.
W1G1_91	Oh my gosh oh my gosh oh my gosh...\nYou fixed it! Thank you!\x0e\0\x04\0I'm literally going to sprint over\nto my shop now, but first, here's\na free sample of my wares. Enjoy!
W1G1_112	I'm off! Gotta put out the fire that\nI assume is burning down my shop\nbecause I wasn't there!
W1G1_Shop_03	Hey, remember me? You pulled me\nback from another dimension so I\ncan work 18-hour days in this shop!\x0e\0\x04\0Can't thank you enough for that.\nAnyway, we've got some good items\nand weapons here. Check it out!
W1G1_209	I just had a thought... Do you\nremember rescuing a Toad who said\nsomething about a Battle Lab?\x0e\0\x04\0I don't know where it is, but maybe\nwe should try to find it. I think there\nwas a free gift mentioned!
W1G1_208	Awoooo—I mean, woooo! It's you!\nRemember me? I'm the Battle Lab\nToad you rescued a while ago.\x0e\0\x04\0I guess that makes me a Battle Lab\nlab, in a way. I mean, if I had been\na Labrador, which I wasn't.\x0e\0\x04\0Um... I'm kind of better at training\nthan talking. Why don't you come\non in and I'll show you?
W1G1_200	Yes! You came! Welcome to the\nBattle Lab.\x0e\0\x04\0Now that we're under threat from\nthose folded freaks, my setup may\nbe of some use to you.\x0e\0\x04\0You'll find the absolute latest\ntechnology, precisely engineered\nto develop your fighting skills.\nNo towel service, though.\x0e\0\x04\0Oh! But I told you about the\nmembership drive, right?\nHere's your free gift!
W1G1_201	You know how to use that thing,\nright? Just keep it on you...and if\nthe going gets really tough, it'll\ngive you a second chance.\x0e\0\x04\0If you need more, check out the\nlocal shop, OK?
W1G1_311	Hey, welcome back, Mario! I've been\nwaiting to show you something new.
W1G1_206	It's called the Timer Extender!\x0e\0\x04\0Are you tired of the ol' battle timer\nhitting zero before you're finished\nlining up your enemies?\x0e\0\x04\0Well, this doodad will automatically\npull some of your coins to bump that\ntimer back up once per turn!\x0e\0\x04\0It even has a "bankruptcy blocker"\nfunction that lets you set a cap on\nthe amount of coins it pulls.
W1G1_308	I call it...the Puzzle Solver!\x0e\0\x04\0You ever find some of these battle\npuzzles a bit TOO tricky? Honestly,\nwho wouldn't?\x0e\0\x04\0Use this machine to spot the best,\nuh, spot for enemy placement with\na big ol' {c[cf2c12]}〇{c[404040]} symbol! Puzzle SOLVED!\x0e\0\x04\0You don't even have to spend coins\nor anything! It just works and works\nand works. Talk about a good deal!
W1G1_309	You can set it up by opening the\nmenu with  and turning it {c[cf2c12]}On{c[404040]}\nwith ⚙.\x0e\0\x04\0No thanks necessary, Mario. I'm just\nhappy to be helping a real hero!
W1G1_306	Go on—try out any machine you\nlike. You're not gonna break 'em!
W1G1_281	Ah, the hammer training machine.\nGood choice!\x0e\0\x04\0It'll teach you how to perfectly\ntime your hammer attacks...and\ntotally shred your lats.
W1G1_282	Going for the boots training\nmachine? Good idea!\x0e\0\x04\0Anyone can squash a Goomba, but\nafter you use this machine, you'll be\ntiming those jump attacks like a pro.
W1G1_283	Ah, getting some guard work in.\nGreat thinking!\x0e\0\x04\0If you can't beat 'em, at least\nminimize the damage they're\ndoing while they pulverize you!
W1G1_284	Ah, that's the ring training machine.\x0e\0\x04\0You ever get in a scuffle with some\nFolded Soldiers and you panic and\nline 'em up all weird?\x0e\0\x04\0Well, here's your chance to work\non that! And no one will attack\nyou if you don't get it right.\x0e\0\x04\0You've got two modes to try. There's\nyour basic The Ringer mode, with\n10 problems to solve per level...\x0e\0\x04\0And Speed Rings mode, where you\nget \x0e\x03\0\x04\0\0\0\0 seconds to clear as many\nenemy lineups as you can.
W1G1_285	Ah, that one's not fully installed\nyet. But you're gonna love it when\nit's all done!\x0e\0\x04\0It's a VR boss-battle machine!\nCome talk to me after you take\nout a boss and I'll explain more.
W1G1_286	Ah, this one's finally ready for\nyou. The question is...are you\nready for IT?!\x0e\0\x04\0Yep, this baby is the latest in VR.\nIt's called the Bossotronic Animated\nMachine Fighter, or just Bossotronic\nFighter for short.\x0e\0\x04\0Once you step into this bad boy,\nit's like you're stepping right back\ninto a boss fight. But this time, you\nwon't get a game over if you lose.\x0e\0\x04\0You'll have the same kind of items\nand be about as strong as you\nwere the first time around. It's\ncrazy immersive!\x0e\0\x04\0Anyway, go nuts in there if you\nwant. If you can take out all the\nbosses a second time, there's even\nsome kind of prize!
W1G1_Btl_20	Too late!
W1G1_Btl_21	Too early!
W1G1_Btl_22	Perfect!
W1G1_Btl_35	Wanna do some boots attack\ntraining?\x0e\x01\x04\x14\n\0y\0e\0s\0n\0o\0\x01\0\0\0\0\0\0\0

W1G1_Btl_42	Hey, I've got something for you if\nyou can beat all of the Bossotronic\nAnimated Machine Fighter bosses!
W1G1_Btl_41	You wanna use the Bossotronic\nAnimated Machine Fighter?\x0e\x01\x04\x14\n\0y\0e\0s\0n\0o\0\x01\0\0\0\0\0\0\0
W1G1_288	Nicely done, Mario! To be honest,\nI wasn't even sure that was possible.\nHere, you've more than earned this!
W1G1_258	All right, Big M. Should we head\nstraight for the port?
W1G1_319	Ah, Mario! It's you!\x0e\0\x04\0Remember me? You saved me from\nthat tight flop—er—spot in Autumn\nMountain a while back.
W1G1_320	Anyway, we're just about ready\nto set sail.\x0e\0\x04\0Er...technically we'll be using an\nengine, when it's ready. Come back\nsoon and we'll...motor away.
W1G1_321	We're working as fast as we can!\nEngines are faster than sails, but a\nbit tricky, you see. Come again soon!
W1G1_203	Ah, you're back! And just in time.\nThe engine is ready.
W1G1_202	So, shall we set motor for the\nGreat Sea? {s[075]}Ugh, it just sounds wrong...{s[100]}\x0e\x01\x04\x14\n\0y\0e\0s\0n\0o\0\x01\0\0\0\0\0\0\0

W1G1_247	It sounds great! Hey, that's the\nname of the sea too!\x0e\0\x04\0We're still following that blue\nstreamer, but it couldn't hurt to\ngo on a quick cruise, right?
W1G1_253	It sounds great! Hey, that's the\nname of the sea too!\x0e\0\x04\0I'm still thinking about that yellow\nstreamer, but it couldn't hurt to\ngo on a quick cruise, right?

W1G1_Art_18	Let me tell you how it all works!\x0e\0\x04\0We collect a variety of pieces from\nyour travels and display them here\nin galleries.\x0e\0\x04\0We are fully dedicated to displaying\nartifacts from your adventure alone.\nThat's unique! That's something\nno other museum can boast!
W1G1_Art_19	Oh! And speaking of unique...\nWe are a bit light on exhibits at\nthe moment, but I do have one\nspectacular piece to share.\x0e\0\x04\0It's the Super Marino, legendary\nvessel of the legendary Khap'taan\nTeeowed!
W1G1_Art_20	Last but not least, we are more\nthan happy to display any trophies\nyou may earn in your adventures.\x0e\0\x04\0I will personally polish and shine\neach one of them in the event you\nwish to come view them.\x0e\0\x04\0You won't find THAT level of service\nin any other museum, I assure you.\nWell then, I suppose that's all for\nnow. Good luck, Mario!
W1G1_Art_16	Ah, Mario! We have some new\npieces on display. Do please view\nthem at your leisure.
W1G1_Art_17	Good day, Mario. I'm afraid we\ndo not have any new exhibits\nat the moment.
W1G1_307	New trophies...
W1G1_305	Great news, Mario! I received one\nor more of your trophies!
W1G1_301	They're already spit shined and\nproudly displayed in the Treasure\nGallery.\x0e\0\x04\0Perhaps I should have kept the\nspit part to myself...
W1G1_302	If my curator calculations are\ncorrect, the number of trophies\nyou have yet to earn is...\x0e\x03\0\x04\0\0\0\0!
W1G1_303	You've done it, Mario! You've earned\nevery possible trophy! Now that I\nhave the complete set, I can charge\ndouble the admission...\x0e\0\x04\0Finally, Mus\xe9e Champignon will take\nits rightful place among the most\nprestigious museums in the world!
W1G1_304	Whoa! I didn't know you were\nso nakedly ambitious. It's cute!
W1G1_318	Oh! Well...thank you?\x0e\0\x04\0We should really both be thanking\nMario. He's the one responsible for\nmaking my dream come true.\x0e\0\x04\0My dream of curating the most\ncomplete and expensive museum\nin the world...
W1G1_315	Congratulations!
W1G1_317	Thanks!
W1G1_314	Of course, my new admission fee\ndoesn't apply to you, Mario. You're\nfree to browse at your leisure.
W1G1_322	Huh?! I thought Captain T. Ode\nwould be here to greet us...
W1G1_324	So this is the Marino, huh?\nIt's SO COOL!\x0e\0\x04\0But where's Captain T. Ode?\nShouldn't he be here too?
W1G1_327	Captain T. Ode? You mean...\nKhap'taan Teeowed?\x0e\0\x04\0He's...he's not real, you know. It's\nall just an ancient legend. Quite\ncolorful, to be sure, but imaginary.
W1G1_325	\x0e\x03\x01\x04\xcd\xccL>Ah, my precious Marino. Still\nbeautiful. Still formidable. And yet\ntime marches on...\x0f\x03\x01
W1G1_326	Hey! The sign says no piloting\nthe Marino! You're in direct\nviolation of the sign!
W1G1_334	Hey! We were just talking\nabout you!\x0e\0\x04\0So did you find the, uh, thingy\nyou were looking for?\x0e\0\x04\0The sea chart! That's what it was\ncalled. Ooh, I hope you have it!

W1G1_348	Oh, this is gonna be SO cool.\nA submarine on a boat? Two\nfamous captains?\x0e\0\x04\0I can't wait!
W1G1_330	What about my exhibit? It's the\nstar attraction! I can't curate\nsomething else out of thin air!
W1G1_263	Easy! Keep 'er coming!
W1G1_264	All righty! You should be good to\ngo here.\x0e\0\x04\0You decide you wanna rig up a few\nmore outboots...give that vessel\nsome real oomph? You call me.
W1G1_267	\x0e\x03\x01\x04\xcd\xccL>You have my gratitude.\x0f\x03\x01\x0e\0\x04\0\x0e\x03\x01\x04\xcd\xccL>And...you may now have this.\x0f\x03\x01

W1G1_271	I must say...this whole situation\nwith Khap'taan Teeowed being real\nis what we in the museum business\ncall "completely bananas."\x0e\0\x04\0\x0e\x01\x01\0That said, there is no disputing\nthe ancient texts. The Marino is\nyours, Captain. I wish you good luck\nand Toadspeed!\x0e\0\x04\0\x0e\x01\x01\0And if you should choose to return\nto my humble museum at any time\nin the future, I will gladly offer you\na personal tour. Farewell!
W1G1_269	Well, this is gonna be super. I'm just\nso excited that you all have called\non me and my boat to help.\x0e\0\x04\0And I can't wait to see what that\nsubmarine can do. Going UNDER the\nwater? What'll they think of next?!\x0e\0\x04\0Anyway, I'm ready when you are.

W1G1_Gyotaku_Place06	And speaking of large specimens...\x0e\0\x04\0A colleague once told me that there\nare "monster" fish lurking in our local\nwaters, believe it or not.\x0e\0\x04\0If you were somehow able to procure\none of these specimens, I would be\nthrilled to display it, as always.

W1G1_ArtGal_03	Sorry, not enough Toad Points.
W1G1_KinokoTown_Clear_Orivia	Do you feel that, Mario? It feels...\ncalmer somehow around here.\x0e\0\x04\0It's almost like there aren't any\nmore giant monsters trying to\neat buildings...and us!
W1G1_KinokoTown_Clear_BOM	Whoa...does it seem extra quiet\naround here all of a sudden?\x0e\0\x04\0I think you must have wiped out\nall of those giant Paper Macho\nbaddies! Nice going, Big M!
W1G1_KinokoTown_KPN_After_01A	Welcome to Toad Town, Mario!\nEnjoy your stay!
W1G1_KinokoTown_KPN_After_02A	We're still hosting the Origami\nFestival, just as soon as we clean up\nthe devastation caused by origami.
W1G1_KinokoTown_KPN_After_03A	Apparently we're still having\nthe Origami Festival after\neverything that's happened...
W1G1_KinokoTown_KPN_After_04A	I heard that there were giant,\npapery creatures eating houses!\nI hope they didn't eat mine...\x0e\0\x04\0On second thought, I have 25\nyears left on my mortgage...
W1G1_KinokoTown_KPN_After_05A	There was supposed to be a\ngiant diorama here for the\nOrigami Festival.\x0e\0\x04\0I hope we can still use it. Ooh, but\nif we don't, maybe I could set it up\nin my living room and just hope\neveryone kinda forgets about it...
W1G1_KinokoTown_KPN_After_07C	Whoa! There's a hole in my door!\nI can't go through that hole! I need\nto go through the usual door hole!
W1G1_HouseA_KPN_After_01A	Ah, home sweet home.\nI'm never going outside again.
W1G1_KinokoTown_KPN_After_08A	Don't tell anyone else about this\nplace, OK? I'm growing organic kale\nand it's, like, a MAGNET for hipsters.
W1G1_KinokoTown_KPN_After_09A	Have you tried our luxurious Toad\nTown bench? It's just the thing\nwhen you need to rest and recover.
W1G1_KinokoTown_KPN_After_10A	This is the only rusty orange\npipe I've ever seen. What's up\nwith that, Mario? You know\nanything about pipes?
W1G1_KinokoTown_KPN_After_11A	Ooh, that's great. I need that.
W1G1_KinokoTown_KPN_After_12A	I'm not one to gossip, but there's\nsome guy living on the pier right\nnow. Might wanna check that out.
W1G1_KinokoTown_KPN_After_13A	The Great Sea is right here, and\nAutumn Mountain is just a tram\nride away.\x0e\0\x04\0That's why I live in Toad Town!\nI like being close to places that\nI'll never visit.
W1G1_StoreRoom_After_GBN_HIDE	I cleaned up a little bit.\x0e\0\x04\0Ah, fine. I was looking for snacks.\nFound 'em too.
W1G1_BackRoom_KPN_After_01A	Huh... Could've sworn I had a whole\ndelivery of mushrooms and snacks\nin here. Those darn Folded Soldiers\nmust have gotten to 'em!
W1G1_KinokoTown_KPN_After_15A	Ahh, there's nothing like a fresh\nocean breeze...\x0e\0\x04\0I need a boat.
W1G1_KinokoTown_KPN_After_17A	Where's Purple Toad?
W1G1_KinokoTown_KPN_After_16A	Where's Blue Toad?
W1G1_KinokoTown_KPN_After_21A	That huge monster is gone! I've got\nit made in the shade. I'm not moving\nfrom here until the Origami Festival!
W1G1_KinokoTown_KPN_After_19A	Don't worry—the turtle tea is made\nwith imitation turtle.\x0e\0\x04\0You can still really taste the turtle.
W1G1_KinokoTown_KPN_After_20A	Nothing like the rabbit drink to\nreally get your heart movin' like\na hummingbird. WHEEEEEE!
W1G1_KinokoTown_KPN_After_23A	I know streamers haven't had the\nbest reputation lately, but these\nare pretty cute, right?
W1G1_KinokoTown_KPN_After_24A	Can you believe a Toad can\nafford a place like that on a\nconfetti salestoad's salary?
W1G1_KinokoTown_KPN_After_25A	I hope I can afford a house with\nway more rooms than I could ever\nuse someday...
W1G1_HouseG_KPN_After_01A	I'm afraid Master Toad is still\nvacationing in the desert.
W1G1_HouseG_KPN_After_01B	Master Toad has returned from\nhis travels with a wealth of new\nexperiences to add to his wealth\nof...wealth.
W1G1_HouseG_KPN_After_03D	Nooo! My boss treats that rug\nbetter than he treats me!
W1G1_HouseG_KPN_After_03B	You just saved me. I think he\nprobably would have had me\nmade into the rug.
W1G1_HouseF_KPN_After_01A	Ahh...home sweet home. I'm gonna\nbunker down until this Origami\nFestival nonsense settles.
W1G1_KinokoTown_KPN_After_28A	Where's an expert on bridge experts\nwhen you need one?
W1G1_KinokoTown_KPN_After_29_Event_01	I can't seem to find the hook I need\nto access the sewer. Know anything\nabout it, Mario?\x0e\x01\x04\x18\x0e\0K\0e\0y\0I\0t\0e\0m\0\xff\xff\xff\xff\0\0\0\0
W1G1_KinokoTown_KPN_After_29_Event_02	Hmm, that's very interesting, but\nI don't think it's going to help us\nget into that sewer!
W1G1_KinokoTown_KPN_After_29_Event_03	Hey, you found it! I'm so relieved.\nYou wouldn't believe the kind of\ndemand we get here.\x0e\0\x04\0I don't question it—I'm just the guy\nwho opens the sewer. Anyway,\nplease take this as a reward.
W1G1_KinokoTown_KPN_After_29A	Ahh, my beautiful sewer hook.\nAlways love to see the sun glinting\noff its glorious form.
W1G1_KinokoTown_KPN_After_30A	You know why everyone around\nhere loves the sewer, right?\x0e\0\x04\0It's because of the artwork! Wait...\nwhy did you THINK everyone was\nalways lining up to go down there?
W1G1_KinokoTown_KPN_After_31A	I was creased to within an inch\nof my life, and yet I'm still weirdly\nexcited about the Origami Festival!
W1G1_HouseE_KPN_After_01A	Hey! Who got footprints all over\nmy window?!\x0e\0\x04\0It's called a DOOR, people!
W1G1_KinokoTown_KPN_After_32A	I can't believe my flowers survived\nall of that stomping around the\nmonster did...and that battle!\x0e\0\x04\0...You wouldn't, would you?
W1G1_HouseD_KPN_After_1	I thought getting a few roommates\nwould liven things up around here\na bit.\x0e\0\x04\0Don't. Just don't even say anything.
W1G1_HouseD_After_P_Kur_6	Oh, hey, Mario! Are you moving in\nhere too?
W1G1_HouseD_After_P_Kur_1	You take care of that monster\noutside for us? Not that I get\noutside much. Ha!
W1G1_HouseD_After_P_Kur_2	Wow! I've never seen such strong\npaper, Mario. Except maybe for my\nuncle Pete. He's cardboard.
W1G1_HouseD_After_P_Kur_3	Toads and Goombas, living together!\nIt's like we're total opposites!\x0e\0\x04\0Say, this gives me a great idea for\na TV show that's never been done...
W1G1_HouseD_After_P_Kur_4	Honestly? The accommodations here\nare better than in Bowser's Castle.
W1G1_HouseD_After_P_Kur_5	We stack up pretty tight so one\nbed is plenty comfy.
W1G1_HouseD_After_P_Kur_7	I ain't leavin'.
W1G1_KinokoTown_KPN_After_34A	Whoa! I had no idea there was\na pipe here. Did you? Aren't you,\nlike, Mario?
W1G1_KinokoTown_KPN_After_35A	This place is still a mess!\x0e\0\x04\0We've got to get everything all nice\nso the Origami Festival attendees\ncan wreck it again.
W1G1_KinokoTown_KPN_After_35B	All clean!
W1G1_KinokoTown_KPN_After_36A	Life is great when you're not\nworried about being crumpled\nby terrifying monsters!
W1G1_KinokoTown_KPN_After_37A	Ahh, this place was supposed to be\nbustling with business for the\nbig Origami Festival.\x0e\0\x04\0Maybe it can still bustle if we try\nhard enough. Bustle. BUSTLE, YOU!
W1G1_KinokoTown_KPN_After_38A	I'm gonna start gardening any\nminute now. I've just gotta feel\nthings out for a while first.
W1G1_HouseB_KPN_After_01A	Ah, home sweet home. Everything\njust as I left it. Think I'll just stand\nhere and bask in it for a while.
W1G1_289	Hey, Mario! It's me, the Toad you\nsaved in front of the Earth\nVellumental's temple.\x0e\0\x04\0C'mon on! I'll open up the shop\nfor you.
W1G1_HouseC_KPN_After_01C	Oh. Oh, that's disappointing.
W1G1_HouseC_KPN_After_01D	Whew! That's twice you've saved\nme now. Hope you don't need to\ndo it again, heh...
W1G1_MuseumEntrance_KPN_After_01	You're wondering about this pipe,\nright? Well let me explai— OH!\nIt's you, Mario! You already know.
W1G1_MuseumEntrance_KPN_After_02	So all of that stuff in the museum\nis from you, right? Wild.
W1G1_MuseumEntrance_KPN_After_04	Where do I even start with this\nstuff? Is there a guide book\nor something?
W1G1_ArtGallery_KPN_After_01	I should start drawing again...
W1G1_KinopioGallery_KPN_After_01	I'll hand it to those origami guys...\nSure, they're trying to destroy all\nToads, but BOY can they fold!
W1G1_EnemyGallery_KPN_After_01	Welp, those things are going to\nhaunt my dreams now. Guess I'm\nsleeping with the lights on forever!
W1G1_CollectableGallery_KPN_After_01	You've really been busy, haven't\nyou? Well, congratulations! You've\nmade our humble collection the\nvery best it can be.
W1G1_SoundGallery_KPN_After_01	Shh... Just close your eyes\nand listen.\x0e\0\x04\0A bup bup bup! No talking...
Collect_Shop_Close	Ehh? It's not ready yet!\nCome back later!
Collect_Shop_00	It's ready. Are YOU ready?\x0e\0\x04\0I got Collectible Treasures! Keep it\na secret, eh?
Collect_Shop_01	I'm workin' on somethin' else.\nCome back later.

HPMAXUP_Hint_end	Farewell, for now, I bid adieu.\nPerhaps one day we'll meet anew.\nAnd on that day you might just find\nanother hint to blow your mind!

W1G1_Ending_02	Toad Town is bustling with\nan Origami Festival...
W1G1_Ending_03	Everyone is discovering the magic\nof origami and having fun.
W1G1_Ending_04	Ah, Mario! Peach! Come take a look.\nMy masterpiece is finally finished.
W1G1_Ending_09	You see? It's a miniaturized Origami\nCastle...just like the one Olly made.
W1G1_Ending_06	Mario...are you thinking about the\norigami girl who saved me?
W1G1_Ending_07	She was so brave to do what she\ndid. We owe her everything.
W1G1_Ending_10	I just know she's with us in spirit.\nI wish I could thank her...
W1G1_Ending_08	Gather round, everyone! It's time\nfor the big finale!
W1G1_Ending_11	\x0e\x02\0\0To all the origami...\x0f\x02\0\n\x0e\x02\0\0Thank you!\x0f\x02\0
W1G2.msbt
W1G2_1	Wow, this place is really beautiful!\nNothing like bright, blooming flowers\nand abundant sunshine...
W1G2_104	In fact, it's so nice, I think we\nshould stop and have a picnic.\x0e\0\x04\0\x0e\x01\x01\0No! What am I thinking?!\x0e\0\x04\0Sorry, Mario. It's so nice here,\nI almost forgot about the streamers.\nAnd all of our other problems!
W1G2_109	I've been hiding in those leaves\nfor so long I turned green! Wait...\nis that... No, it couldn't be.\x0e\0\x04\0All right, I'm just gonna ask.\nIs that Luigi's origin story?\nAm I the Luigi of Toads?
W1G2_226	You know what? I'm gonna lean\ninto it. Gonna find a green hat,\ngrow a 'stache, work on my sneer.\x0e\0\x04\0Oh! And if Luigi were here, he'd\ntell you to try pressing  to open\nup your menu.\x0e\0\x04\0From there, you can equip weapons,\nuse items, and check out all kinds\nof helpful info. Mamma mia!\x0e\0\x04\0...Did I do that right?
W1G2_202	By the way, this area is called\nPicnic Road. It's like a picnic, get\nit? Sunshine? Grass? Greenery?\nFlowers? Just look at those flowers.
W1G2_113	Ahhh! I was just having a peaceful\npicnic when I got folded. Thanks\nfor saving me, Mario!
W1G2_112	Argh! I missed the entire picnic!
W1G2_111	I hope there's still some\npotato salad left...
W1G2_114	Don't flatten me! This is like having\na new superpower!
W1G2_110	I hope you weren't expecting a\ntreasure map or a scroll filled\nwith ancient secrets...
W1G2_115	Yes! I knew someone would come\nalong who had a compulsion about\nhitting every surface with a hammer!
W1G2_38	I bloomed three times and no one\neven noticed!
W1G2_207	Well, I'm not gonna bloom NOW!
W1G2_138	Surprise, fungus finder!
W1G2_208	Fun fact—fungi can grow anywhere!
W1G2_121	Aww... I was flying! Now I'm\njust flapping.
W1G2_205	I'll flap until I fly—you just watch!
W1G2_124	I can't keep this up forever,\nbut I'm gonna try...
W1G2_204	Whew! Who knew frolicking could\nbe so exhausting?
W1G2_122	This is almost as good as flying.\nAlmost...
W1G2_206	Hup! Hah! See? I'm flying for very\nshort periods of time!
W1G2_123	Wee! Now I'm free to frolic and\nskylark about! Won't you join me?
W1G2_203	OK, that's probably enough.\n...For you! I'll never get enough!
W1G2_102	Ah, Mario! I didn't know you\nwere one of the faithful.\x0e\0\x04\0Have you come here seeking\nshellvation, like us?
W1G2_2	\x0e\x02\0\0{s[150]}Situation!{s[100]}\x0f\x02\0
W1G2_3	Situation! Situation!\nWe got a situation here!
W1G2_4	Whoa, whoa, whoa, calm down!\nWhat kind of situation? Is it a\ngood situation or a bad one?
W1G2_105	Bad situation!
W1G2_6	\x0e\x02\0\0\x0e\x03\x01\x04\x9a\x99\x99>Meet the Earth Vellumental...\x0f\x03\x01\x0f\x02\0\n\x0e\x02\0\0{c[795c1d]}{s[150]}Vellumental Temple{s[100]}{c[404040]}\x0f\x02\0\n\x0e\x02\0\0{c[cf2c12]}Donate, {c[404040]}worship, and {c[cf2c12]}donate {c[404040]}again!{c[0677eb]}{s[100]}→→{s[100]}{c[404040]}\x0f\x02\0
W1G2_66	It's a real bad situation, Mario.\x0e\0\x04\0The door to the Earth Vellumental\nis sealed! No one can get inside\nto pay tribute!
W1G2_85	The door will open only when all\nfive holy Shell Stones are placed\nin the Shell Stone receptacles!\x0e\0\x04\0But four of them are gone, and\nthat heathen is trying to steal\nthe fifth right now!
W1G2_151	We'd go try to stop him, but,\ny'know... We're Koopa Troopas.\x0e\0\x04\0What are we gonna do?\nWalk into him slowly?
W1G2_86	Whoa! I haven't seen power like\nthat since I watched a documentary\nabout the Earth Vellumental itself!
W1G2_209	Are you going to watch it? I don't\nwant to spoil anything for you.\x0e\0\x04\0Ah, but you should really see the\nexhibit first...and the other four\nShell Stones are missing!
W1G2_210	Ooh, how frustrating that they\nran off with your precious stones!\nAnd I really want to see the\nexhibit for myself...\x0e\0\x04\0Let's head off and find those Shell\nStones, Mario! I'm sure these guys\nhave thoroughly searched this area.
W1G2_88	There are four Shell Stones missing.\nWe can't get in to see the Earth\nVellumental without them!
W1G2_90	Thanks for everything you've done\nso far! Just three more to go...
W1G2_92	Thanks for everything you've done\nso far! Just two more to go...
W1G2_94	Bet you thought I was gonna thank\nyou. Joke's on me... I am.\x0e\0\x04\0Just one Shell Stone left!
W1G2_98	Thank you so much! Enjoy the tour!
W1G2_99	Ooh, I wish I could see the tour\nfor the first time again...
W1G2_44	Cheers, Mario! That was a right\nproper swing of the old hammer,\ninnit?\x0e\0\x04\0Swing like that, a bloke would\nassume you're wearin' some\nof them fancy accessories.\x0e\0\x04\0'Course, I don't need to tell you\nabout pressin'  to open the\nmenu to equip accessories, do I?
W1G2_216	Maybe I oughta take my own\nadvice, equip some of them\nflashy accessories...
W1G2_47	I never woulda got crumpled if\nI had equipped a weapon.\x0e\0\x04\0Are you equippin' your weapons,\nMario? You gotta stay ready!
W1G2_229	Thanks for that, Mario! But if\nyou're looking for a fortune,\nyou've rescued the wrong Toad.\x0e\0\x04\0I run the Fun, Funky, and Functional\naccessories shop in Toad Town.\nCome see me for accessories!
W1G2_50	You see that, guys? We're saved!\x0e\0\x04\0Let's rally behind Mario whenever\nhe gets into a fight. Just press  \nand we'll be your 12th Toads!
W1G2_51	Hooray!
W1G2_52	Remember to press !
W1G2_49	Ugh...I'm so weak from being\ncrumpled up for so long...\x0e\0\x04\0I wish I could just press  to use a\nMushroom like you, Mario. And then\nI'd press  to order a burrito.\n...Is that not what  does?
W1G2_16	Whoa, look at that cute house\nthat's all wrapped up in my\nbrother's streamer.\x0e\0\x04\0Do you think anyone's inside?\nOoh, they must be in a real bind...
W1G2_18	Hey! If anyone's inside that super-\ncute house...we're here to help!\x0e\0\x04\0Just hold tight, and we'll come\nback after we unwrap the red\nstreamer, OK?
W1G2_19	That should do it! Consider the\npeople inside 100 percent reassured.
W1G2_126	Oi! You got somethin' you wanna\nyak about?\x0e\0\x04\0Ah, yeah, that place. There's some\nkinda weird Toad livin' in there. He\nsciences a whole buncha weird junk.\x0e\0\x04\0Good luck gettin' in to see the guy.\nPlace is blocked by some kinda red\nstreamer thingy. Ah, you can see\nfor yourself.
W1G2_127	I told ya! The dude who lives\nthere is a real weird Toad.\nBuilds crazy junk.\x0e\0\x04\0Good luck bustin' in there! I figure\nhe'd of busted out already if he\ncould.
W1G2_157	If you ask me, the guy livin' in that\nhouse has a few screws loose.\nTalkin' all this "the world is actually\nround" nonsense. Pfft!
W1G2_213	Did that really just happen?\nI can't even swim!
W1G2_23	I'm the last one. I hope you're\nnot too disappointed...\x0e\0\x04\0Oh! I just meant I was the last\nToad rolled up in that hole. There\nare TONS more of us to find!

W1G2_22	Huh?! You came all the way here\nfrom Toad Town? And now you're\nheaded back?
W1G2_24	Yeah, unless you know a shortcut.\nLike maybe that pipe up ahead on\nOverlook Mountain?\x0e\0\x04\0Ahh, I'm still feeling a bit doggy,\nso I'm gonna woof it back. Hope to\nsee you at the Battle Lab! Awoooo!
W1G2_26	...Oh, I forgot to mention, we have\na membership drive going on right\nnow. Free gift for new members!\x0e\0\x04\0...Woof.
W1G2_25	A free gift? Mario, it's FREE!\nWe should definitely remember to\ncheck out that dog-Toad's lab.
W1G2_190	...THANKS...MARIO... HRGGGGH!\nTHIS...REALLY...WORKS...THE CORE...

W1G2_194	Thanks, Mario! I was using my sand\nwedge when I started thinking about\nmy sandwich and hit a bad shot\ninto the sand's edge.
W1G2_214	My mouth got filled with sand,\nwhich made me less hungry for\nmy sandwich.
W1G2_220	Thank you, Mario! Wondering how\nI already had this written? Me too.\n\x0e\x02\x02\0-Toad\x0f\x02\x02

W1G2_41	Wow, so that's how you get things\ndown that are stuck in trees. I'm\nfinally gonna get that kite back!
W1G2_42	Are you hitting all of the trees\naround here or just mine?
W1G2_137	Ahhh! The sun! The sky! Fresh air!\nI'm freeeee!
W1G2_43	Do you have any idea how deficient\nI am in vitamin D right now? I'm\ngonna stand here until I get enough!
W1G2_195	Oh, that was YOU?! I wouldn't have\nmade it so hard if I had known.\x0e\0\x04\0Here, lemme make it up to you.
W1G2_196	I found that in the ground,\nby the way.\x0e\0\x04\0Do you think those guys walking\naround with metal detectors might\nbe onto something?!
W1G2_225	That doesn't look like it'll fit.
W1G2_227	How cool! Those Shell Stones\x0e\x01\x01\0 did\nthe trick.\x0e\0\x04\0Well, should we go meet this\nVellumental? I'm so excited—I've\nnever met one before!
W1G2_231	The Shell Stones...
W1G2_228	Go on ahead without me, Big M.\nI'm a little claustrophobic.
Event_Powerup_03	Hey Mario, can we see if you got\nstronger when your HP went up?\x0e\0\x04\0I bet you could beat one of those\nGoombas with a single hammer strike\nor jump—without going into battle!
W1G2_9	Have you seen the temple\ncurator? I wonder if he's still\ntrapped in there...
W1G2_10	Thanks again for rescuing me, Mario.\nI don't suppose you'd be able to\nrescue the rest of my crew?\x0e\0\x04\0I'm sure they're using this divine\nmiracle as an excuse to shirk...
W1G2_11	You saved the entire crew! Now we\ncan get to work maximizing profit\noff of this whole thing. It's a miracle!

W1G3_45	Wait, you want to BUY it?\x0e\0\x04\0But you had so many chances\nalready! And me and my pals\nhere kinda want to keep it.
W1G3_46	Yeah! We've already worked out\na schedule for sharing it. I'll keep\nit at my place on days ending in "y."

W1G3_86	{s[075]}Still can't believe I sold that\nhunk of junk for 300 coins...\nI found it on the side of the road!{s[100]}
W1G3_87	Hope you like your new rock!
W1G3_92	I gotta restock before someone else\nfleeces these rubes...
W1G3_59	Thanks, Mario. Any more jumping\nand I might have grown actual legs.
W1G3_191	Wow! I was a grasshopper for\ndays, and I didn't learn a thing.\nGrasshopping is the worst!
W1G3_192	Will I ever hop again?\nProbably!
W1G3_193	I was on the grasshopper team\nin high school, so this really\nworked out for me.
W1G3_194	I'm saved! And now I'm gonna save\nYOU, Mario...\x0e\0\x04\0Try pressing  sometime when\nyou're in a pickle. It'll open up\na whole new world of info.\x0e\0\x04\0Seriously! I'm talking controls,\nsettings, basic info... It's all right\nthere for you.
W1G3_252	Oh my gosh! Mario, this is so\ninteresting but also kinda\nspooky...\x0e\0\x04\0It's the skeleton of a Koopa Troopa!\nIt must have been trapped in\nhere—poor thing.
W1G3_184	Rest your weary bones, poor Koopa.\nYou're in a better place now.
W1G3_185	*rattle, rattle*\n(Hey! I'm fine, and I'm not a Koopa\nTroopa. I'm a Dry Bones and I'm just\ndehydrated, OK?)
W1G3_188	Aww, it looked so happy!\nWe'll never forget you.
W1G3_61	Dang ol' fish got my lucky rock!

W1G3_234	Dang ol' fish got my lucky rock!\x0e\0\x04\0You wanna help me out?\nI can learn you how to fish.
W1G3_235	Need more fishin' lessons?\x0e\x01\x04\x14\n\0y\0e\0s\0n\0o\0\x01\0\0\0\x01\0\0\0
W1G3_62	Lessee here... First, get a good ol'\ngrip on them  and  Buttons.\nThen use  to aim for the fishies.\x0e\0\x04\0Go on and flick both  to cast\nwhen you're ready. The harder\nyou flick, the farther it goes.\x0e\0\x04\0Now when a fish starts gettin'\ninterested, it'll get to nibblin'.\nThat's when you gotta be patient!\x0e\0\x04\0Them fishies like to tease a li'l bit.\nWait until you got 'em good and\nhooked to yank back on !
W1G3_62_KeyOnly	Lessee here... First, use  to aim\nfor the fishies.\x0e\0\x04\0Go on and hold down  to cast\nwhen you're ready.\x0e\0\x04\0Now when a fish starts gettin'\ninterested, it'll get to nibblin'.\nThat's when you gotta be patient!\x0e\0\x04\0Them fishies like to tease a li'l bit.\nWait until you got 'em good and\nhooked before you go pressin' !
W1G3_268	Don't let that one get away, now.\nWhack him!
W1G3_106	\x0e\x02\0\0Done fishin'?\x0f\x02\0\x0e\x01\x04\x14\n\0y\0e\0s\0n\0o\0\x01\0\0\0\0\0\0\0
W1G3_63	Thanks for gettin' my lucky rock\nback. I guess I probably knew all\nalong it weren't really mine...\x0e\0\x04\0Can you take it on back to the\ntemple? And, uh, maybe don't tell\n'em where you found it...
W1G3_68	Y'know, this ain't the only fishin'\nhole around. You might could use\nthese skills elsewhere.\x0e\0\x04\0There's this one fish in particular\nthat's been gettin' my goat for\nyears. Goes by "Monster."\x0e\0\x04\0Yeah, most fish don't got names,\nbut this one does. Probably got a\nwhole house built outta broken\npoles and dreams down there...\x0e\0\x04\0You catch that one, you come on\nback and give ME a lesson. Haw!
W1G3_157	Thank you. Swimming was nice, but\nI was starting to get all wrinkly.
W1G3_81	Look, there's a Toad playing around\nwith the streamer up by that tram!
W1G3_226	Hey, uh...Toad? Can you stop\nplaying with the streamer now? It's\ndangerous! Just pop on out, OK?
W1G3_160	Pop out. Just pop out, Toad.\nOH, SURE! DON'T MIND IF I DO!\x0e\0\x04\0I'm trapped in this thing, lady!\nYou think I want to be gumming\nup the works like this?!\x0e\0\x04\0No one can get to Autumn Mountain\nbecause of me. And boy, do they\nenjoy reminding me of that!
W1G3_64	Oh! So this could take us to\nAutumn Mountain? If you weren't\nall tangled in it, I mean.\x0e\0\x04\0That's good to know! It must\nbe the reddish mountain over\nthere, right?
W1G3_69	Ahh, the blue streamer fluttering\nwith that red mountain in the\nbackground is so cool looking...\x0e\0\x04\0Huh?!
W1G3_187	There's the blue streamer, Mario!\nIt was so pretty I almost didn't\nrecognize it for what it was.\x0e\0\x04\0After we take care of the red\nstreamer, maybe we should come\nback here and follow the blue one.
W1G3_190	Just hang tight, Toad!\nUhhh...you know what I mean.\nStay loose? Ooh, that's worse...\nWe'll be back! Probably!

W1G3_119	Finally, the peak! What a climb...\x0e\0\x04\0\x0e\x01\x01\0...it must have been for you.\nGood job, Mario!
W1G3_120	All riiiight! Now we can just head\ninside, find the streamer, and...
W1G3_223	Uhhh...\nTell me, Mario. Is this what doors\nnormally look like? It isn't, right?\nHow do we get in?!
W1G3_66	Who on earth put the door up that\nhigh? I can't even float up there—\nhow are YOU going to get in?
W1G3_127	Wait...earth! That's it!\x0e\0\x04\0Something happened to the earth\nhere to make it like this. It's not\nsupposed to be so high up!
W1G3_121	Oh! It's a Magic Circle!
W1G3_117	But it's...different somehow.\nMaybe it has to do with the\nEarth Vellumental...
W1G3_140	But would the Earth Vellumental \nreally do a mean thing like this?\x0e\0\x04\0Maybe my brother used that Magic\nCircle to summon it here and MADE\nit do this.\x0e\0\x04\0I suppose we'll just have to track\nit down and see if it can help us.
W1G3_118	Should we try to find the Earth\nVellumental first?

W1G3_91	I always wanted to be a pro\nathlete. Not pro equipment!
W1G3_67	I can tell you, I sure wasn't having\na ball.
W1G3_88	This pipe leads to the Earth\nVellumental Temple over on\nPicnic Road.\x0e\0\x04\0Before those goons wadded me\nup into a soccer ball, it was my\njob to stare at it angrily.
W1G3_316	Nice running, Mario. You must\nbe exhausted! Here, take this.
W1G3_317	No ball? No problem!
W1G3_318	Visualization is how you REALLY\nget good at a game like this.
W1G3_319	You've heard of air guitar?\nThis is air soccer.
W1G3_129	Mario, you just found the first of the\nEarth Vellumental's Shell Stones!
W1G3_130	That's the second one we've found!
W1G3_131	That's the third one we've found!
W1G3_132	That's the last Shell Stone, Mario!
W1G3_133	Hmm, what do you suppose\nthis thing is?
W1G3_134	Well...we got another one of those\nweird stones. It must have some use!
W1G3_135	You sure are good at collecting\nthese mystery stones, Mario.
W1G3_136	That makes four very strange stones\nin our collection now. What are we\ngoing to do with these?!
W1G3_80	All right! Shake it like a piece\nof outdated photographic paper!
W1G3_73	Well! Not bad, if I say so myself!
W1G3_75	You guys did it! I'm free!\x0e\0\x04\0You wanna go to Autumn Mountain\nnow? I know it hasn't been that\nlong, but I can't wait to operate\nthe tram again. It's tramtastic!
W1G3_76	That's where we're headed, right\nMario? Because it looks like that's\nwhere the blue streamer leads.
W1G3_78	I've got one passenger waiting,\nso just let me know one way or\nthe other.
W1G3_77	Are you catching this ride?\x0e\x01\x04\x14\n\0y\0e\0s\0n\0o\0\x01\0\0\0\0\0\0\0
W1G3_89	Need to prep first? That's fine...\nbut one other passenger is already\nseated. Don't keep him waiting!
W1G3_204	Hey! What's the holdup? Everything\nOK out there?
W1G3_205	Everything's fine, sir. Just getting\nthese final passengers ready. Off\nyou go to Autumn Mountain! Enjoy!
W1G3_197	Wow! This is amazing!\x0e\0\x04\0We're up so high!\nThe view is so vast!\nThese mountains are so huge!
W1G3_314	Are you SEEING this, Mario?\x0e\0\x04\0Mountains here, mountains there...\nIt's mountains all the way up!\x0e\0\x04\0Why didn't anyone tell me that the\nworld could be so wonderful?!
W1G3_199	Is this your first time out of\nthe house or something?
W1G3_200	Oh! Were you asleep? I'm so sorry.\nI didn't mean to wake you. I'm just\nvery excited!
W1G3_216	My friend Mario and I are on a quest\nto follow a big, blue streamer!\x0e\0\x04\0What's your story? What brings you\naboard this tram today?
W1G3_201	Me? Well...I'm Bob-omb.\x0e\0\x04\0Aaand...that's about all I remember.\x0e\0\x04\0You know that memory-loss thing?\nWhat's it called... Ambrosia?\nAmnesty? Thinky Thinky Panic?\x0e\0\x04\0Whatever you call it, I've got it—\nbig time. So I'm on a solo journey to\ntry and remember...well, anything!\x0e\0\x04\0My home, my purpose... All that.
W1G3_202	You have AMNESIA? You don't have\nANY memories? Oh, you poor thing!
W1G3_212	I have a GREAT idea!\x0e\0\x04\0You should join us on our quest!\x0e\0\x04\0We can help you recover your lost\nmemories...and make a ton of new\nones along the way!
W1G3_213	What do you say, Mario? Wouldn't\nit be great if this guy joined us?
W1G3_203	Wow. Really?\x0e\0\x04\0Gee, I couldn't put you two out like\nthat. I mean, it's a kind offer, but...\x0e\0\x04\0I don't even have any special moves.\nI'd just be in the way.\x0e\0\x04\0I mean, I could probably be talked\ninto it, if you really wanted, but—
W1G3_215	OK! Never mind.\x0e\0\x04\0You raised some great points.\nIt's probably better for you to\ntravel alone.\x0e\0\x04\0Sorry to bother you.\nHave a good journey!
W1G3_208	Wow!
W1G3_209	So beautiful!
W1G3_210	Ooooh!
W1G3_214	H-hey.\x0e\0\x04\0Is...is that offer still on the table?\nY'know, to, uh...to join you two?\x0e\0\x04\0Because I might...be considering it.\nJoining you, that is. On your quest.
W1G3_232	You, with the cool 'stache and the\nbig M... Your name was Mario, right?\x0e\0\x04\0That sounds so familiar. I feel like\nyou're some kind of pro at this\nadventure stuff.\x0e\0\x04\0So uh...can I? Join you, that is?\n{s[075]}Please?{s[100]}\x0e\x01\x04\x14\n\0y\0e\0s\0n\0o\0\x01\0\0\0\0\0\0\0
W1G3_260	Ahhh. I see.\x0e\0\x04\0Right, because...I said all that stuff\nabout being in the way. Yeah, I'd\njust be a burden.\x0e\0\x04\0I get it. No hard feelings. I'm gonna\nnap a bit before we get to Autumn\nMountain.
W1G3_307	OK, so listen.\x0e\0\x04\0I thought about it a bit more, and\nthat floating lady already invited\nme to join, right?\x0e\0\x04\0Taking that offer back now would\nbe really mean. And you don't look\nlike a mean guy!\x0e\0\x04\0So here it is, cards on the table...\nI would LOVE to join you both on\nyour quest. What do you say, Big M?\x0e\x01\x04\x14\n\0y\0e\0s\0n\0o\0\x01\0\0\0\0\0\0\0
W1G3_308	Ha haaa. Ahhh. OK.\x0e\0\x04\0You must...have your reasons.\nI'll just sit this one out. Some\nother time, maybe.
W1G3_309	Did I mention that I've lost ALL my\nmemories?\x0e\0\x04\0Sorry, I just wanted to make sure\nyou caught that part. You've been\nvery quiet.\x0e\0\x04\0Which is cool, d-don't get me wrong!\nLove the strong, silent hero type.\nI could learn a lot from you.\x0e\0\x04\0Master and pupil! Hero and sidekick!\nFate must have brought us together.\nYou can't deny fate...right?\x0e\x01\x04\x14\n\0y\0e\0s\0n\0o\0\x01\0\0\0\0\0\0\0
W1G3_310	Sorry, was that "No, I can't deny\nfate," or "No, you can't join us"?\nI should have...phrased it better...
W1G3_311	Please! PLEASE let me join you on\nyour adventure! I'm begging you!\x0e\x01\x04\x14\n\0y\0e\0s\0n\0o\0\x01\0\0\0\0\0\0\0
W1G3_312	Mario! Come on! We'll never get to\nAutumn Mountain at this rate!
W1G3_207	Ooh! Check it out! The top of that\nmountain is bright red! That has to\nbe Autumn Mountain...
W1G3_313	Hooraaaay!
W1G3_217	Wow, you're right! That mountain\npractically screams autumn!\nThat has to be it!
W1G3_218	That means we'll be stopping soon.\nI can't wait to stretch my legs,\nassuming I have them...somewhere...\x0e\0\x04\0Now that we're traveling buddies,\nlet me introduce myself for real.\nI'm Bob-omb!\x0e\0\x04\0I promise not to slow you down,\nBig M! And you too, ma'am!
W1G3_219	My name is Olivia! Nice to meet you!
W1G3_320	Whoa! You found me! Just before I\nresigned myself to an eternity of\nloneliness. Close one!
W1G3_321	My telepathic cries for help got\nthrough to you! I'm going to go into\nbusiness as a psychic right now!
W1G3_322	I had this whole lonely ledge to\nmyself for ages...\x0e\0\x04\0It was great! But I should probably\nget back home. Thanks!
W1G3_323	Forget about ME—I'm pretty sure\nthere was an earthquake! Are YOU\nall right, Mario?\x0e\0\x04\0Sorry, no time to wait for\nan answer.
W1G3_324	Another day or two in there and\nI was gonna bloom.
W1G3_325	Yes! Someone finally read the fine\nprint on the back of the sign!\x0e\0\x04\0Now I'm saved, and you're aware\nof the sign's limited liability and\nfull terms and conditions of use.

W2C1_13	Bold move, Mario! Jumping off a\nbridge to save poor Bobby...\x0e\0\x04\0If we survived that fall, I'm sure\nhe did too.\x0e\0\x04\0We're bound to bump into the little\nguy if we just follow the path up\nand out of here...right?
W2C1_16	Whoa! What the heck is THAT?\x0e\0\x04\0Something round is rolling this way...
W2C1_42	Oh! That has to be Bobby! I didn't\nthink we'd find him this fast!
W2C1_43	Bobbyyyyyy!
W2C1_26	Not Bobby!
W2C1_51	Help meee!
W2C1_25	We're the Chestnut Trio! Thanks\nfor conking our conker!
W2C1_41	Big M! Ma'am! You saved me!\x0e\0\x04\0I didn't mean to fall off that bridge!\nHonest! I said I wouldn't slow you\ntwo down... I'm so sorry...\x0e\0\x04\0*sniff* M-my two best buds just\nsaved my life! What a great\nmemory this is gonna be...
W2C1_47	Well! Um...we're just glad you're OK.\x0e\0\x04\0You have to be more careful, Bobby.\nDon't go tumbling over any more\nbridges, all right?
W2C1_52	*sniff* It's just Bob-omb, ma'am.\nAnd I won't! I promise. I'd even\npinky swear, if I had a pinky.\x0e\0\x04\0Can we hurry out of here now?\nThese pointy chestnut things\nlook like they HURT.
W2C1_19	Thank!
W2C1_20	You!
W2C1_21	SSSSO MUCH!

W2C1_45	Yikes!

W2C1_49	WHYYYY?
W2C1_50	*sigh* There he goes again.
W2C1_53	Bobby's not up here. He couldn't\nhave tumbled back this far...right?
W2C1_34	Hm?\x0e\0\x04\0Oh! Hey, Big M. I found a shortcut\nafter I tumbled downhill! Neat, huh?\x0e\0\x04\0Took you two a minute to catch up.\nGuess I dozed off...
W2C1_31	Sounds good to me! Water\nVellumental, here we come!
W2C1_32	Thank goodness!\x0e\0\x04\0I'm just glad we won't have to go\nsearching for you anymore...RIGHT?\x0e\0\x04\0Now, let's FINALLY go visit the\nWater Vellumental Shrine!
W2C1_29	\x0e\x01\x03\x04\x03\0\0\0Mmmmm, nyum nyum...\nMore chestnuts, please...
W2C1_30	Ah. We searched high and low,\nfearing the worst...but he's been\nsleeping right by the exit.\x0e\0\x04\0Let's show him how relieved we are\nby giving him an oh-so-gentle wake\n-up tap, Mario.
W2C1_33	Phew! Thanks a bunch, Mario!\nThese chestnuts sure are a pain...\x0e\0\x04\0If you've taken too many hits to\nyour own chestnut, just press \nand take a Mushroom break!
W2C1_35	I must flutter!
W2C2.msbt
W2C2_1	Check out that stone dragon in the\nback! Is that the Water Vellumental?\nOoh, Bobby's really missing out...
W2C2_21	Whaaaat in the world is this thing?\x0e\0\x04\0You probably have to put a thing\nin a thing...and do some other thing\nto something else...\x0e\0\x04\0But I have no idea where to start.
W2C2_31	OK...I have absolutely no idea what\nwe're supposed to do here.\x0e\0\x04\0Let's look around. Maybe there's\nsomething in here that can help\nus crack this puzzle!
W2C2_2	Ohhh, don't give up now! We're\nso close, Mario!
W2C2_3	We did it! Look at all that water.\nWhere do you think it goes?
W2C2_33	What do you think this thing is?\x0e\0\x04\0Haven't we seen something\nsquarish like this nearby?\nKind of panel-y?\x0e\0\x04\0Hmm... Where was it?
W2C2_36	Oh! Of course! That tile we picked\nup is a perfect fit for this thing!\x0e\x01\x04\x18\x0e\0K\0e\0y\0I\0t\0e\0m\0\xff\xff\xff\xff\0\0\0\0
W2C2_41	That tile we picked up is a perfect\nfit for this thing!\x0e\x01\x04\x18\x0e\0K\0e\0y\0I\0t\0e\0m\0\xff\xff\xff\xff\0\0\0\0
W2C2_42	Hm. Not quite. Let's try again...
W2C2_47	See? Juuust the right size. Let's\nsee if we can slip this tile in as\nthe last step...
W2C2_6	Ooh! The Water Vellumental's mouth\nis half-open now!\x0e\0\x04\0It looks kinda shocked. Must be\namazed that we solved that super-\nhard tile puzzle! Heehee.
W2C2_7	Wow! Check out those fangs!\x0e\0\x04\0I can't wait to see how cool this\nstatue looks when its mouth is\nwiiiide open.
W2C2_23	Another Water Vellumental statue!\nWith...a LOT of water coming out\nof its mouth.\x0e\0\x04\0I'm not sure if it's making me thirsty\nor the opposite of thirsty...but it\nsure makes me feel something.\x0e\0\x04\0Anyway, I guess being the Water\nVellumental means you just REALLY\nlike water. You'd have to, right?
W2C2_50	Do you think we're supposed to\nslide these tiles around?
W2C2_51	That tile will slide right into the\nblank spot! Just get the other\ntiles in place first...
W2C2_52	Hm. Those grooves in each tile have\nto be there for a reason...
W2C2_37	Looks like we're on another tile\nhunt. Where is this one hiding?
W2C2_45	Hey, look! There's something written\nunder the platform.\x0e\0\x04\0And what's that opening next to it?\nIs that...a coin slot?
W2C2_46	I guess we could try that coin slot...
W2C2_38	{s[100]}\x0e\x02\0\0{c[0677eb]}DRIZZLY HINT　　　500{c[404040]}\x0f\x02\0\n\x0e\x02\0\0{c[0677eb]}SPLASHY HINT　　 1,000{c[404040]}\x0f\x02\0{s[100]}\n\x0e\x02\0\0{c[0677eb]}{s[100]}KASPLOOSHY HINT　3,000{s[100]}{c[404040]}\x0f\x02\0\x0e\x01\x04\x18\x0e\0W\02\0C\02\0_\03\09\0\x03\0\0\0\x03\0\0\0
W2C2_39	Insert 500 coins\nInsert 1,000 coins\nInsert 3,000 coins\nInsert nothing
W2C2_49	Aww, we don't have enough coins.
W2C2_34	Nothing's happening... I guess we\nhave to work at it some more.
W2C2_40	Nothing's happening? Aww! I really\nthought we had it when the grooves\nwere lined up...\x0e\0\x04\0Maybe we need to line up ALL of the\ngrooves? Oof. That sounds hard...
W2C2_43	Oh! Looks like we can slide a tile\ninto this opening too!\x0e\x01\x04\x18\x0e\0K\0e\0y\0I\0t\0e\0m\0\xff\xff\xff\xff\0\0\0\0
W2C2_44	Looks like you can put a tile right\nhere too!\x0e\x01\x04\x18\x0e\0K\0e\0y\0I\0t\0e\0m\0\xff\xff\xff\xff\0\0\0\0
W2C2_48	I don't think that's it...
W2C2_12	Yes! The Water Vellumental's mouth\nis wiiide open now!\x0e\0\x04\0Almost looks like it's roaring.\nRAAWRRR! Heh heh.\x0e\0\x04\0Oh, hey! Look inside its mouth...\nAre those stairs? That must be the\nway to the Water Vellumental.\x0e\0\x04\0I hope we can make it up those \nsteps without the statue chomping\ndown on us... *gulp*
W2C2_14	Aaaah! It's the Water Vellumental!\x0e\0\x04\0Someone folded it up! It doesn't look\nlike the stone face in the main room\nat all...\x0e\0\x04\0Come on, Mario. Let's try to bop\nit back to its former glory!
W2C2_26	*gasp*\nLook, Mario! it turned into another\nBibliofold, just like the last one!
W2C2_17	Let's see... Hmm...\x0e\0\x04\0Oooh, I get it now. You start by\nfolding it here, like this.\x0e\0\x04\0Then you fold this part along here.\nNext you do thiiis, then thaaat...
W2C2_27	I think I've got it! I've mastered the\nfolds of the Water Vellumental!\x0e\0\x04\0Let's give this new power a try,\nshall we?
W2C2_29	How do I look? Am I dignified and\ncool like the Water Vellumental?\x0e\0\x04\0Oof. I actually feel...EXTREMELY\nwell hydrated. I...I'm...
W2C2_30	I'm overflowing! S-stand back!
W2C2_18	Did you SEE that? Did you see ME?\nI hope that looked as cool as it felt!\x0e\0\x04\0Now we can fill that dried lake\nback up for sure! Ha ha!
W2C2_19	Oh my gosh! Mario! Thank goodness\nyou noticed me!\x0e\0\x04\0I thought I was doomed to live my\nlife as window dressing in this damp,\nforgotten shrine!
W2C2_25	Wow! My joy in being rescued turned\ninto an actual heart! I didn't know\nI could do that.\x0e\0\x04\0Maybe I can make a sandwich\nappear next if I think about how\nhungry I am...
W2C2_20	The most embarrassing part of being\nwindow dressing was knowing that\nmy colors clashed with the decor.
W2C2_53	You used your precious confetti\nsupply to save little ol' me? Shucks!\x0e\0\x04\0By the way...thrown confetti that\nlands outside of a Not-Bottomless\nHole won't vanish, so don't worry\nabout wasting it!
W2C3.msbt
W2C3_31	Is it just my imagination...or are we\nspeeding up?\x0e\x01\0\x04\x88\x13\0\0
W2C3_32	Yep! We're almost at the rapids.\nYou folks ready fer a white-knuckle\nride down ol' Eddy River?\x0e\x01\0\x04p\x17\0\0
W2C3_33	White-knuckle?! We thought this\nwas gonna be a peaceful river tour!\x0e\x01\0\x04\x94\x11\0\0
W2C3_34	Oh, don't pretend ya ain't excited!\nWe can't turn back anyhow, so relax\nand enjoy the ride.\x0e\x01\0\x04\x88\x13\0\0\x0e\0\x04\0Hm. The river IS flowin' a bit fast...\nIt's as if somebody flooded this river\nto the brim, then kept on floodin'!\x0e\x01\0\x04p\x17\0\0
W2C3_40	What? Oh no! Th-this isn't my—\nNobody told me— Aaarrgh!\x0e\x01\0\x04\xac\x0d\0\0
W2C3_1	Mario, I'm gonna need yer help\nthrough this next bit. Tell me which\nway to steer the boat with {s[100]}↕{s[100]}.\x0e\x01\0\x04\x88\x13\0\0\x0e\0\x04\0Try not to hit any walls or rocks.\nIf my boat gets too banged up,\nwe might be in trouble.\x0e\x01\0\x04\x88\x13\0\0\x0e\0\x04\0Oh, and ya won't be able to open\nyer menu for a stretch. Best to\nfocus on the rapids, y'know?\x0e\x01\0\x04\x88\x13\0\0\x0e\0\x04\0OK! Grab hold of somethin', folks!\nHere come the Eddy River rapids!\x0e\x01\0\x04\x94\x11\0\0

W2C3_22	Aah! Falling rocks!

W2C3_12	Okeydoke! We're in the clear. How'd\nyou folks like the Eddy River rapids?\nDid ya have fun?\x0e\x01\0\x04p\x17\0\0
W2C3_13	Wow, we breezed right through that.\nMy knuckles aren't white at all! Is it\nweird that I'm disappointed?\x0e\x01\0\x04\x88\x13\0\0
W2C3_26	Phew... Some of those close calls\nwere a bit too close for my comfort.\nMy pulse was pounding!\x0e\x01\0\x04\x88\x13\0\0
W2C3_28	You weren't kidding! My knuckles\nare stark white after all those tight\nsqueezes. That was SUPER fun!\x0e\x01\0\x04|\x15\0\0
W2C3_14	And our boat didn't get so much as\na scuff mark. That's amazing!\x0e\x01\0\x04\x88\x13\0\0
W2C3_45	Guessin' ya felt a little coin-shy\nback there, eh? There's a cool prize\nif ya nab all of 'em, so try again!\x0e\x01\0\x04\x94\x11\0\0
W2C3_46	Looks like ya missed a few coins\nalong the way. There's a cool prize\nif ya nab all of 'em, so try again!\x0e\x01\0\x04\x88\x13\0\0

W2C4_89	Ohhh, don't be such a wet blanket.\nThis could be another fun memory!
W2C4_90	Wait! We're not going in there?\nYou don't want to check this out?!\x0e\0\x04\0But...n-ninja tricks...

W2C4_14	Woo-hoo! We did it!\x0e\0\x04\0And I'm the one who solved the\ntrickiest tricks, so that makes\nme the TRUEST ninja of all!
W2C4_18	But...I guess you're the one who\nactually made their way through\nthose traps, Mario. So...
W2C4_19	We're both official ninjas!
W2C4_25	Woo-hoo! You did it! You made it\nthrough in one piece!
W2C4_26	You're amazing, Mario! You figured\nout every trick without any help!\x0e\0\x04\0I'll be honest...there were some\nrooms I definitely wouldn't have\nfigured out on my own.\x0e\0\x04\0Great job, you ninja master!
W2C4_43	Woo-hoo! We did it again!\nIn your FACE, ninja house!
W2C4_72	You found \x0e\x03\0\x04\0\0\0\0 hidden ninjas...but many\nmore still lurk within these walls.\nYou must take this trial seriously!\x0e\0\x04\0Your ninja rank is...Apprentice Ninja!\nAnd apprentices don't get rewards!\nNow, BEGONE!\x0e\0\x04\0...Thanks for visiting. Try again soon!

W2C4_64	This house of tricks is...well, it's\ntricky! We'll get 'em all next time!
W2C4_66	Did you hear that? A perfect score!\nWhen it comes to ninja skills, you're\nthe ninjiest one here!
W2C4_96	That was so much fun! Let's do it\nagain, Mario!
W2C4_58	Yay! That house is never not fun!
W2C4_91	We're still locked out of the castle\ngate, and you're trying to talk Big M\ninto having more fun?
W2C4_97	Hey! I'm taking this mission VERY\nseriously. Especially the fun parts!
W2C4_92	I'm glad you're enjoying this, ma'am.\x0e\0\x04\0But...isn't it about time to stop\nplaying around and look for that\nmaster key?
W2C4_98	You really think I'm here JUST to\nplay around? Please.\x0e\0\x04\0I'm checking to see if the key is\nhiding INSIDE that ninja house\nWHILE I play around. You see?
W2C4_93	OK, well, did you spot the green\nguy in there at all?\x0e\0\x04\0That is why we came here, right?\nTo find the suspicious green guy\nthat ran inside?
W2C4_36	Uh...of course! I didn't forget that!\x0e\0\x04\0The green guy wasn't in there...\nwas he? I don't think he was.\x0e\0\x04\0He may have been in there, or he\nmay NOT have been! Hard to say.\x0e\0\x04\0I guess we'll just have to play again.\nCHECK again! I meant check!
W2C4_42	Wait! Luigi is still caught in those\nbig gears! Shouldn't we, y'know...\nsave him?
W2C4_46	Hey! You JUST missed it. That guy\nin green we were looking for came\nsprinting out of there.\x0e\0\x04\0Think he's a newly minted ninja?\nHard to imagine he'll last long in\na bright-green getup like that.
W2C4_44	It's a good thing Luigi got caught\nin those gears. Now we have the\nmaster key to this whole park!
W2C4_99	Uh...did either of you hear me? Am I\ninvisible or something? I didn't even\ndo any ninja training!\x0e\0\x04\0I guess we should open that castle\ngate now...he said to no one in\nparticular.
W2C4_7	Theeere he is. There's Luigi.\x0e\0\x04\0I was hoping he'd get himself in gear\nand find that key, but...not like this.\x0e\0\x04\0I guess we should probably save him\nfrom this giant machine...somehow.\nAny ideas?
W2C4_32	Waaah! C-can't...move!\x0e\0\x04\0Somebody! Anybody! Preferably\nMario, if possible! Save me!
W2C4_80	Save me!
W2C4_81	Can't move!
W2C4_83	Huh?
W2C4_84	I'm-a moving?
W2C4_85	I'm-a saved!
W2C4_86	Hooray!
W2C4_95	Uh...
W2C4_87	I'm-a NOT saved! Help!
W2C4_4	Wait! Is that you, Big Bro? \nI'd recognize that confident\nsilence anywhere! Help meee!
W2C4_3	You saved me! Thanks, Big Bro!
W2C4_8	Good timing too. I have a surprise!\x0e\0\x04\0It's-a the key to Peach's Castle!\nI finally found it!
W2C4_6	You wouldn't believe the day I've\nhad in this wacky theme park.\x0e\0\x04\0I was heading back to find you...\nwhen a terrifying Chain Chomp\ntried to bite my face off!\x0e\0\x04\0I ran into this-a house to hide, but\ncouldn't find the exit. Then, BAM!\nNinjas started flying at my face!\x0e\0\x04\0Eventually, I tumbled down here...\nNext thing I know, I'm-a gumming\nup the works. With-a my face.\x0e\0\x04\0Yep. It's-a been a rough day for me\nand my face...but it was all worth\nit to finally hand over that key!
W2C4_57	{s[075]}Ohhh gosh. How should we tell him?{s[100]}\x0e\0\x04\0Thanks for your hard work, Luigi!\nWe definitely needed this key, and\nwe really appreciate it, but...\x0e\0\x04\0This isn't the key to Peach's Castle.\nIt's the master key to this park!
W2C4_5	What?! I risked my face to find the\nwrong key? Now I'm-a losing face...\nand it's the only one I've got!\x0e\0\x04\0It was hanging on the wall in such\nan important spot... I thought for\nsure I had the right one.
W2C4_17	OK! I won't let this get me down!\nI'm-a gonna find the REAL key to\nPeach's Castle!\x0e\0\x04\0See you later, Big Bro!\nYou too, Olivia!
W2C4_56	Wow, he took that well. Your brother\nis fun! I'm sorta jealous.\x0e\0\x04\0I'd stop him, but...we WILL need the\nkey to Peach's Castle after we take\ncare of all the streamers.\x0e\0\x04\0I guess we should let Luigi continue\nhis search, right? He'll probably\nbe...fine...
W2C4_94	And now that we have the master\nkey, we can open any door in this\nwhole park!\x0e\0\x04\0Let's go open that castle gate...\nriiiight after we finish this fun\nninja house!
W2C4_22	Ah, Mario! I can't believe you found\nme...lost under a rock, of all places!\x0e\0\x04\0Everybody around here seems lost.\nLike, I saw some tall, skinny guy who\nlooked SUPER lost just go inside!
W2C4_23	Huh. You're the second guy with a\nmustache and overalls to visit this\nattraction today. Weird!
W2C4_35	Woo! Thanks!\x0e\0\x04\0\x0e\x01\x01\0Huh. The shuriken on this sign are\nsupposed to move... Hope the folks\nin the maintenance room are OK.

W2C5_14	I was supposed to emcee this show,\nbut after a couple of rehearsals...\nthey recast me as a cactus.
W2C5_49	They told me I had "tremendous\ncactus energy." I don't know what\nthat means!
W2C5_15	We know seats
W2C5_17	are scarce, but
W2C5_18	this is a bit much
W2C5_19	to ask of us,
W2C5_20	don't you think?
W2C5_205	This act is over, Mario. You'd better\nreturn to your seat.
W2C5_5	Mario! Please! Return to your seat\nbefore IT gets mad!

W2C5_309	Ooh, what a TREAT! And it's not\neven my birthday!\x0e\0\x04\0I want to see a good, clean fight.\nTry not to bruise each other TOO\nbadly, OK?
W2C5_310	"You're pretty tough after all...\nbut playtime's over."
W2C5_311	"Yeah! It's time to bust out the\nADVANCED choreography!"
W2C5_312	Yes!♡
W2C5_313	I knew you'd mop the floor with\nthose delinquents, but my GOSH.\x0e\0\x04\0Now I've got Mario madness...\nand you've got the only cure.♡

W2C5_209	Aw, phooey. Forget the romance.\nThat fight scene was INTENSE!\nMakes me wish I had fists to clench!
W2C5_25	UGH! That's NOT how that act was\nsupposed to end!\x0e\0\x04\0I mean, really! There's no way Mario\nis actually THAT strong! Talk about\na STRETCH!\x0e\0\x04\0You Paper Macho goons had better\nband together in the NEXT act...\nor I may SNAP!

W2C5_210	Mario! You can fight, act, AND\ndance? Is there anything you\nCAN'T do?!
W2C5_211	That first half was boring...but the\nsecond half was awesome! Ballet\nis way better with hammers.
W2C5_55	Ooooh, I have HAD IT with your\nshow stealing and grandstanding!\x0e\0\x04\0You wish to be the STAR? Fine!\nCome on up and face the MUSIC!

W2G1_238	This looks like the perfect place to\nmake new memories! Right, Bombert?
W2G1_239	Uh, the name is Bob-omb...ma'am.\nAnyway, we should probably start\nfollowing that blue streamer.
W2G1_42	Welcome to Autumn Mountain!\nUp and autumn!\x0e\0\x04\0Oh, Mario! Thanks for the save.\nCome see me if you want to ride\nthe tram, OK?
W2G1_325	\x0e\x03\x02\0Flop, flop.\x0f\x03\x02
W2G1_331	\x0e\x03\x02\0Somebody floppin' help me!\x0f\x03\x02
W2G1_343	Whoa. How did a fish get all the\nway up this mountain?
W2G1_245	That fish looks super confused.\nMaybe even more than me!
W2G1_39	Phew! Flops for flopping me out!
W2G1_43	FLOP?! I mean, HUH?! It's Mario!\nThanks a flop—err, a lot!\x0e\0\x04\0I've been stuck up on this mountain\nfor days, longing for the open sea...\x0e\0\x04\0See, I'm actually...Sea Captain Toad!
W2G1_52	I'll be tending to my ship by the port\nin Toad Town. Stop by and give me\nan "ahoy" on your next visit!
W2G1_64	Ooh! A sea captain! I just love the\nidea of cruising around the open\nocean. It sounds so elegant!\x0e\0\x04\0Next time we're passing through\nToad Town, we should definitely\nstop by the port to see his boat.
W2G1_68	OK! Now that sea captain can take\nus out to sea! Let's rush back to the\nport in town, Big M.
W2G1_164	Hey! This must be the streamer you\ntwo were talking about.\x0e\0\x04\0Looks like the source is off to the\nleft somewhere. I'll scout up ahead!
W2G1_165	Careful, Bhomas! Don't fall!
W2G1_240	PLEASE don't call me Bhomas!\nMy name is Bob-omb!
W2G1_241	Don't worry. I definitely heard him\nthis time. I'll be sure to get Bobby's\nname right from now on!
W2G1_190	Are you sure it's OK to let Bobby\nwander off on his own like that?
W2G1_166	Hey, Big M! Check this out!
W2G1_134	What the— A dead end?!\x0e\0\x04\0How are we supposed to follow the\nstreamer now? Curse you, you lousy\ndead end!
W2G1_139	These boulders are way too big to\njump over...even for a guy like you,\nBig M.
W2G1_145	If we can't go that way, I guess we\ncould see what's up the mountain?
W2G1_37	Oh? Who's this? Another potential\ntraveling buddy?\x0e\0\x04\0Heyyyy! Pointy! Wanna make\nsome fun memories with us?
W2G1_74	\x0e\x02\0\0{s[120]}Bobby! Stop!{s[100]}\x0f\x02\0
W2G1_91	Be careful! Those Folded Soldiers\nare dangerous!
W2G1_127	This little guy? Really? I guess those\nspikes do make him look tough...\x0e\0\x04\0All right. I'll try to steer clear of\nthese foldy guys.
W2G1_7	Oh! Hi there, little fishies!\x0e\0\x04\0These mountain fish must spend\ntheir whole lives flopping around\non the surface. How interesting!
W2G1_8	Uh...I know I lost my memory, but\nthat doesn't sound right. Don't\nmost fish kinda NEED water?
W2G1_287	Are ALL of these cans empty?\nIt's like a garbage dump down here!
W2G1_288	This is a LOT of canned food.\nMust be an entire year's worth...
W2G1_334	Let's see. The labels say...A-N-U-T.\nWhat is "an ut"?\x0e\0\x04\0Oh, wait. Which region are we in?\nI was reading it backwards. I guess\nit's just..."tuna."
W2G1_335	Are ALL of these tuna cans empty?\nIt's like a garbage dump down here!
W2G1_336	This is a LOT of canned tuna.\nMust be an entire year's worth...
W2G1_337	That's...a LOT of cans of tuna.
W2G1_268	Whoa! A boat? All the way up here?
W2G1_226	Oh, Bobby. You poor thing.\x0e\0\x04\0I may not be well-traveled, but I do\nknow that boats...float. This thing is\njust sitting here. It can't be a boat.\x0e\0\x04\0The amnesia must've sapped your\nmemories AND your brainpower.\nHow cruel...
W2G1_270	...I know what a boat is, ma'am.\x0e\0\x04\0And if there's a boat here...then\nthis is supposed to be a lake.\x0e\0\x04\0And if that's the case, this lake\nmust be...
W2G1_271	\x0e\x02\0\0{s[120]}ALL DRIED UP!{s[100]}\x0f\x02\0
W2G1_232	Wow! That's astounding!\nSo this is a lake...\x0e\0\x04\0Wait! Isn't that dangerous?! W-we\ncould get soaked! We have to get\nout of here before we get pulped!
W2G1_231	This lake looks dry, so we're\nprobably fine.\x0e\0\x04\0But...if there WAS water...we could\nride in this boat!\x0e\0\x04\0And if we could do THAT, we could\nfloat right over to that dead end\nand follow the blue streamer!
W2G1_332	So we just have to fill this lake\nback up?\x0e\0\x04\0I...don't have a clue how to help\nwith this one. Where should we\neven start?
W2G1_276	If we could ride in this boat, then\nwe could follow the blue streamer...
W2G1_306	Aww! What a funny little guy.\nHey, monkey! What are you doing\nup there?
W2G1_307	Huh. Must be shy.
W2G1_45	I came here to see if I could get a\njob with the river tours, but I ended\nup getting canned—literally!\x0e\0\x04\0This tour guide must REALLY love\ntuna. I'll bet paddling with one oar\nworks up an appetite.
W2G1_266	This tour guide must REALLY love\ntuna. I'll bet paddling with one oar\nworks up an appetite.
W2G1_209	Oh, cool!
W2G1_154	Guys! Over here! I think I'm about\nto make a new memory!
W2G1_155	Look at that! Incredible view, right?\x0e\0\x04\0And check out that building over\nthere! Getting total shrine vibes.\x0e\0\x04\0If I were a big shot water spirit,\nI'd want to live in a place just\nlike that.
W2G1_19	Hmm! I agree, Bobby. It does look\nvery watery. And shrine-like!\x0e\0\x04\0Hold on...a water shrine...for some\nkind of water spirit...
W2G1_66	AAH! Could that be the Water\nVellumental's shrine?
W2G1_67	Mario! We found it! That HAS to be\nthe home of the Water Vellumental,\nlord of all liquids!
W2G1_205	Hmm! So this Water Vellumental is\nsome kind of water boss, huh?\x0e\0\x04\0Why don't we ask it if it can fill\nthe lake back in?
W2G1_13	Oooh!
W2G1_14	Look at this Magic Circle! It's got a\nreal "Water Vellumental" look to it,\ndon't you think?
W2G1_291	With a Magic Circle like this, I'm sure\nwe could do something about the\ndry lake!\x0e\0\x04\0Let's head to that shrine, Mario.\nWater Vellumental, here we come!
W2G1_16	Let's head to that shrine, Mario.\nWater Vellumental, here we come!
W2G1_104	Woooow! So much tall grass...\nHow pretty!\x0e\0\x04\0We might not be able to see you\nin there, Bobby. Stay close and\ndon't get lost, OK?
W2G1_283	What a tiny house! How cute!
W2G1_79	Ahh. We made it through the\ntall grass.\x0e\0\x04\0It kept brushing against the outside\nof your pocket... So tickly! It was\nhard not to laugh.
W2G1_24	Look how close we are to the\nWater Vellumental's shrine!\x0e\0\x04\0We'll be there before we know it.
W2G1_295	Just a bit farther! Right, Bobby?
W2G1_294	Aaaaaaand he's gone.
W2G1_302	He, uh...he probably got excited and\nran ahead of us again. Heh.\x0e\0\x04\0It's cute that he wants to show off\nhow fast his little legs can move,\nassuming he has them...somewhere.
W2G1_301	So you're waiting for your best buds,\nhuh? Same here.\x0e\0\x04\0Having buddies is pretty cool so far.\nI'd definitely recommend it.
W2G1_296	Bobby? What are you doing?\x0e\0\x04\0Don't tell me you got LOST in\nthat tall grass...
W2G1_297	Big M! Ma'am! I knew you'd find me\nsooner or later.\x0e\0\x04\0Reuniting with your buds is pretty\ncool too. I'd definitely recommend it.
W2G1_280	Awww! You met up with your amigos!\nThat's the best.\x0e\0\x04\0Let's have ourselves a super-duper\ncanned-food par-tay to celebrate,\nshy oh my!
W2G1_298	A canned-food...par-tay? That does\nsound like fun!
W2G1_299	Wait! No, no, no! We have to go see\nthe Water Vellumental!\x0e\0\x04\0Come on, Bobby. Say goodbye to\nyour, uh...new friend.
W2G1_300	You got it, ma'am. Let's mosey.
W2G1_282	A super-duper canned-food par-tay!\nCan't wait for my amigos to show\nup...shy oh my!
W2G1_247	Careful! Don't jump! You REALLY\ndon't want to fall from here...
W2G1_99	Oh! Another new buddy!\x0e\0\x04\0He doesn't look like those foldy\nguys, so that means he's friendly.\nRight?
W2G1_176	Hey there, Stompy! I'm Bob-omb.\nWhat's your name?
W2G1_177	Huh. He isn't saying anything.\nMust've lost his memory too...
W2G1_100	BOBBY! NOOOOOO! Oh, I should have\nwarned him about the Paper Macho\nenemies!
W2G1_250	Oh! We're back on Autumn Mountain.\nBut...we still have to find Bobby!
W2G1_308	We made it to the Water Vellumental\nShrine! Hooray!\x0e\0\x04\0Now we can finally meet the Water\nVellumental.
W2G1_309	This definitely looks like the shrine's\nfront door...but how do we open it?
W2G1_310	Oh! I think I've got it, Mario!\x0e\0\x04\0\x0e\x01\x01\0I bet you press both switches at\nthe same time! That has to be it,\nright? Wow, I'm cute AND clever!
W2G1_311	Wait! No! I'm floating...so I can't\npress down on this switch!\x0e\0\x04\0Bobby, you have feet. Come put\nthose things to good use.
W2G1_312	That's what I would tell him...if he\nwere here!\x0e\0\x04\0Didn't he run ahead of us?\nSo he should be here already,\nshouldn't he?\x0e\0\x04\0You don't think he's still lost in the\ntall grass, do you? Oh, Bobby...\x0e\0\x04\0Well, we're not getting into this\nshrine without his adorable little\nfeet. Let's go find him.
W2G1_313	Hang on. We haven't seen Bobby\nsince he fell from the bridge!\x0e\0\x04\0Well, we're not getting into this\nshrine without Bobby's help.\nLet's go find him.
W2G1_316	OK, Bobby. Hop on that switch!
W2G1_342	Gotcha. No sweat.
W2G1_318	Yes! We did it! Now we can go into\nthe shrine!
W2G1_341	Bobby? Aren't you coming into the\nshrine with us?
W2G1_340	Who, me? I'm, uh...pretty wiped\nafter pressing that switch.\nYeah, that's it.\x0e\0\x04\0Definitely not scared to wander into\na dark, dank shrine full of traps and\nmonsters. Nope.\x0e\0\x04\0So. Yeah. I'm gonna sit this one out.\nBut say hi to the Water Vellumental\nfor me! It sounds...wet and horrible,\nI'm just gonna say it.
W2G1_214	Bobby! You really did wait!\x0e\0\x04\0You missed one heck of a show.\nThe Water Vellumental was SO\ncool...and we got a new power!
W2G1_215	R-really? It was actually cool?\nLike...REALLY?\x0e\0\x04\0Huh! So I missed an awesome water\nmonster. That's...fine. That's cool.\nMaybe I'll meet it...some other time...
W2G1_219	Don't worry. You'll see its power in\naction soon enough. Heehee.\x0e\0\x04\0Let's head back to the lake and try\nthe Water Vellumental's ability!
W2G1_57	HA! How do you like THAT, Bobby?\nThat's a looooooot of water, huh?\x0e\0\x04\0Now we can hop on that boat and\nfollow the streamer!
W2G1_101	That was the coolest thing I've ever\nseen! Sorry I doubted you, ma'am!\x0e\0\x04\0I can't believe how many awesome\nnew memories I'm getting today.
W2G1_196	Woo-hoo! Now we can follow that\nblue streamer! Awaaaaaay we go!
W2G1_198	Um...good effort?\x0e\0\x04\0Hey, can I try? I feel kinda bad for\nskipping the shrine, so let me make\nit up to you!
W2G1_199	Oh. Wait. I can't grab the paddle.
W2G1_200	Seriously?! None of us can paddle\nthis boat? After we went to ALL\nthat trouble to fill in the lake?\x0e\0\x04\0There has to be a way! Maybe we\ncan find someone nearby who knows\nhow to row this thing...
W2G1_248	Ooh! How about we ask that happy\nmonkey over there?
W2G1_326	"Eee! Eee!"\x0e\0\x04\0That's monkey for "do you know\nany oarsmen, little guy"?
W2G1_333	Ow! Hey! Is that monkey for "hello"?\nWhat a tough language...
W2G1_249	Aw, shoot! He ran off...\x0e\0\x04\0He didn't even answer my question!
W2G1_274	Hmmm. I dunno. Maybe hurling that\ncan WAS his answer.\x0e\0\x04\0Like, "Stop bugging me, origami lady!\nLet me live my life! Your monkey\naccent is terrible!" Y'know?
W2G1_242	We can either embarrass ourselves\nby flailing this one paddle around...\nor we can find a master oarsman.
W2G1_193	Aha! Found him!
W2G1_169	Should we give something to\nthe monkey?\x0e\x01\x04\x18\x0e\0K\0e\0y\0I\0t\0e\0m\0\xff\xff\xff\xff\0\0\0\0
W2G1_170	I don't think that's what he wants...
W2G1_188	Huh? I thought he loved\ncanned tuna!\x0e\0\x04\0Maybe he wants it...but he can't\nget into the can to enjoy its salted,\nfishy goodness!
W2G1_285	Wow. That little guy sure loves his\ntuna. He's really going to town...\x0e\0\x04\0Maybe he won't run away this time!\nLet's hit him with that oarsman\nquestion!
W2G1_327	Eee, eee, eee! \n(Yum! Tuna always hits the spot.)
W2G1_286	Oh! Mario! Thanks a bunch! I'm REAL\nsorry 'bout all that monkey business.\x0e\0\x04\0Rest assured, I'm no monkey! I jes'\ngot folded up like one!
W2G1_338	I'm the single-oar sculler fer the\nAutumn Mountain downriver tour!\nI was folded fer way too long...\nWent a bit bananas.
W2G1_328	Sculler? Single oar? YOU'RE a\nmaster oarsman?! That's exactly\nwhat we were going to ask about!\x0e\0\x04\0Does that mean you can paddle\nthat boat in the lake?
W2G1_329	Sure does! Did you guys need a ride\ndown the river? I'd be happy to\npaddle fer ya, free of charge!\x0e\0\x04\0I'll be waiting at the dock. Come see\nme when you're ready!
W2G1_339	We did it! Now we can finally ride\nthat boat down the river!
W2G1_181	Is tuna really that good? Maybe I\nshould try it sometime...
W2G1_138	My amigos and I are fired up to have\nour canned-food par-tay here!\x0e\0\x04\0We've got one guy bringing a can\nopener...definitely can't get started\nwithout him.\x0e\0\x04\0I'm afraid he might have gotten lost\nin the tall grass. Could you go find\nhim for me?
W2G1_25	Once my amigos get here, the\ncanned-food par-tay will commence!\x0e\0\x04\0They might have gotten lost in the\ntall grass. Will you go take a look?\nI'd go, but I have to watch our spot.

W2G1_44	You saved me!
W2G1_234	Hey, thanks!
W2G1_46	I'm saved! Thank you!\x0e\0\x04\0It's super comfy in there...like a\nhappy medium between a hug\nand slowly being crushed.
W2G1_49	I wonder if I could have my mail\nforwarded here...
W2G1_233	Thanks! Have you saved all the\nother Toads on Autumn Mountain?\nThere's an easy way to check!\x0e\0\x04\0The map screen in the menu will\nshow you the percentage of rescued\nToads in each area. Neat, huh?
W2G1_48	Another little dragonfly told me\nthat you've been using the 1,000-\nFold Arms technique. That's so cool!\x0e\0\x04\0Are they hard to control, though?\nIf you don't like motion controls,\nyou can turn them off under ⚙\nin the menu.
W2G1_76	Hey, Mario! Sorry I kept running\naway. I panicked.\x0e\0\x04\0At least I learned that I'm pretty\ngood at climbing walls!
W2G1_77	Guh! I thought I had more stamina\nthan this. But hey, at least it isn't\nraining. Hrrrgh!
W2G1_93	Finally! A rescue! I was so lonely\ndown here, all on my own... Here—\nlet me thank you with this!
W2G1_229	So, uh...are you gonna linger? For a\nwhile? That's...fine. I'm just hoping\nto get some alone time soon.
W2G1_179	Wow! How did you find me?\nCould you read my thoughts?\n{s[075]}Are you...reading them now? Please don't.{s[100]}
W2G1_180	Oh, thank goodness! Someone\nfinally found me! Now I know\nhow lost keys must feel...
W2G1_187	Phew! I had given up hope that I'd\never get out of here. Thanks a ton!
W2G1_175	Oh! Thank you! Are we outside the\nWater Vellumental Shrine?\x0e\0\x04\0People say that this shrine is home\nto a massive, terrifying water spirit!\nBut...people say a lot of things.
W2G1_189	It sure is an impressive building,\nisn't it?\x0e\0\x04\0Do you think the Water Vellumental\nis the original shrineowner, or has\nit had some renovations done?
W2G1_51	Phew! That rock almost took me\nout...but there's no way I'd let it\nbeat me. What am I, scissors?
W2G1_235	Wow! This is a beautiful spot!\nAmazing what you miss when\nyou're stuck under a sticker.
W2G1_262	Phew! Good thing I wasn't folded up\non the other side of this bridge.\x0e\0\x04\0If I was stuck in all that tall grass,\nyou might NEVER have found me!\nYou'd need supersensory powers...
W2G1_264	How much loose change d'you think\nis sitting under all that tall grass?\nMust be a dozen couches' worth...
W2G1_269	Phew! Finally. I've been waiting to\nsay this for ages, so listen up...\x0e\0\x04\0You can turn battery-powered items\non and off by pressing ! Isn't that\nincredible?! I've gotta tell everyone!
W2G1_279	Aw, yeah! Mario!
W2G1_281	Ha haa! Nice!
W2G1_293	Appreciating nature RULES!
W2G1_322	Sorry, folks. The tram is closed for\nrepairs. Check back later.

W2G2_222	I don't remember how river tours are\nsupposed to feel, but this one feels\nreally nice.\x0e\x01\0\x04p\x17\0\0
W2G2_223	It is nice...and convenient! We'll just\nfollow this blue streamer all the way\ndown the river. No distractions.\x0e\x01\0\x04p\x17\0\0

W2G2_211	A THEME PARK?! That sounds like so\nmuch fun! Can we go? Please?
W2G2_227	If ya look up ahead, you'll see\nShogun Studios' famous castle!
W2G2_228	Look! The blue streamer wraps all\nthe way around it!\x0e\0\x04\0Wow. Gosh. Imagine that. Of all the\nplaces it could have led us. Hmm.\nWhat to do, what to do...
W2G2_229	Well, Mario...it looks like we HAVE\nto check out Shogun Studios.\nIt would be irresponsible not to.\x0e\0\x04\0So Shogun Studios it is! Right? We're\ngonna stop here, right? Please?
W2G2_132	Heh. Right. I'm sure you'd stay\nTOTALLY on-task in there, ma'am.\n"No distractions," she says...
W2G2_1	We could continue the river tour,\nif ya'd like. Sweetpaper Valley is\njes' up ahead. What'll it be?\x0e\x01\x04\x18\x0e\0W\02\0G\02\0_\02\01\0\xff\xff\xff\xff\0\0\0\0

W2G2_10	WHAT?! We're not going to\nShogun Studios? But...but...
W2G2_133	HOORAY! I knew you wouldn't need\nconvincing, Mario!
W2G2_213	OK, then! You folks go have fun.\nI'll be waitin' here when you're done!
W2G2_507	Yesss! Oh, we're gonna have SO\nmuch fun in Shogun Studios!
W2G2_212	Yeah...she's not even thinking\nabout the streamer anymore.
W2G2_157	Are you serious? We're not gonna\ngo in? But Shogun Studios is right\nhere! Aww!
W2G2_158	{s[075]}Shogun Studios...{s[100]}
W2G2_3	What in the— Where'd this thing\ncome from? We can't pass through\nthe gate with this in the way!
W2G2_135	Oh! And there's the yellow streamer\nlurking right behind it!\x0e\0\x04\0I guess there's no other option.\nWe have to take care of this blue\nstreamer first. Which means...
W2G2_122	Yep. We'll have to turn around and\nhead back fer now.
W2G2_92	I guess we have to check out\nShogun Studios after all, huh?
W2G2_95	We do? My goodness! I guess you're\nright, Bobby! What a great idea. So\nglad you thought of it.
W2G2_139	Ahoy! What'll it be?\x0e\x01\x04\x18\x0e\0W\02\0G\02\0_\02\01\0\x05\0\0\0\0\0\0\0

W2G2_15	Huh?\x0e\0\x04\0THIS is Shogun Studios? Where is\neveryone?!\x0e\0\x04\0Is the park closed today?
W2G2_37	I don't think they'd have let us in\nif the park were closed, ma'am.\x0e\0\x04\0But it is a little quiet around here.\nMaybe everyone's at a performance\nor something...
W2G2_16	Psst! Over here, fellow park visitors...
W2G2_232	You must come this way. Quickly!
W2G2_17	We're not going to ignore that other\nvisitor, are we, Mario?
W2G2_148	We cannot stay out in the open.\x0e\0\x04\0Time runs short. This way!\nQuickly, quickly!
W2G2_18	Tabi-no-okata... You who are on a\njourney... I'm afraid we must humbly\nbeg for your help!\x0e\0\x04\0You see, Shogun Studios has been\novertaken by a band of origami\nhooligans!
W2G2_19	Hai! Those fiends captured most of\nthe staff here and trapped them in\nthe oshiro—the park's main castle!
W2G2_20	Yeah! It's the pits, man! We got all\ndressed up for a fun day here and—\x0e\0\x04\0Oops. I mean, uh...\x0e\0\x04\0Forsooth, we cannot let our pricey\nentry fees go to waste. We totally\nbeg of ye to help us! Prithee?
W2G2_23	Folded Soldiers? Here?! How dare\nthose fiends disrupt the peace and\nsanctity of Shogun Studios!
W2G2_39	You said they're in the castle, right?\nThat's where the streamer leads, so\nwe've already got business there!\x0e\0\x04\0Mario-dono! Bobunosuke-dono!\nLet us make haste! To the castle!
W2G2_40	That settles it. We can't move on\nuntil we deal with the streamer.\nDestiny has guided us here!\x0e\0\x04\0Mario-dono! Bobunosuke-dono!\nLet us make haste! To the castle!
W2G2_134	Wow. You're REALLY getting into\nthis role-playing thing, ma'am.\x0e\0\x04\0I guess you're right. There won't be\nanything to watch or play without\nthe staff, so...on to the castle!
W2G2_22	Hey, Mario! Fancy meetin' you\nfolks here!
W2G2_24	I was gonna scoot downriver and\nscout ahead, but lookee here!\x0e\0\x04\0This blue streamer is blockin' the\nway. I can't paddle around it!
W2G2_147	Aha! Look! The yellow streamer\nis waiting just past this gate!\x0e\0\x04\0I guess there's no other option.\nWe have to take care of the blue\nstreamer first.
W2G2_110	The castle stands tall at the end\nof the park's main thoroughfare.
W2G2_214	The staff has been abducted...\nThe park has been overrun...\nWhat an ill twist of fate.
W2G2_215	We beg you! Please rescue the park\nstaff from the castle!\x0e\0\x04\0Today, if possible. I wanna do\nSOMETHING fun before sundown!
W2G2_27	Ooooh! Now THAT is an imposing\ncastle. It looks over the entire park!\x0e\0\x04\0The Toads that work here are being\nheld captive inside, right?
W2G2_494	OK, you two! Let's rescue the staff,\nget rid of the streamer, and save\nthe park so we can have some FUN!
W2G2_216	The gate won't open!
W2G2_219	She could have just...knocked...
W2G2_501	Heyyy! Anybody in theeeere?\nSorry I slammed into your dooooor!\nPlease open the gaaaaate!
W2G2_269	I don't think those Folded Soldiers\nare gonna open up for us, ma'am.
W2G2_217	OK, so...I'm clearly bad at this.\x0e\0\x04\0This gate is too big and heavy for\nmy tiny folds. Mario-dono, may I\nrequest your assistance?
W2G2_426	\x0e\x03\x01\x04\x9a\x99\x99>Open!\x0f\x03\x01
W2G2_270	Heyyy, good effort. I'd lend a hand\nmyself, but...well, you know.\x0e\0\x04\0Huh?
W2G2_255	Look! There's a keyhole here.
W2G2_218	Huh! How did I miss that?\x0e\0\x04\0If there's a keyhole, then we just\nhave to find the key. Easy peasy!
W2G2_498	But that key could be hiding\nanywhere, ma'am!
W2G2_508	Oh. That's...a little less easy.\x0e\0\x04\0This park is huge. I guess we'd\nbetter start searching...
W2G2_62	How is THAT gonna open the gate?
W2G2_29	Hey! Couldn't help but overhear\nyour little chat about that key.\nLet me save you some time.\x0e\0\x04\0Staff members have to lock up each\narea of the park before clocking out\nfor the night.\x0e\0\x04\0If you can find the staff room here,\nI bet you'll find that gate key!\x0e\0\x04\0Don't ask how I know. It's not like I\nhide here overnight to gorge myself\non dumplings or anything...
W2G2_30	Staff members have to lock up each\narea of the park before clocking out\nfor the night.\x0e\0\x04\0If you can find the staff room here,\nI bet you'll find that gate key.
W2G2_344	Aah! You ruined my plan! I was going\nto wait until night, then shake loose\nand gorge myself on dumplings...
W2G2_399	I hate to say it, but the show inside\nthis castle was WAY more exciting\nbefore the park got saved.
W2G2_123	Mario! You saved me!\nOh, thank goodness!
W2G2_104	Those Folded Soldiers locked me up\nbecause I work here! They cornered\neven more of us in the staff room.\x0e\0\x04\0I'm so worried... Will you go check on\nthem? You can find the staff room\nin the east side of the park.\x0e\0\x04\0The entrance is hidden. Visitors\nwere getting...bold...so we had\nto get a bit sneaky.
W2G2_137	You can find the staff room in\nthe eastern side of this park.\nThe entrance is hidden!
W2G2_346	Have you climbed to the top of this\ntower and rung the bell yet? It's fun\nfor you AND your hammer!
W2G2_427	Mario! Thank goodness you're here!\x0e\0\x04\0Shogun Studios has been invaded\nby origami! It's so, so thematically\nappropriate—I mean, horrible!\x0e\0\x04\0This staff room has everything you'll\nneed to infiltrate the main castle.\nEspecially the—\x0e\0\x04\0*gasp*

W2G2_417	Stop screaming everything!\nWe're right here.
W2G2_418	Oh. Sorry, little fella. That key is\njust super, SUPER important!\x0e\0\x04\0It's a master key that can open\nEVERY door in Shogun Studios!
W2G2_421	EVERY door? Whoa! That key is like\nthe ruler over all other park keys!\x0e\0\x04\0We need that key. If it's missing...\nwe have no choice but to track it\ndown ourselves.
W2G2_460	Do you mean this key? We already\nfound it, random unnamed staff-\nmember Toad!
W2G2_461	Wh-what? Really? That's great!\nNow I won't get fired!\x0e\0\x04\0Please, hang on to that key!\nI'll rest easier knowing it's in your\nhands, Mario.
W2G2_422	Who could have run off with that\nmaster key?
W2G2_462	We did it, random unnamed staff-\nmember Toad! We found the master\nkey to the whole park!
W2G2_463	Please hang on to that master key!\nAnd I DO have a name... You hero\ntypes just never ask.
W2G2_382	Thank you!
W2G2_267	Halt! Who goes there?
W2G2_438	Oh! It's you, Mario. Sorry! I thought\nyou were another intruder!\x0e\0\x04\0I saw a suspicious character duck\nin here while I was folded up.\x0e\0\x04\0He was wearing green clothes and\na green hat. That's an EXTREMELY\nsuspicious color, y'know?
W2G2_439	Green clothes, green hat...\nThis guy searched the whole room.\nEXTREMELY suspicious character.
W2G2_384	You saved me!
W2G2_45	\x0e\x01\x03\x04\x03\0\0\0Aw, that's a miss. Zzz...\nBetter luck next time...
W2G2_294	GUH! Mario? H-hello!
W2G2_432	I run the Shuriken Dojo. It's our most\npopular attraction! I'm usually super\nbusy, but...\x0e\0\x04\0We had ZERO visitors today, so I was\njust, uh...resting my eyes in here.\x0e\0\x04\0Guess I'd better hurry back to the\nShuriken Dojo. Stop by and check\nit out! No lines today!
W2G2_433	Just to be clear, I wasn't sleeping!\nIn fact, I worked through my lunch\nbreak! I-I'm still on the clock!
W2G2_226	Wow! It's Mario! Welcome to\nShogun Studios!\x0e\0\x04\0Or welcome to the staff room of\nShogun Studios, I guess.\x0e\0\x04\0This is where we store equipment\nbetween productions. These masks\nare just gathering dust back here.\x0e\0\x04\0Feel free to try 'em on, take 'em\nwith you... Do whatever you want!\nI don't get paid enough to stop you.
W2G2_69	We're not using these masks for\nanything. Feel free to try 'em on,\ntake 'em with you... Go nuts.
W2G2_315	What in the world is this? A huge\nface? Looks like you could wear it...
W2G2_65	Why don't you try it on, Mario?
W2G2_434	Heh.\x0e\0\x04\0Heh... Hehehe...
W2G2_316	\x0e\x02\0\0{s[120]}HAHAHAHA!{s[100]}\x0f\x02\0
W2G2_436	Ha ha ha!
W2G2_296	Wow. She really, really needs\nto get out more.
W2G2_297	Oh, come on! This is hilarious!\x0e\0\x04\0Mario? Wearing the head of a super-\nscary Paper Macho Soldier? He looks\nso wobbly and silly!\x0e\0\x04\0Ha ha, it's just so...goofy! Ha ha ha!
W2G2_437	Goofy! Ha ha!
W2G2_298	Wow, Big M! You're a comedic genius!\x0e\0\x04\0I guess this'll come in handy if we\never need to send her into a full-on\ngiggle fit...
W2G2_435	Hoo! That was SO funny. I laughed\nso much that my creases started\nto crinkle! Heh.
W2G2_307	Wow! What animal IS that?\x0e\0\x04\0That thumping sounds like,\n"DONK, DONK!"
W2G2_313	It looks strong. Is it banging a\ngong? Y'know, like, "KLONG!"\x0e\0\x04\0Nah. I must be...mistaken.
W2G2_306	Huh. There's something you don't\nsee every day.\x0e\0\x04\0He certainly looks intimidating!\nIs he...battling something?
W2G2_312	Looks like he's firing beams from his\nhand! That's pretty cool...but not\nexactly Big M's style.\x0e\0\x04\0It'd probably look perfect on some\nother kind of M, though.
W2G2_98	Aaah! So scary!\x0e\0\x04\0How can something so round and\ncute be so frightening?
W2G2_196	BARK! BARK BARK!
W2G2_495	Oh! It's you, Mario!
W2G2_151	Good timing! I spotted something\nthat gave me paws.\x0e\0\x04\0This guy in a fetching green outfit\nruffed—I mean, rushed into the\nninja house over there.\x0e\0\x04\0He was really woofin'—I mean,\nhoofin' it! Must be something\ngood in there.
W2G2_149	That guy in green went into the\nninja house! Must be something\ngood in there...
W2G2_440	Aha! Our mysterious man in green!\nSounds like we're hot on his trail.
W2G2_349	I wonder if they'd let me chew on\nthat bone... J-just a little bit...
W2G2_48	All of the serving glasses here are\nshort and flat. I don't know how\nanyone drinks from these things.\x0e\0\x04\0That's why I always carry my\nemergency sippin' straw!\x0e\0\x04\0I'll let you borrow it, but...you\nmight wanna wipe it off first.
W2G2_174	This tea is so bitter. Blech. Should\nhave gotten a soda like I usually do.
W2G2_50	You think that guy would rather\nhave a sippy cup or what?
W2G2_52	I thought we were training with\nshuriken today...but it's actually\nreed-pipe day. Oh, my shame!
W2G2_101	I don't want to fall behind!\nThere has to be something I can\nuse to breathe underwater...\x0e\x01\x04\x18\x0e\0K\0e\0y\0I\0t\0e\0m\0\xff\xff\xff\xff\0\0\0\0

W2G2_53	Whoa! It's...it's perfect! It's like this\ntube was MADE for the ninja arts!\x0e\0\x04\0I propose a trade. Your breathing\ntube for my shuriken. How about it?\x0e\x01\x04\x14\n\0y\0e\0s\0n\0o\0\x01\0\0\0\0\0\0\0
W2G2_55	Oh. How regrettable...
W2G2_56	Yes! Thank you, thank you!\nMy shuriken are all yours.
W2G2_248	Ackpth! Blech...ptooey!\nWhy does this reed pipe taste like\ntea...with a smack of soda?
W2G2_59	Oh! Hey, Mario. I came back to open\nthe Shuriken Dojo, but...\x0e\0\x04\0Somebody swiped my shuriken!\x0e\0\x04\0Ugh! What am I supposed to do now,\njust hope I run into some maniac\ncarryin' a spare set of shuriken?\x0e\x01\x04\x18\x0e\0K\0e\0y\0I\0t\0e\0m\0\xff\xff\xff\xff\0\0\0\0

W2G2_60	Whoa, Mario! You have shuriken on\nyou? That's questionable...but very\nconvenient for me!\x0e\0\x04\0I know what you're gonna ask.\n"Can this guy FINALLY open the\nShuriken Dojo now?"\x0e\0\x04\0Heh. I SURE CAN!\n{s[075]}Shoot, I messed that up.{s[100]}
W2G2_68	Can we back up? What is this place?
W2G2_102	This Shuriken Dojo lets folks test\ntheir skill by hurling shuriken at\na set of targets.\x0e\0\x04\0If you can clear normal mode, you'll\nwin a baseball signed by a genuine\nsports superstar!
W2G2_108	Ooh! That sounds like fun! Can we\ntry it, Mario?
W2G2_113	Since you helped me out, I'll let you\npractice for free. Step right up!\x0e\0\x04\0Which mode would you like to try?

W2G2_184	Let's see if you can get 10 or more\npoints within the time limit. Ready?\nPractice mode, BEGIN!
W2G2_274	To clear normal mode, you'll need to\nscore EXACTLY 21 points.\x0e\0\x04\0If you go over 21 points, you'll have\nto adjust your score back down by\nhitting the negative-number targets.
W2G2_185	Ready for normal mode? Remember,\nyou have to get EXACTLY 21 points.\nAaaaand...begin!
W2G2_275	To clear expert mode, you'll need\nto get 80 or more points within the\ntime limit.\x0e\0\x04\0We'll also record your high score,\nso don't hold back! Let's see how\nhigh you can go, Mario!

W2G2_206	Time's up! You got...\x0e\x03\0\x04\0\0\0\0 points. Oh.\x0e\0\x04\0You didn't get 10 points this time,\nbut that's what practice is for!\nGive it another shot!
W2G2_187	Twenty-one points exactly! Go, you!\nYou cleared normal mode!
W2G2_188	Time's up! You got...\x0e\x03\0\x04\0\0\0\0 points.\nThat's...not 21, so you didn't clear\nnormal mode. Sorry!\x0e\0\x04\0Look carefully at the points on each\ntarget before launching a shuriken.\nYou want to get EXACTLY 21 points!
W2G2_204	Time's up! You got...\x0e\x03\0\x04\0\0\0\0 points!

W2G2_190	Congrats! Here's your prize!
W2G2_191	Wow! Eighty points or more is a\nrare feat, so here's an exclusive,\none-time-only, extraspecial prize!
W2G2_192	Amazing work! Eighty points or more\nmeans...you've won another prize!

W2G2_175	Mario?! Wow! I've been a big fan\nfor a long time!
W2G2_78	Be sure to keep a 1-Up Mushroom in\nyour inventory. It'll revive you one\ntime if you lose all your HP in battle!\x0e\0\x04\0They're must-have items if you're\nabout to fight a tough enemy!
W2G2_109	The guy who runs the Shuriken Dojo\nis always missing.\x0e\0\x04\0Maybe he's hiding out in the staff\nroom again? Probably napping on\nthe job...
W2G2_145	The Shuriken Dojo Toad is back!\nGuess someone gave him a wake-up\ncall. Heh heh.
W2G2_79	If you're feeling lost, just check the\ninformation board outside! It's your\nguide to all of Shogun Studios.
W2G2_82	I heard the Shuriken Dojo behind\nhere has some great prizes! I just\nwish someone else was running it.
W2G2_81	Wha?! My favorite zabuton was\nstolen! AGAIN!
W2G2_265	Phew! I snagged a zabuton just\nin time.
W2G2_266	We've been playing musical chairs\nwith our zabutons! That's a kind of\ncushion used to sit on tatami mats.
W2G2_493	Fun, Funky, and Functional\nAccessories! You need 'em, I've\ngot 'em!\x0e\0\x04\0I'll be selling my goods in front of\nthe souvenir shop. The staff here\nhates it when I do that. Heh heh.

W2G2_277	HUH? DID YOU SAY SOMETHING?\nI CAN'T HEAR ANYTHING. I THINK\nIT WAS THE BELL.

W2G2_152	Thanks for fishing with us today!\x0e\0\x04\0Looks like you hooked a handful of\nfakes...so here's a consolation prize\nof \x0e\x03\0\x04\0\0\0\0 coins!
W2G2_114	HEY! What'd you do THAT for?\nI was happy in that river! I had\nfriends! I was popular! Aw, maaan...
W2G2_162	This gig is rough, so I've learned to\nappreciate a nice, slooooooow tea\nbreak. Mmmmmm-mmmmmmmmmmm.
W2G2_64	Someone REAL suspicious was\nheading for the ol' ninja house.
W2G2_350	Is that cosplaying Koopa lost?\nIt looks like they need a tour guide...\nand about another week's work on\nthat costume.\x0e\0\x04\0Please don't tell them I said that.
W2G2_43	A bunch of staff members have been\npassing through here. The staff room\nmust be nearby!
W2G2_36	That big building across the river is\nthe House of Tricky Ninjas.\x0e\0\x04\0I swore to never go back there...\nbut my teacher must be avenged.\x0e\0\x04\0They lost their glasses in there once.
W2G2_44	Do your 1,000-Fold Arms feel off-\ncenter? If they do, just press \nto reset their orientation!\x0e\0\x04\0Wondering how I knew about that?\nHey. Don't worry about it.
W2G2_34	That area back there doesn't seem\nlike an attraction. Is it staff only?\x0e\0\x04\0Oooh, I gotta know! I love knowing\nabout stuff I'm not supposed to.
W2G2_90	Pffft! Pffsh! I'm saved...but my\nmouth tastes like ash!
W2G2_91	I'm in dire need of refreshment!\nMaybe some tea will get the taste\nof soot out of my mouth. Blech!
W2G2_83	I saw this weird guy inside the\nTranquil Pipes Teahouse who\ndrinks tea with a straw...

W2G2_386	Hmm, what should I do next? Ooh,\nI know! I'll ask the Info Center for\na recommendation! I can't WAIT!

W3C1_4	He's just...gone...\x0e\0\x04\0I'm too sad to move.
W3C1_144	Jackpot, baby! Some kinda huge\nrock exploded outside!\x0e\0\x04\0We just gathered up all of the\npieces to see if we could find\nsomethin' shiny for Bowser.\x0e\0\x04\0I dunno what could blow up a rock\nthat big, and I don't care.

W3C1_44	Oh...oh, I needed that.\nThank you, Mario.\x0e\0\x04\0I can't just sit around wallowing\nin misery. Bobby wouldn't have\nwanted that!

W3C1_129	{s[150]}Boot Car Type B{s[100]}
W3C1_160	Output: 150 Yoshis
W3C1_161	Top Speed: Golden Mushroom
W3C1_118	Feast your eyes on the Boot Car\nType B racer!\x0e\0\x04\0It eats up desert terrain like\na tourist at a buffet!\x0e\0\x04\0And when you hit that turbo\nbutton? Hoo-eeee! Better hold\non to your mustache, cowboy!
W3C1_119	Now, the least I can do is offer\nyou a no-coins-down test ride.\x0e\0\x04\0By accepting this whistle, you've\nagreed to the terms and conditions\nof our Not-a-Lease Lease™.
W3C1_162	Just blow the whistle and the\ncar'll come tearin' outta nowhere\nto take you where you wanna go.\x0e\0\x04\0Just stick to the desert, OK? Those\ntires aren't rated for other types\nof terrain.\x0e\0\x04\0No need to read or understand the\ndetails of your Not-a-Lease Lease™.\nIf the shoe fits, drive it! Hop on in!
W3C1_151	Just go on over and press \nto hop in!
W3C1_130	Lookin' good!\x0e\0\x04\0Now, I'm sure you know how to\nhandle a fine vehicle like this, but\nlemme just give you some pointers.\x0e\0\x04\0Use  to steer, and if you wanna\nblow the hairs on your mustache\nback, hold down  to hit the turbo.\x0e\0\x04\0Keep that button mashed, and you'll\nbe movin' fast enough to break stuff\nand take out Folded Soldiers!\x0e\0\x04\0Just, uh...mind the paint job, OK?
W3C1_120	How's the ol' Boot Car treating\nya? Nothin' like puttin' the pedal\ndown with , huh? Zowie!
W3C1_122	Whoa, whoa, whoa! That Boot Car\nisn't rated for tunnel use, bub.\nHit the desert if you wanna ride!
W3C1_173	Whoa, hey there. Us Monty Moles\ndon't get many guests down here\nin our little tunnel. Ah, we could do\na better job advertisin'...
W3C1_131	Whoa, hey there. Us Monty Moles\ndon't get many guests down here\nin our little tunnel. Ah, we could do\na better job advertisin'...\x0e\0\x04\0Funny, though...you're not the\nfirst today. A giant bee with\ntears runnin' down its face just\nbuzzed past.
W3C1_146	You lookin' for what I assume is\na giant bee with tears runnin'\ndown its face? It went thataway.
W3C1_145	If anyone asks, I broke that giant\nrock up, OK? It was ME!
W3C1_150	You...you get that cryin' bee\nor whatever taken care of?\nGood luck, pal.
W3C1_134	You never know what you're gonna\nfind when you start diggin'. That's\nwhat I love about it!
W3C1_135	Bowser says dig for shiny stuff,\nwe dig! You dig?
W3C1_136	Where is Bowser, anyway? It ain't\nlike the big guy to disappear for\nso long.
W3C1_143	Whaddaya want from me?\nI'm on my break!
W3C1_15	What's the big idea?\nI'm diggin' here!
W3C1_26	How'd you like it if I came down to\nyour work and put on some overalls\nand... Wait, what do you even do?
W3C1_27	Ah, you got me—you saved me.\nI was just pretendin' to work.\nYay, Mario. My hero.\x0e\0\x04\0Look, if I give you somethin', will\nyou just go away?
W3C1_28	That's it! I got nothin' else for you.
W3C1_155	You that Mario guy I've heard\nabout before? Nice whiskers, bud.
W3C1_137	Did you make that bee girl cry?\nWe moles don't take kindly to\nbee bullies!
W3C1_157	Aww, I heard that bee girl laughin'\nher wings off. Was that you? I guess\nyou're not so bad.
W3C1_139	I crawled into that rock to take\na nap. That was three years ago.\x0e\0\x04\0Thanks for the wake-up, pal.\nHere's a little somethin' for\nthe effort.
W3C1_163	Oh baby... I hope I'm still clocked in!
W3C1_165	You did it! You found the\nCave of Break Dancing!\x0e\0\x04\0Just kidding. It's a bathroom.\nAnd I'm dancing for nonbathroom\nrelated reasons.
W3C1_140	We dig hard and we play hard!\nBut this? This is just mandatory\nteam yoga.
W3C1_149	You watch, I'm gonna touch my\ntoes one of these years!
W3C1_141	Hey, you from aboveground? My big\nbro couldn't shovel it anymore down\nhere so he moved up there.\x0e\0\x04\0Last I heard he was sellin' trinkets\non the roadside. You see him, you\ntell him he stinks! And I love him.
W3C1_159	Watch it, pal! Keep them dirty\nboots off the goods!
W3C1_147	Wha...what was I folded into?\nA scoop or a shovel?\x0e\0\x04\0IT MATTERS TO ME!
W3C3.msbt
W3C3_18	Aaah! Aaah!\x0e\0\x04\0So that's why the bird's mouth\nwas glowing from the outside.\nEverything's on fire in here!\x0e\0\x04\0Wait!
W3C3_17	You know what I just realized?\x0e\0\x04\0Doing that song and dance\nthat the mural taught us is \nkind of like knocking on the\nFire Vellumental's front door!\x0e\0\x04\0And that means...
W3C3_40	The Fire Vellumental might be here...\nAnd we might get to meet it!
W3C3_36	You don't seem surprised. Did you\nalready know that or something?
W3C3_39	And you just let me keep talking?!\nHow funny of you, Mario!
W3C3_29	I must say, this Fire Vellumental\nbusiness is not my area of expertise.\x0e\0\x04\0Despite my curiosity, I'm afraid\nI must sit this one out, as they say.\x0e\0\x04\0Unrelated... Have I mentioned\nthat I have a deep and debilitating\nfear of fire?
W3C3_26	Oh, Professor! You should have\nsaid something earlier.\x0e\0\x04\0Why don't you wait here and try\nnot to catch on fire while Mario\nsorts this out?
W3C3_37	Don't leave without me!
W3C3_38	{s[075]}...I'm allergic to fire. I'll wait here.{s[100]}
W3C3_6	Did you hear that sound?
W3C3_7	It's the Fire Vellumental, all right.\x0e\0\x04\0Look at it burn! But it's not burning\nup... What an amazing creature!\x0e\0\x04\0Oh, but the poor thing has been\nfolded into origami. Mario, we've\ngot to cool it down somehow!
W3C3_11	Aha! There it is! The Fire\nVellumental's Bibliofold!
W3C3_13	You're not going to leave without\nthe Bibliofold, are you?
W3C3_12	Oh wow... This one is the most\nchallenging yet!\x0e\0\x04\0Those wings! The combination of\nmountain and valley folds! The\nimprobable fire resistance!
W3C3_22	Well...I think I've got the concept\ndown. But can I do it for real?\nMy heart's pounding!
W3C3_19	Oh...oh my!\x0e\0\x04\0Remember how I said my heart was\npounding? Well...now it kinda feels\nlike it's...
W3C3_30	\x0e\x02\0\0{s[150]}on fire!{s[100]}\x0f\x02\0
W3C3_20	I just...let all the fire that was\nburning in my chest come out...\nand look what happened!
W3C3_33	Whoa! It looks like those birdies\ngot caught up in the heat of the\nmoment. What a spectacle!
W3C3_41	I think those fire-breathing birds are\nshowing us the way out, Mario.
W3C3_34	Perhaps I should have taken my\nchances... No, no. A fiery temple\nfilled with pitfalls is no place for a\nprofessor like me.
W3C3_9	Professor! We're back!
W3C3_35	Oh, thank goodness! I was just\nbeginning to question my career\nchoices.
W3C3_32	You won't believe this. We met the\nFire Vellumental!\x0e\0\x04\0It's a giant bird! And I turned INTO\nthe bird! Oh, my heart is still racing.
W3C3_24	Is that so? Well...it was very\nexciting out here too.\x0e\0\x04\0Yes...I watched the flames intently.\nAnd I...sweated quite profusely.\nHad to wring myself out a few times.\x0e\0\x04\0In any case... Well done, Olivia!\nHere's hoping your newfound\navian affinity proves useful to us.
W3C3_27	Try hitting it with your hammer, Mario!\x0e\x01\0\x04\x88\x13\0\0
W3C4.msbt
W3C4_1	Goodness! This must be the\nTemple of Shrooms itself!\x0e\0\x04\0So this is what it meant by "desert\nsand entombs." Ah, the Ancient Ones\ndid love a good cryptic hint...
W3C4_182	Now that the temple is awake,\ndo you think we can follow the\nstreamer? It leads into the\ncrack, see?
W3C4_183	You're right—the streamer certainly\nappears to terminate inside the\ntemple.\x0e\0\x04\0Come on, let's go find the entrance!
W3C4_206	We aren't going to be able to\nget past here until we get rid\nof the streamer!
W3C4_171	Hmm, yes... It seems that this may\nbe the final resting place of the\nancient King Shroomses!\x0e\0\x04\0I've also discovered that a sort of\nsafety mechanism was responsible\nfor burying the temple in the sand.\x0e\0\x04\0When the sun went out, the\ntemple retreated into the earth\nfor safekeeping.
W3C4_209	Oh! So the temple wasn't just\ntaking a nap or something?
W3C4_214	Er...no. It's a king's temple, so it was\ndesigned this way to ward off\nintruders, interlopers, infidels, and,\ner...UNauthorized visitors.\x0e\0\x04\0IN any case, we should be quite\ncareful as we explore. This temple\nis almost certainly rigged with traps.
W3C4_210	Wahhh! Spiders!
W3C4_211	Mario! Don't you care that there\nare spiders on you?!
W3C4_130	Ah. A dead end. Or is it?\nIn archaeology, one never knows...
W3C4_6	{c[e67928]}\x0e\x02\0\0The left sign is more useful.\x0f\x02\0{c[404040]}
W3C4_8	Ah, this one is very complex.\x0e\0\x04\0The grammar is of an ancient type,\neven for ancient writing! Goodness,\neven the interrobangs have been\nreversed...\x0e\0\x04\0This will take me some time,\nI'm afraid.
W3C4_9	?! or !? It's all so confusing...
W3C4_86	{c[e67928]}\x0e\x02\0\0Thgir ngis thgir eht si!?\x0f\x02\0\n\x0e\x02\0\0Thgir dna tfel eht htob no teg tsuj\x0f\x02\0\n\x0e\x02\0\0rood eht nepo ot ecno ta sdnah.\x0f\x02\0{c[404040]}
W3C4_10	Can you keep that racket down\nwhile I'm translating! Now, where\nwas I...
W3C4_11	Whoa! When did that happen?!
W3C4_83	To be honest, I could spend a few\nmore hours on the left set of text,\nbut I suppose the time isn't right.\x0e\0\x04\0Very well! Onward!
W3C4_85	No! I'm afraid of being left behind\nin an ancient temple!
W3C4_246	It's quite dark in here, even for\nan ancient temple...\x0e\0\x04\0As a scholar and scientist, I don't\nbelieve in ghosts or similar nonsense.\nBut I don't like this feeling...
W3C4_184	\x0e\x02\0\0{s[150]}Show yourself, ghoul!{s[100]}\x0f\x02\0
W3C4_132	Gah! It was my own shadow.\nOh, this isn't good...
W3C4_131	OK, now tell me you saw THAT.\x0e\0\x04\0Was it just a strange shadow?\nYou can't tell me it's just my\nimagination!
W3C4_136	Was it something? Tell me it was\nnothing! I must make it out of here\nto publish my findings...
W3C4_251	Mario! What hit you? Logic dictates\nthat this "isn't a thing," but...could\nit have been the temple's curse?!
W3C4_250	Did you hear that? It sounded like\nsomeone said "whap," which is the\nancient word for "I've got you now,\nmustache boy!" We must be vigilant.
W3C4_134	Now mummies?!
W3C4_135	Oh, uh... Thank you for taking\ncare of that.\x0e\0\x04\0I would have helped, of course, but\nI'm literally terrified of my own\nshadow, as you have seen.
W3C4_146	Whoa! Look out for all of those\nholes! Be careful, Mario...
W3C4_15	How curious... What could possibly\nbe attracting the attention of\nthat many spiders?
W3C4_13	Oh! There's a pair of twitching\nToad's feet in the middle of those\nspiders!
W3C4_14	Won't you help, Mario?
W3C4_17	Oh, you poor thing.\nAre you all right?
W3C4_18	\x0e\x02\0\0{s[150]}Nooooope!{s[100]}\x0f\x02\0
W3C4_22	The Toad's face!
W3C4_19	Is this Toad not all right? Everything\nlooks normal from here...\x0e\0\x04\0Toad? Did something happen to\nyour face?
W3C4_20	\x0e\x02\0\0{s[150]}TOAD'S FACE IS GONE!{s[100]}\x0f\x02\0
W3C4_137	Toad's face is gone...Toad's gone \nis face...is gone Toad's face...gone\nface Toad's is...\x0e\0\x04\0Toad's face...is just...NOT THERE.\nOh, I hope it doesn't hurt...
W3C4_138	Oh! I think the Toad is trying to\ntalk to us!\x0e\0\x04\0Toad! Can you hear me? You still\nhave ears somewhere in your...\nhead, would we call it? Or is it\na hat? Anyway, say something!
W3C4_213	Toad's face is gone...
W3C4_140	Ah...I guess no face means no mouth.\x0e\0\x04\0Now, who would do this to a poor\nToad for no reason?
W3C4_23	{c[e67928]}\x0e\x02\0\0Personal Interment Number: 1 4 2 3\x0f\x02\0{c[404040]}
W3C4_157	Hm?
W3C4_158	Wha?!
W3C4_142	Eeeek! What is all of that?!
W3C4_156	I am an archaeologist, not an\narachnologist, but...it seems to\nbe a massive spiderweb.
W3C4_161	Well, I don't like the looks of it\nat all. Those poor Toads!\x0e\0\x04\0Unfortunately, I don't think we\ncan help them from here. Maybe\nwe can get below them somehow...
W3C4_87	Hey, you found some kind of shiny\ndisc. It's pretty!
W3C4_89	Is that one of those discs the\nDJ was talking about? It's so\nshiny and beautiful... Oooh...
W3C4_24	{c[e67928]}\x0e\x02\0\0A star lights your way...\x0f\x02\0{c[404040]}
W3C4_193	\x0e\x03\x02\0Hold it!\x0f\x03\x02
W3C4_205	\x0e\x03\x02\0We gotta frisk ya. Hey, it's a job.\x0f\x03\x02
W3C4_79	\x0e\x03\x02\0Mighty fine \x0e\x03\0\x04\0\0\0\0\nya had there...\x0f\x03\x02
W3C4_143	Well, this is fun!\x0e\0\x04\0I don't know what's happening,\nbut my hips suddenly started\nshaking by themselves!
W3C4_145	I...I'm at a loss for words. This is\nunlike anything I've ever seen in my\nstudy of the antiquities...\x0e\0\x04\0And that crown jewel in the\ncenter of the ceiling is simply\nstunning! I wonder what's inside...\nDare I say...it belongs...
W3C4_147	Sorry to interrupt, Professor, but\nthere's the streamer!\x0e\0\x04\0It looks like it's going into that door,\ndoesn't it?
W3C4_149	\x0e\x02\0\0{s[150]}Hey! DJ!{s[100]}\x0f\x02\0
W3C4_150	You call that music? I call it\na racket!\x0e\0\x04\0Stop scratchin' around, and put\non somethin' I can dance to!\x0e\0\x04\0If I ain't movin' to the groove when\nthe needle drops, I'm gonna collect\nyour face like a limited-edition\nseven-inch single!
W3C4_196	Yo, yo, yo! Don't do that! I'll queue\nup something...groovy...with the\nquickness, my man!
W3C4_192	Mario! You've got to save me! This\nguy is such a weirdo! He keeps\nasking for "groovy" music to "cut\na rug" to.\x0e\0\x04\0Do I look like I'm 100 years old?\nI'm a DJ, man! I have no idea what\nthat means!\x0e\0\x04\0My face is at stake here, y'all.\nMY FACE. You've got to help!
W3C4_152	No! Not your face! That's where\nyou put your sunglasses!\x0e\0\x04\0Anyway, what's wrong with the song\nthat was just playing? I happen to\nthink it was QUITE groovy.
W3C4_190	I don't know...this guy's taste in\nmusic makes no sense to me, but\nhe is VERY opinionated.\x0e\0\x04\0He doesn't like any of the music\nthat I put on, and he won't come\nout of that room.
W3C4_153	Anyway, here's how you can help.\nI dropped some of my sound discs\non the way in here.\x0e\0\x04\0Maybe one of those discs has a\ntune this guy will actually like.\x0e\0\x04\0I'll try to buy some time while\nyou're looking. Just get those\ndiscs and bring 'em back to me.\nThere are four of them, yo!
W3C4_189	Ooh! Whoever is in that room is\nthe one taking all of these poor\nToads' faces.\x0e\0\x04\0So we've got to get him out of\nthat room and somehow reface\nthose Toads!\x0e\0\x04\0But what kind of music is groovy\nenough to get him out of there?
W3C4_42	My hips aren't shaking! Don't you\ndare open this door unless you've\ngot music for me to groove to!
W3C4_96	Hey! Everyone! On the dance\nfloor. NOW!
W3C4_191	\x0e\x03\x02\0Dance with ussss...\x0f\x03\x02
W3C4_159	Did you find all of the discs?\x0e\x01\x04\x18\x0e\0K\0e\0y\0I\0t\0e\0m\0\xff\xff\xff\xff\0\0\0\0
W3C4_160	You sure you wanna try something\nelse? He said he liked it!\x0e\x01\x04\x18\x0e\0K\0e\0y\0I\0t\0e\0m\0\xff\xff\xff\xff\0\0\0\0
W3C4_162	Yo, that's not a sound disc.
W3C4_164	All right, this one goes out to all\nthe terrifying monsters in the\nhouse. Let's get into it!
W3C4_165	\x0e\x02\0\0{s[150]}I hate it!{s[100]}\x0f\x02\0
W3C4_194	This song was overplayed the first\ntime it hit the airwaves!\x0e\0\x04\0They tried to make us love it by\nputting it on high rotation, but\nI'm not gonna fall for that. No way!\x0e\0\x04\0Loop the best five seconds, put it\nin a car commercial, and throw the\nrest in the trash. I'm done with it!
W3C4_201	What am I? A tap dancer? The\ntempo's way too fast on this track!\x0e\0\x04\0Drop the RPMs! Or better yet, drop\nthe whole album in a dumpster.\nNo, thanks!
W3C4_202	OK, OK, yeah... I can see why people\nlike this song, but it's just not for\nme, you know?
W3C4_166	He's, uh, not a fan...\x0e\0\x04\0Try one of the other discs! There\nshould be \x0e\x03\0\x04\0\0\0\0 more around this place\nsomewhere.
W3C4_208	That's what I thought.
W3C4_167	\x0e\x02\0\0{s[150]}Now that's groovy!{s[100]}\x0f\x02\0
W3C4_247	Uhhhh! That bass line is making\nmy body do things I never dreamed\npossible. I'm ready to get down!
W3C4_195	Wait, wait, wait... I'm not gonna\nbe the only one down there\ngettin' loose.\x0e\0\x04\0Why's this place so dead?\nWho killed the mood?
W3C4_248	I'm not gonna cut a rug unless\nEVERYONE is cutting a rug? Dig?!
W3C4_168	Well...at least he likes the song.\nBut we've gotta do something\nabout the dance floor!\x0e\0\x04\0Normally filling the dance floor is my\nspecialty, but this clown won't let\nme play my jams!\x0e\0\x04\0Wait! Maybe we can get those\nfaceless Toads to help. They'll\ndance to anything, right?
W3C4_203	Here, take this ancient portable\nmusic machine. \x0e\0\x04\0It's already got a disc inside, so just\nwalk around bumpin' it and I know\nthose faceless Toads will follow. We\nneed about 40, I'd say. Good luck!
W3C4_178	Forty Toads make a party, Mario.\nGood luck!
W3C4_169	Hey, you did it! You got enough\nToads to set this party OFF!\x0e\0\x04\0Let's get 'em on the dance floor\nand see what happens.
W3C4_119	{s[150]}{c[404040]}♪{c[404040]}{s[100]}
W3C4_5	Mario, we mustn't remove ancient\nartifacts like this from the site.
W3C4_66	Look at these markings...almost\nas if something was dragged\nacross the floor here.
W3C4_61	{c[e67928]}\x0e\x02\0\0To wake the moon and make a run...\x0f\x02\0\n\x0e\x02\0\0The power of ten must push as one.\x0f\x02\0 \n\x0e\x02\0\0(It's left by three above the sun.)\x0f\x02\0{c[404040]}
W3C4_62	I don't think you're strong enough\nto open it by yourself. And I haven't\nmuch to offer strength-wise either!
W3C4_63	You seem to be getting somewhere...\nBut perhaps even more pushing\npower is in order.
W3C4_186	You've done it! You're a natural-\nborn archaeologist, Mario.
W3C4_64	Shouldn't we deal with the streamer\nfirst, Mario?
W3C4_68	That's 40 of 'em!\x0e\0\x04\0I can't wait to see how this\ndance party is going to unfold...
W3C4_70	Yo, yo, yo! It's DJ Toad bringing\nyou the...uh, well not the LATEST\nhits, but...\x0e\0\x04\0It's music! Get out on the dance\nfloor with those faceless freaks\nand our special guest, Mario!
W3C4_113	Whoa...
W3C4_114	I dig it...
W3C4_116	Oh yeah...
W3C4_115	\x0e\x02\0\0{s[150]}It's groovy!{s[100]}\x0f\x02\0
W3C4_72	Hey! I know you're in the groove\nand all, but you totally blew all\nthe Toads off of the stage!\x0e\0\x04\0AND you punched out their faces\nearlier! Did you do that just so\nthey would dance with you?\nThat's monstrous!
W3C4_76	Lady, I couldn't stop groovin' now\nif I wanted to.\x0e\0\x04\0So I guess we're gonna have to...\nFACE. OFF.
W3C4_74	Oh, man... Why'd you have to\nharsh my groove? We had it\nbumpin' in here!\x0e\0\x04\0Let's keep it going anyway.\nDisco forever! Count it down!

W3C4_99	My face!
W3C4_100	Disco saves lives!
W3C4_101	Thank you!
W3C4_212	All that's left to do is get rid\nof that streamer!
W3C4_204	Yo, yo, yo! That was something\nelse, man. You brought down\nthe house!\x0e\0\x04\0But, uh...don't you have one\nmore thing to do right now?
W3C4_104	Yes! Another streamer down!\nGood job, us!\x0e\0\x04\0And you were such a big help,\nProfessor. Yay! No more yellow\nstreamer!
W3C4_93	Oh my gosh... Thank you so much\nfor getting my face back. I really\nneeded it this week!
W3C4_97	The sun is back to its usual\nsweltering self too. Thank you!
W3C4_109	After-party in Shroom City!\nWhat, what!
W3C4_110	Uhh...I forgot what I was going\nto say.\x0e\0\x04\0Oh yeah! Thank you!
W3C4_111	Yo, yo, yo! That was HOT.\x0e\0\x04\0Thanks for the help, Mario. You can\nhit me up at the hotel in town any\ntime you like. Bandages are half off\non Mummies Night!\x0e\0\x04\0Ha! Just playin'. For real though,\ncome check out my set down by\nthe pool. It's hot!
W3C4_117	...For real, though, I think you\ncould probably dig up \x0e\x03\0\x04\0\0\0\0 more of\nmy discs somewhere around here.
W3C4_118	See you at the hotel. Peace!
W3C4_106	Wow, the sun is back where\nit belongs!\x0e\0\x04\0It's so bright... Like we're in an\nactual desert!
W3C4_105	Professor? What's the matter?
W3C4_112	I've got it! The sun was the key\nall along!\x0e\0\x04\0Come! We must get to the Sun Altar\nright away!

W3G1_85	So while we've got a little time...\nTell me more about yourself, Bobby.\nWhat was life like before we met?\x0e\x01\0\x04p\x17\0\0
W3G1_41	Huh. I'm not sure where to start.\nY'know that saying, "life hits you\nhard"? Well, I got hit SUPER hard.\x0e\x01\0\x04\x88\x13\0\0
W3G1_122	Getting smacked around by life?\nOof. Sounds intense...but I think\nI know that feeling.\x0e\x01\0\x04\x94\x11\0\0
W3G1_123	Oh, right! Your brother really made\na mess of things...so I guess we're in\nthe same boat. Literally.\x0e\x01\0\x04p\x17\0\0
W3G1_124	You've got that right...but I'm gonna\nkeep doing my best! Let's get to the\nnext streamer and stop my brother!\x0e\x01\0\x04\x88\x13\0\0
W3G1_1	Here we are—Sweetpaper Valley.\x0e\0\x04\0This is the last downriver stop.\nThanks fer riding with us today,\nand enjoy yer stay!
W3G1_49	Wow! Look at these rocks!\nYou couldn't build a place like\nthis if you tried!\x0e\0\x04\0I've heard of a valley fold, but\nthis is like...an actual valley.
W3G1_50	All right! Let's hurry through\nSweetpaper Valley and find\nthat streamer!
W3G1_2	Ahoy! What'll it be?\x0e\x01\x04\x16\x0c\0W\03\0G\01\0_\03\0\x03\0\0\0\0\0\0\0
W3G1_3	Go to Shogun Studios\nGo to Autumn Mountain\nRide the Eddy River rapids\nCancel
W3G1_6	Hup!
W3G1_4	Ahoy!\n...Was there an earthquake?\nThought I heard something big.\x0e\0\x04\0Anyhow, if you're lookin' to get to\nToad Town, the warp pipe in Shogun\nStudios is way faster than paddling.\x0e\0\x04\0So what'll it be?\x0e\x01\x04\x16\x0c\0W\03\0G\01\0_\03\0\x03\0\0\0\0\0\0\0
W3G1_5	Looking to get back to Toad Town?\nTry the warp pipe in Shogun Studios.\nAnyhoo, what'll it be?\x0e\x01\x04\x16\x0c\0W\03\0G\01\0_\03\0\x03\0\0\0\0\0\0\0
W3G1_117	That streamer just keeps going...\nthrough the valley and beyond.
W3G1_119	Looks like we'll need to go through\nthat tunnel to reach the other side.
W3G1_118	Oh, hello.
W3G1_126	\x0e\x02\0\0{s[150]}Olly!{s[100]}\x0f\x02\0
W3G1_127	Yes. It's been a while, hasn't it?
W3G1_128	Ooh...you've stolen Peach's Castle,\nwrapped it in streamers, crumpled\nup countless Toads...\x0e\0\x04\0Why must you keep doing this?\nIt's so mean!
W3G1_129	Ahh, sister... You have such a flat\noutlook on life. All I am doing is\ncreating a glorious kingdom for\norigami like us.\x0e\0\x04\0How can you not grasp the\nbrilliance and daring of my plan?
W3G1_125	A world for origami...\x0e\0\x04\0But origami and flat paper can live\ntogether! You don't need to be so\nmean to these nice paper folks!\x0e\0\x04\0It's just not right. You've got to\nstop right now!
W3G1_76	Very well.\x0e\0\x04\0I thought perhaps you would listen\nto reason. I see I was mistaken.\x0e\0\x04\0Ever since you teamed up with\nthis Mario fellow, you've been\nnothing but a crinkle in my neck.
W3G1_130	\x0e\x02\0\0{s[120]}It ends now.{s[100]}\x0f\x02\0
W3G1_144	Consider this path closed.
W3G1_131	Alas, there will be an empty\norigami throne beside mine...\x0e\0\x04\0But no matter. The birth of my\nOrigami Kingdom is imminent.\nYou may as well sit back and\nwait for its arrival.
W3G1_133	Ma'am? Ma'am!\nAre you OK under there?
W3G1_138	She's OK! But it can't be good to\nflatten origami like that...\x0e\0\x04\0If we don't do something soon, she\nmight be permanently crumpled!
W3G1_139	Argh! This stupid boulder won't\nbudge! There has to be something\nwe can do!
W3G1_141	What can we do...
W3G1_140	Yes. It's the only way.\x0e\0\x04\0I know how to save Olivia, Big M.\x0e\0\x04\0We have to...
W3G1_143	SET SAIL!
W3G1_146	We have to get to the port in\nToad Town and set sail for the\nGreat Sea!
W3G1_142	I know it seems crazy to leave\nOlivia here, but...\x0e\0\x04\0I need you to trust me, Big M.
W3G1_134	Mmmph!
W3G1_135	Urghhh...
W3G1_136	...Little...help?
W3G1_86	Phew. She's still hanging on under\nthere...but we've got to hurry!\x0e\0\x04\0Let's get to Toad Town and make\nour way to the Great Sea. We can\ndo this, Big M!
W3G1_105	Big M...\x0e\0\x04\0Thanks for believing me. And taking\nme to the Great Sea.\x0e\0\x04\0Sorry I was so hush-hush about what\nhappened on that boat...and about\nthe item in that lockbox.\x0e\0\x04\0I'll tell you everything.
W3G1_94	A while back...I was traveling aboard\nthe Princess Peach with my buds.\nMy Bob-omrades. My friends.\x0e\0\x04\0We had all pitched in to share the\nVIP stateroom. Sure, some of us had\nto sleep on the floor, but...\x0e\0\x04\0The open sea... The salty breeze...\nIt was the best trip ever!
W3G1_78	But then...that monstrous Blooper\nattacked the ship.\x0e\0\x04\0We did our best to defend the\nPeach, but it was too strong.\nThat's when it happened...
W3G1_120	My fuse...got knocked loose. It flew\nright off the boat, and so did I. Next\nthing I know, I'm in the Great Sea.
W3G1_96	Not sure what happened next...\nbut I washed up at Toad Town.\nNo fuse, no memories, no clue.
W3G1_97	So off I went, lost and alone, on\na journey to try and remember...\nwell, anything.
W3G1_81	That's where you and Olivia came in.\nAnd then...those fireworks that we\nsaw together at Shogun Studios...\x0e\0\x04\0\x0e\x01\x01\0They made me remember. The fight\nwith the Blooper, my fuse, my buds...\nBoom! Everything came back to me.
W3G1_95	I'm so glad my memories are back.\nI remember everything now...\x0e\0\x04\0Including a way to rescue Olivia.
W3G1_82	See, I had a lot of buds...but I lost\nmy bestest-best bud a long time ago.\nHe got scrapped in an accident.\x0e\0\x04\0His name was...also Bob-omb. Heh.\nOlivia would have had such a hard\ntime telling us apart.\x0e\0\x04\0I always kept his fuse with me\nto remember him by...until the\namnesia hit.\x0e\0\x04\0So it just sat where I left it...\x0e\x01\x01\0\nin that VIP stateroom on the ship.
W3G1_83	Big M...\x0e\0\x04\0If I can save a friend like this, it\nmeans I've finally become the sort\nof Bob-omb I always wanted to be.\x0e\0\x04\0This is what every Bob-omb hopes\nfor—a chance to change something\nfor the better. To make an impact.\x0e\0\x04\0B-Big M... I...\x0e\0\x04\0I had so much fun traveling with\nyou and Olivia. It's been...a blast.\nHeh. Sorry. I'm kinda nervous.\x0e\0\x04\0{s[075]}Thanks for the fuse, best bud...{s[100]}\x0e\0\x04\0And thank you, Mario!\nFor everything!
W3G1_114	Mmmmfff...
W3G1_106	Wha...what happened?\nDid you save me, Mario?\nThank you so much!\x0e\0\x04\0Getting flattened hurt a LOT, but\nnow I'm back to my folded and\nfancy-free self!
W3G1_108	Wow, the whole rock is just...gone!\nBlasted into confetti!\x0e\0\x04\0How did that happen, anyway?\nDid you get some kind of dynamite\nhammer or something?\x0e\0\x04\0Just...kapow! \x0e\x01\x01\0Or what?\x0e\0\x04\0Wait...HUH?!
W3G1_109	Where's Bobby?\x0e\0\x04\0Is he around? Don't tell me he\nmissed all of this.
W3G1_110	...Uh, Mario?
W3G1_121	Wait. Did he...?\x0e\0\x04\0There was a loud bang, and\nnow the rock is gone...
W3G1_132	No. No!
W3G1_115	\x0e\x02\0\0{s[120]}It can't be!{s[100]}\x0f\x02\0
W3G1_145	Back soon.\nWait or swim. Up to you.\n\x0e\x02\x02\0-Oarsman\x0f\x02\x02
W3G2.msbt
W3G2_1	Wait, so this is the desert?\nIt's so dark and cold!\x0e\0\x04\0Where's the scorch? I thought the\nsun would be beating down on us.
W3G2_92	It is really big! Wow!\x0e\0\x04\0I guess it must be the desert after\nall, since it's just a wiiiiide open\nspace filled with sand.
W3G2_216	This darkness, though...\x0e\0\x04\0Wait, where's the sun? Do you\nthink it's hiding away because\nit's angry about something?
W3G2_93	Huh?! That can't be good.\nNo wonder it's so dark out here!\x0e\0\x04\0But wait, it's not just dark.\nIt's actually like there's a\nblack hole in the sky!
W3G2_94	What a strange place...a desert\nwith a black hole in the sky where\nthe sun should be.\x0e\0\x04\0But how could that even happen?\nHow could someone get all the way\nup there and open up a hole?
W3G2_218	Well, at least it's not scorching hot\nout here right now.\x0e\0\x04\0Should we try not to worry about\nthe black hole for now and head\nfor the streamer instead?
W3G2_198	Yeah, I was wondering about those\nspots too. They're cute! But I don't\nthink hitting them does anything.
W3G2_222	Hmm... What's this? Some kind\nof platform?\x0e\0\x04\0Is that a picture of the sun?
W3G2_52	Ah yes! Let me see here...\x0e\0\x04\0It reads, "Urghhhgag dslhafa jsxgd\nsldfasdasdg oaklsbhd."
W3G2_55	Sorry. I guess I can't actually\nread it after all.\x0e\0\x04\0I sure wish I could, though!
W3G2_12	Ah, more of that strange writing!\n...I don't suppose you want me\nto try reading it again.\x0e\0\x04\0There sure is a lot of this strange\nwriting around...
W3G2_219	Sorry, I can't read writing like that.
W3G2_73	\x0e\x02\0\0You can't read this.\x0f\x02\0
W3G2_172	Don't you think we should try\nfollowing the streamer first?
W3G2_115	Hey! It's the end of the streamer!\nWe did it!
W3G2_229	You know, it wasn't easy to\nget here.\x0e\0\x04\0Following the red streamer and\nthen the blue one... We've had some\nhard moments, and some sad ones.\x0e\0\x04\0But now, finding the yellow\nstreamer like this...it feels like\nwe finally caught a break!
W3G2_230	Wait. Where's the end? Is it\nburied in the sand?
W3G2_116	\x0e\x02\0\0{s[150]}Oh no!{s[100]}\x0f\x02\0
W3G2_117	What are we gonna do? We can't\ndig into the sand, can we?
W3G2_118	Wait, wait...there's something\nwritten on the base.\x0e\0\x04\0Maybe it's instructions for\nhow to dig down!
W3G2_119	Hmm...yes. Yes!
W3G2_231	Mario!\x0e\0\x04\0I can't read it at all. Sorry, I guess\nI got your hopes up, huh? It's\nwritten in mysterious letters that\nI can't understand!
W3G2_122	It's those mysterious letters again...\nI can't make folds or tails of this!
W3G2_120	Just when my spirits were so high...\nI don't know what to do, and the\nsun is just gone...\x0e\0\x04\0I just need a ray of light.\nONE bright ray would do\nso much for me right now...
W3G2_121	Whoa! There are at least three\nrays of light over there. Maybe\neven four!\x0e\0\x04\0Heehee, they're giving me hope\nagain. And they're so beautiful!
W3G2_138	Rays like that could only come from\na lively place filled with lots of\nhelpful people, right?\x0e\0\x04\0Maybe there's even someone there\nwho can read those mysterious\nletters for us!
W3G2_90	Whoa! This is the biggest bowl of\noatmeal I've ever seen! Somebody\nout here sure loves their breakfast.\x0e\0\x04\0Oh wait. This is sand. So what's\nthis thing for, anyway? Should\nwe try putting something there?\x0e\x01\x04\x18\x0e\0K\0e\0y\0I\0t\0e\0m\0\xff\xff\xff\xff\0\0\0\0
W3G2_89	I'm not sure that will do anything.\nAny other ideas?
W3G2_84	Ooh, it's smoking!
W3G2_258	And the smoke is so fragrant...\nIt smells like a sunny day!\x0e\0\x04\0Ahh, it's like we're just laying\nout in the sun without a care\nin the world...
W3G2_38	Oh no! It's a sandstorm!\nAre we trapped?!\x0e\0\x04\0I'm scared, Mario. What's going\nto happen next...
W3G2_102	Oh! Look at those spikes!\nBut...that's not too bad.\x0e\0\x04\0Maybe it's just a cool cactus.\nHi, cactus!
W3G2_103	Aw, who am I kidding...
W3G2_17	\x0e\x02\0\0{s[150]}This isn't good!{s[100]}\x0f\x02\0
W3G2_19	Can we move faster somehow?
W3G2_31	Noooo! The Boot Car is blowing\naway! Can we get it back?
W3G2_26	Get up! Get up! Try pressing !
W3G2_125	Try calling the Boot Car!
W3G2_126	It must have weak points!
W3G2_129	Aim for the seal! My brother's face, remember?
W3G2_131	That's not gonna work! It's too windy!
W3G2_18	Whoa! Look at that weird chunk\nof confetti.
W3G2_20	I'm saved? Oh, thank you!
W3G2_39	You were eaten by a cactus!\nWhat was it like?
W3G2_40	Well, all things considered, it\ncould have been wors— Wait!\x0e\0\x04\0Who are you? I've never seen\nanything LIKE you. Are you one\nof the Ancient Ones? Tell me!
W3G2_41	Ancient? Li'l old me? Hah!\nNo, I'm just Olivia. Nice to meet you!
W3G2_50	And what's going on with the\naltar? Who did this?
W3G2_228	Hmm...yes. It seems the ancient\nrituals were observed correctly.
W3G2_21	Whoa! You can read that writing?
W3G2_110	Well, of course! I'm a professor of\nancient studies.\x0e\0\x04\0This is written in the language of\nthe Ancient Ones. Studying it is\nmy life's work!
W3G2_24	Yes! We finally found a translator!\nNow, can you tell us what this\nall means?\x0e\0\x04\0Ooh, I'm so excited to have a\nprofessor helping us now.
W3G2_205	Oh, but before you begin... Who\nare the Ancient Ones, anyway?
W3G2_200	Well, the Ancient Ones are a people\nwho existed in this geographical\nregion a long time ago.\x0e\0\x04\0Legend has it that one of these\nAncient Ones still survives today.\nI have been seeking this person\nfor quite some time!
W3G2_215	You see, I've dedicated my career\nto learning more about the ancient\ncivilization based in this desert.\x0e\0\x04\0One day I hope to unearth a\nlegendary figure from those times.\nIn the ancient texts, he is known\nsimply as...Khap'taan Teeowed.
W3G2_233	Khap'taan von whosit? What\na funny name!
W3G2_234	What?! You think the Khap'taan\nperson has something to do with\nsomething called a sea chart?
W3G2_235	Khap'taan von whosit?\x0e\0\x04\0That name sounds oddly familiar,\nbut very confusing...
W3G2_236	Wait! It's the Khap'taan Teeowed\nperson, right?\x0e\0\x04\0You know, the person with the\nsea chart for the Great Sea!
W3G2_238	Professor, I think we should\nmeet that Khap'taan Teeowed\nperson too!\x0e\0\x04\0Ooh, but we need to do something\nabout the streamer in the desert\nbefore that.\x0e\0\x04\0Wait...can you come with us to\nhelp translate the mysterious\nwriting? That might help a lot!
W3G2_113	Khap'taan Teeowed? Am I saying\nit right? Is it Khap'TAAN TeeOWED\nor KHAP'taan TEEowed?\x0e\0\x04\0Your research sounds very\ncomplicated, Professor.\x0e\0\x04\0But we've got a complicated\nproblem too. That streamer in\nthe desert!\x0e\0\x04\0Wait...can you come with us to\nhelp translate the mysterious\nwriting? That might help a lot!
W3G2_204	Well, according to my research,\nthere may be extensive evidence\nabout Khap'taan Teeowed hidden\nin the desert...
W3G2_217	As a matter of fact, I was\nconducting research on this\nvery altar when I was consumed.\x0e\0\x04\0There is a nonzero chance that\nI may be, er, consumed again if I\ncontinue alone, and not just by\nmy research.
W3G2_220	Ah, but with Mario by my side,\nmy survival might be more assured...
W3G2_223	Oh, I digress and blather!\nI accept your offer.\x0e\0\x04\0Perhaps together we shall yet\nsolve the mystery of the...er...\nmysterious Khap'taan Teeowed!
W3G2_201	Great! Ooh, this is exciting, getting\nto work with an actual professor!
W3G2_202	Yes, yes, well...don't get too excited.\nMuch of our time is merely spent\nuncovering incredible ancient relics\nand being chased by adversaries.\x0e\0\x04\0Now, I noticed some ancient writing\non the second floor of my hotel that\nmight help us. They may hide a clue\nabout your streamer as well!
W3G2_237	Wow, you're already helping\nso much!\x0e\0\x04\0Maybe you can even re-explain all\nthat complicated stuff you just said\nalong the way! I kinda spaced out.
W3G2_85	{c[e67928]}\x0e\x02\0\0To open up a secret door,\x0f\x02\0\n\x0e\x02\0\0offer the sun a scent adored...\x0f\x02\0{c[404040]}
W3G2_257	I believe you have done everything\ncorrectly here with the Sun Incense,\nbut something is still missing...
W3G2_211	Hello! What's that over there?
W3G2_209	Mario, take a look over there.\nThe ground is quite literally shining!\x0e\0\x04\0That's what we in academia call a\n"giant clue." Perhaps something is \nburied there!
W3G2_259	Now, with your help, I should\nbe able to excavate the site using\na shovel.\x0e\0\x04\0Just stand where you'd like me\nto begin, and press .
W3G2_210	Erm... Would you mind moving to\nthe shining spot and pressing ?\nThis is Ancient Studies 101, Mario!
W3G2_274	I'm happy to dig away anywhere if\nyou think you've got a lead, but the\nshining spot is quite interesting...
W3G2_275	Oh ho! Good luck with that. Try !
W3G2_112	Aha! You see what I mean? We've\nstruck treasure.\x0e\0\x04\0I can dig in any soft ground—like\nsand or dirt—even if it's not shining.\nPress  and I will hop to it!\x0e\0\x04\0Do be on the lookout for suspicious\nplaces to dig, hm?
W3G2_203	Ah, Professor! This is where the\nyellow streamer seems to end.\x0e\0\x04\0We know it goes deeper, but we\ncan't dig down to reach the spool\nand disconnect it!
W3G2_63	Very well! Allow me to translate\nthe ancient inscription...
W3G2_64	{c[e67928]}\x0e\x02\0\0When darkness looms,\x0f\x02\0\n\x0e\x02\0\0the desert sand entombs\x0f\x02\0\n\x0e\x02\0\0the Temple of Shrooms...\x0f\x02\0{c[404040]}
W3G2_133	Oh no! It doesn't say anything\nabout how to get into the sand.
W3G2_134	My goodness...it must be a reference\nto the Temple of Shrooms!\x0e\0\x04\0Hmm. No one has yet been able to\nlocate it, despite our best efforts\nwith these tiny shovels.\x0e\0\x04\0Could it be that the ancient temple\nis buried here, slumbering beneath\nthe sand?
W3G2_265	My goodness...it must be a reference\nto the Temple of Shrooms!\x0e\0\x04\0Could it be that the ancient temple\nis buried here, slumbering beneath\nthe sand?
W3G2_136	Whoa...that would be amazing!\x0e\0\x04\0I'm imagining falling asleep under\nthe sand without a bed or blankets\nor anything like that...\x0e\0\x04\0Maybe when we wake up the temple\nto get to the streamer, we can ask\nhow it did that!
W3G2_266	I'm afraid there's nothing we\ncan do without further research.\x0e\0\x04\0Might I suggest we return to the\nhotel and study the murals?
W3G2_264	It was worth a try, I suppose.
W3G2_65	{c[e67928]}\x0e\x02\0\0To find my eye would be a feat...\x0f\x02\0\n\x0e\x02\0\0Unless you look around my feet.\x0f\x02\0{c[404040]}
W3G2_66	{c[e67928]}\x0e\x02\0\0Near walls of waves, a fire's place...\x0f\x02\0\n\x0e\x02\0\0An eye is there, by earth encased!\x0f\x02\0{c[404040]}
W3G2_67	{c[e67928]}\x0e\x02\0\0Beneath the feet of twins entwined\x0f\x02\0\n\x0e\x02\0\0in needles, there, the eye you'll find!\x0f\x02\0{c[404040]}
W3G2_68	{c[e67928]}\x0e\x02\0\0Eclipse the sun above the lake...\x0f\x02\0\n\x0e\x02\0\0A buried eye is yours to take!\x0f\x02\0{c[404040]}
W3G2_69	Well, this is certainly a valuable\nclue. A bit more obscure than I'd\nlike, but important to be sure!\x0e\0\x04\0I'll file the translation away in my\nnotes. You can check them anytime\nby pressing .
W3G2_70	I've added the translation to my\nnotes. You can press  to read\nit anytime.
W3G2_101	Would you like to review my\nnotes on the ancient texts?\x0e\x01\x04\x14\n\0y\0e\0s\0n\0o\0\x01\0\0\0\0\0\0\0
W3G2_91	Would you like to review my\nnotes on the ancient texts?\x0e\x01\x04\x1a\x10\0W\03\0G\02\0_\01\00\07\0\x02\0\0\0\0\0\0\0
W3G2_107	Hotel mural\nAncient slabs (Towers)\nCancel
W3G3_212	Hmm, what's this? It looks like\nthere's a way inside. Should we\ntry it out?
W3G3_322	Whoa! Look at this huge lanky guy!\x0e\0\x04\0And the top almost looks like\nsomeone we know, doesn't it?\nHee hee...
W3G3_326	Ooh, another one of those\nlanky guys!
W3G3_328	Wow! Still another one! Is this\none the tallest yet?
W3G3_329	Eeee! I love finding these tall\nlanky guys!
W3G3_323	Whew! That's a lot of stairs.\nFor you, I mean! Thanks for\ncarrying me so often.\x0e\0\x04\0Do you think we're in this lanky\ntower's head yet?
W3G2_10	Ooh, is that a new type of\nMagic Circle?\x0e\0\x04\0I don't think I've seen one like\nthis before. What could it be\nused for?
W3G2_35	I can't do anything with this\nyet, Mario.
W3G2_135	Here I go! Do you want to skip the\nwhole performance this time?\x0e\x01\x04\x14\n\0y\0e\0s\0n\0o\0\x01\0\0\0\0\0\0\0
W3G2_127	Hmm...this big jar is filled with\nwater or something, isn't it?\x0e\0\x04\0But it's all dark and ooky. I don't\nthink it's water, so I wouldn't\ndrink it, Mario!
W3G2_273	Wheeeeew! It smells bad too!\x0e\0\x04\0Please consider this a second \nwarning against drinking the water!
W3G2_128	Ughhh...it still smells like the worst\nthing I've ever smelled combined\nwith the second-worst thing I've\never smelled.\x0e\0\x04\0Please stop making me smell it!
W3G2_33	Hey, it's a cute little window where\nyou can see outside or place a little\nknickknack!\x0e\0\x04\0Should we try putting something\nthere to see how it looks?
W3G2_32	Hmm, I don't think that will fit.
W3G2_34	That's about the right size, but\nthe shape doesn't seem right.
W3G2_36	Ooh, it fits perfectly. How cute!
W3G2_54	It really looks like it was meant to\ngo there. Such a pretty eye!
W3G2_58	I wonder how it would shine if a\nbright light hit it...
W3G2_98	Whoa! It's spinning! Could it be the\nFire Vellumental's Magic Circle?
W3G2_82	Olivia! You burned up! Amazing!\nThey didn't teach this in school.\nAnd I minored in regenerative\nimmolation!
W3G2_111	Wow, I really lit up this space!
W3G2_37	Oh my gosh! I set all of that black\nwater on fire!\x0e\0\x04\0NOW it's bright in here. Wow, good\nlighting sure makes a difference.
W3G2_114	...Was something else supposed\nto happen, other than the lighting\nbeing improved?
W3G2_221	Ooh, the stone you put in there\nis sparkling so brightly.\x0e\0\x04\0What's happening? Other than\nthis pretty light show?!
W3G2_29	Ack! What was all of that shaking?\nWhy did we all fall down? What\njust happened?
W3G2_254	Heehee! I knew what was going\nto happen this time, so I didn't\nfall down.
W3G2_268	Professor! Are you OK?
W3G2_255	Oh...oh, yes. Sorry about that.\nI suppose I'm not as swashbuckling\nas some of my colleagues...
W3G2_256	Wait...I don't need to fall down,\ndo I? I'm floating!
W3G2_76	Look at that lanky guy... Isn't he\nfacing a different direction now?\x0e\0\x04\0Maybe he just wanted to look\nat something different...
W3G2_88	Oh, this one changed direction too!
W3G2_97	Now this tower is facing in a new\ndirection too. They must all do\nthat, huh?
W3G2_79	Yep! This one turned also!
W3G2_206	Whoa, you dug up some kind of\nstrange rock. What is it?
W3G2_207	Hmm, it's quite old. It might be\nancient treasure...or a simple\nancient rock. Either way, I advise\nthat you hang on to it.
W3G3_324	Hmm...this seems so familiar.\nI'm quite certain we've seen this\nconfiguration of statues before.\x0e\0\x04\0But there's still something missing...
W3G2_132	Is that a stand...\x0e\0\x04\0It's...it's calling to me!

W3G2_61	Does this mean the ceremony\nworked?

Let us go inside and\nprepare to meet a god!
W3G2_72	Oh, I'm so embarrassed.\x0e\0\x04\0Was I really singing loudly enough\nto wake the ancient temple?!
W3G2_109	Well, this looks different! Did\nsomething light up? Was this\nhere before?
W3G2_81	It looks like the light has illuminated\npart of a design! But what is it?
W3G2_83	Whoa! Could it be the Earth\nVellumental's Magic Circle?
W3G2_99	Just as I suspected!
W3G2_78	Look at this, you two. The altar\nhas opened up to reveal some kind\nof entrance!\x0e\0\x04\0This may contain what I have\nbeen seeking...proof of the\nAncient Ones themselves!
W3G2_75	Yes...it all makes sense now.\nYou performed the ceremony with\nthe Sun Incense...\x0e\0\x04\0But the sun itself was missing!\nNow that it has returned, the\npath inside has revealed itself.\x0e\0\x04\0Oh ho! Wait until they hear about\nthis back at the university! I expect\nregistration for my spring semester\ncourses will be at an all-time high...
W3G2_77	I'm not sure what the professor is\ntalking about, but I'm sure glad\nhe's so happy!
W3G2_105	Oh, well, it's all thanks to you\ntwo, of course.\x0e\0\x04\0This may have remained sealed\nforever if you hadn't been able\nto return the sun to the sky.
W3G2_106	Now then, let's hurry inside!\x0e\0\x04\0I'm certain we'll find even more\nto celebrate. Perhaps even a solid\nlead on the legendary Khap'taan\nTeeowed himself!
W3G2_240	Mario, we're on the brink of a\ntenure-making discovery. We\ncan't leave now!
W3G2_261	Hey, guys... Is it absolutely freezing\nin here, or is it just me?\x0e\0\x04\0I thought we restored the sun...\nWhy is it so chilly in here?
W3G2_262	Ah! I can explain. Although we are in\nthe desert, we have now descended\nbelow its surface, where the sun's\nwarming rays cannot reach us.\x0e\0\x04\0Actually...the mere lack of sunlight\ncannot explain THIS degree of chill.\nI retract my explanation.
W3G2_169	My word! What in the name of\npeer-reviewed study is THAT?
W3G2_241	It's ice! A huge chunk!\x0e\0\x04\0That's why it's so cold, Professor.\nI get it now.
W3G2_267	Look at this... The refrigeration\ntechnology on display is more\nsophisticated than I could have\never imagined!
W3G2_242	Mother of graduate students!\nThere's someone in there!\x0e\0\x04\0Hmm...judging by the distinctive\nred spots and that unmistakable\ncloak... Could it be?!
W3G2_95	It's Khap'taan Teeowed himself!\nHe's really real!\x0e\0\x04\0This is no mere clue—it's the real\ndeal. I must excavate the site and\nsave him immediately!
W3G2_199	Mario! Can you help save\nKhap'taan Teeowed?
W3G2_224	I will free Khap'taan Teeowed...even\nif it takes me a thousand years with\nthis shovel!
W3G2_155	He's not moving! Oh, I hope he\ncan be revived...
W3G2_243	Maybe he's just stiff from being\nfrozen for so long. Poor guy...\x0e\0\x04\0Should I try heating him up with\nfire again?
W3G2_86	\x0e\x03\x01\x04\xcd\xccL>That won't...be necessary.\x0f\x03\x01\x0e\0\x04\0\x0e\x03\x01\x04\xcd\xccL>Burn not paper with fire, lest ye\nyourself become singed.\x0f\x03\x01

W3G2_152	"Captain T. Ode"?! Of course!\nMario...Olivia...I think he means\nKhap'taan Teeowed!\x0e\0\x04\0At last! I can finally say I've met\na real Ancient One myself.
W3G2_246	Now then! Down to serious\nacademic business!\x0e\0\x04\0There is a simple question that\nhas plagued researchers and\narchaeologists for time immemorial.\x0e\0\x04\0Now, in this historic moment, I have\nthe opportunity to go directly to\nthe source. What an occasion!
W3G2_153	Oh Khap'taan, my Khap'taan!\nWe have studied the diet of the\nancients based on artifacts and\noral traditions in the region.\x0e\0\x04\0But there's one thing that has\nus completely stumped...\x0e\0\x04\0How did you take your coffee?
W3G2_247	\x0e\x03\x01\x04\xcd\xccL>Cream and three sugars.\x0f\x03\x01
W3G2_96	Three sugars?! It's beyond my\nwildest imagination.\x0e\0\x04\0What a breakthrough! You Ancient\nOnes have probably forgotten more\nabout coffee than we will ever know!
W3G2_248	My work here is done.
W3G2_249	Wow... Coffee with three sugars.\nYou must really like sugar!\nHow interesting!\x0e\0\x04\0Oh...I guess it's not that interesting.
W3G2_250	Oh! But I do want to ask you about\nsomething called a sea chart!\x0e\0\x04\0We need to get across the Great\nSea to reach one of the streamers\nthat's— Oh, it's a long story. Mainly\nwe just need the sea chart!
W3G2_157	\x0e\x03\x01\x04\xcd\xccL>Ah, the sea chart. And the\nGreat Sea herself... Yes, everything\nis coming back to me...\x0f\x03\x01\x0e\0\x04\0\x0e\x03\x01\x04\xcd\xccL>In this moment...I am as a bird\nin a cage.\x0f\x03\x01\x0e\0\x04\0\x0e\x03\x01\x04\xcd\xccL>I yearn to sail free at the helm of\nmy Marino, underneath the great\ncresting waves.\x0f\x03\x01\x0e\0\x04\0\x0e\x03\x01\x04\xcd\xccL>I shall require the sea chart,\nas well as my noble vessel.\nMake it so!\x0f\x03\x01
W3G2_160	Anyway...why do you seem so sad,\nMr. Captain? Is it because you were\nfrozen? Or did something else\nhappen to you?
W3G2_154	\x0e\x03\x01\x04\xcd\xccL>In this moment...I am as a bird in\na cage.\x0f\x03\x01\x0e\0\x04\0\x0e\x03\x01\x04\xcd\xccL>I yearn to sail free at the helm of\nmy Marino, underneath the great\ncresting waves.\x0f\x03\x01
W3G2_251	Did you say Marino? Do you know\nabout the Super Marino?!\x0e\0\x04\0That's so weird! How did you get\nto the mus\xe9e already?!
W3G2_252	Marino... It's a strange word, but\nI feel like I've heard it before...\x0e\0\x04\0Oh! Was the Toad at the mus\xe9e\ntalking about it?
W3G2_158	\x0e\x03\x01\x04\xcd\xccL>So my Marino rests in a "mus\xe9e,"\nas you call it? It is no place for\nher adventurous spirit. She yearns\nto break free!\x0f\x03\x01\x0e\0\x04\0\x0e\x03\x01\x04\xcd\xccL>You have my thanks, strange one.\nI know what I must do.\x0f\x03\x01
W3G2_276	Oh. OK. So...do we think he's going\nto give us the See Chart, or...\x0e\0\x04\0It was hard for me to understand\nanything he was saying. I guess\nthat's ancient language for you!
W3G2_277	Oh. OK. I wonder if he's headed to\nthe mus\xe9e. He sure seems to care\nabout the Marino...\x0e\0\x04\0It was hard for me to understand\nanything he was saying. I guess\nthat's ancient language for you!
W3G2_156	Ahem! Sorry to interrupt, but\nI haven't made an archaeological\ndiscovery in over five minutes.\x0e\0\x04\0...I'm just kidding. A little academic\nhumor, oh ho! Thank you both for\nall of your help. You've made my\ndream come true.
W3G2_159	No, we should be thanking YOU!\nYou were such a big help in the\ndesert, Professor.\x0e\0\x04\0So...thank you!
W3G2_165	Now then, should we head for the\npurple streamer in the Great Sea?\x0e\0\x04\0Maybe we should go to the mus\xe9e\nfirst and see if that's where\nCaptain T. Ode went.
W3G2_260	Now then, should we head for the\npurple streamer in the Great Sea?
W3G2_245	Now then, should we head out and\ntry to find the next streamer?
W3G2_253	What's all this about the purple\nstreamer in the Great Sea?\x0e\0\x04\0What's the Great Sea? Where is it?\nMaybe someone back in Toad Town\nwill know. Should we go there?
W3G2_214	Help me!
W3G2_239	Eeeeee!
W3G2_263	I'm scared!
W3G2_289	Go away!
W3G2_280	Wouldn't driving be fun?
W3G2_281	Aren't you tired of walking?
W3G2_282	You're going to walk?
W3G2_288	Do you want to call the Boot Car?
W3G2_179	There's so much sand in my shoes...
W3G2_180	Walking on sand uses different muscles...ugh!
W3G2_181	Are we to walk the entire way?
W3G2_182	Should we call your vehicle?
W3G2_183	Hup!
W3G2_184	Heave-ho!
W3G2_185	Up with you!
W3G2_187	There we are!
W3G2_188	Professor, how was it inside the cactus?
W3G2_189	It was dark and scary but educational.
W3G2_225	Hey, Professor! Will you sing for us?
W3G2_226	Goodness, no! How about a lecture?
W3G2_232	Hey, Professor! You studying quietly or quietly studying?
W3G2_270	Oh ho! Good one, Olivia.
W3G2_271	The fuel efficiency on this vehicle is remarkable!
W3G2_272	Leave the ancient texts to me!
W3G2_285	Dare I dream to meet a real Ancient One?

W3G3_318	Ah, you're back. Shall we?
W3G2_45	Ah, thank you. And welcome to the\nScorching Sandpaper Desert,\nwhere it's always scorching hot!\x0e\0\x04\0...Except right now, I guess.\nC'mon, desert! Scorch! You're\nmaking me look bad!
W3G2_47	That's more like it, eh? How you\nlike it now? Too scorching for ya?\nHa ha!
W3G2_4	Word is you've got yourself a pretty\nsweet Boot Car... Does it go fast\nwhen you press ?\x0e\0\x04\0Never mind. Don't answer or even\noffer me a ride. I'll just sprint back\nto Toad Town. Yeesh...
W3G2_6	You ever take a close look at the\ntop of the tower? It looks familiar,\nright? Like a weird-looking face?\x0e\0\x04\0On second thought, it's actually\nkind of handsome...
W3G2_48	Thank you! As a show of gratitude,\nI'll point you to that significant-\nlooking altar just over there.
W3G2_49	Thank you! I was starting to think\nI'd rather have just been folded up...
W3G2_51	Thank you. And don't worry—I'm\nnot poisonous. I'm venomous!
W3G2_53	Don't be annoyed with me...\nI was using my lizard brain!
W3G2_42	Oh, thank you! My life's dream was\nto live as a beetle on a cactus, but\nit turned out to not be that great.
W3G2_43	Hello! By unfolding me, you've\nsubscribed to a service that I\nlike to call "Ask a Cactus"!\x0e\0\x04\0Did you know that you can leave a\nBoot Car anywhere, and it will come\nback when you use the whistle?\x0e\0\x04\0Sorry. I was a cactus for a long time.\nI kept my brain active by coming up\nwith this idea. Thank you!
W3G2_7	How could you tell that was me?!\nArgh! I've got to work on my cactus\nimpression.
W3G2_8	Ahh, thanks for that. This is\nScorching Sandpaper West, by\nthe way.\x0e\0\x04\0Proud home to one of the region's\nfour mysterious towers!
W3G2_193	Did you know that we all have\nskeletons INSIDE our bodies?
W3G2_194	Morbid stuff, huh?
W3G2_195	Free at last!
W3G2_196	I need closure.
W3G2_46	This is Scorching Sandpaper \nEast, right?\x0e\0\x04\0I was supposed to be touring some\nstylish ancient walls around here.\nBut now I can't find them!
W3G2_190	Mario! Charmed, I'm sure.
W3G2_191	I kind of liked being a snake!\nEspecially around here. Sand,\nsnakes, and ruined temples—classic!
W3G2_192	Oh! It's you! I thought maybe you\nwere the snake catcher.\n...Are snake catchers a thing?
W3G2_212	Sorry for hiding like that. I'm just \na bit shy. Also, your boots look\nREALLY scary to a snake.
W3G2_213	Whew, thanks for that. Am I still in\nScorching Sandpaper Far West?\nI am, right?\x0e\0\x04\0I heard there were some neat ruins\nto check out here too. It's just that\nthe big towers are so popular... I like\nto take the road less traveled!
W3G2_44	Ahh, thanks! Hey, what do you\nthink they built those huge towers\nfor, anyway?\x0e\0\x04\0Like, were they just meant to be\na cool background for selfies, or...
W3G2_197	Thaaaaaat's right!

W3G3_47	I can assure you that we spare\nno expense to provide the ultimate\nin luxury and hospitality.
W3G3_48	You'll find no finer accommodations\nin all of Snif City. I can guarantee\nyou that!

W3G3_50	When they shine all four lights\non the front of the building, it's\nreally something...
W3G3_49	Hey! Word to the wise. I don't trust\nthe Snifit who's setting up that\ntent with the lamp on top...
W3G3_46	Some say this place used to be\nknown as Shroom City.\x0e\0\x04\0All I know is that it was completely\nvacant when us Snifits moved in.\nFinders keepers, right?
W3G3_193	Isn't this a tranquil pond? It's so\nsmooth and calm... It's almost like\na mirror.
W3G3_56	Brooooo... I'm vibing so hard with\nthis music. It's like I'm totally\noblivious to everything else...
W3G3_86	He's in my seat! And YES I'm aware\nthat there is another seat open!
W3G3_57	Do you think the lamp-shaped\nstall behind the hotel is fishy?\nWhy is it taking so long to set up?
W3G3_332	Hey! That lamp store I was talking\nabout is open now! Thought you\nmight want to know.
W3G3_58	What's up? You got a request?\x0e\0\x04\0Oh, I forgot. I don't take requests.\nScram!
W3G3_197	Can you believe that guy?\nSurfin' in the fountain? Where'd\nthat board even come from?
W3G3_338	There's another Snifit around here\nwho likes to steal vacant seats.\nSo water or not, I ain't movin'.
W3G3_85	I'm incapable of embarrassment!
W3G3_82	Hey, I found something you might\nbe interested in among all this mess.\nIt's at the front desk.
W3G3_88	Feels like I'm never gonna get this\nplace clean. I just wanna party at\nthe pool like everyone else...
W3G3_54	Aww, man! What happened to\nmy wave?\x0e\0\x04\0Ehh, fountain surfing was played\nout anyway. I'm gonna go back to\nmy room and invent tub surfing.
W3G3_51	Surfing isn't as fun when you're\nthe board.\x0e\0\x04\0Well, that's all behind me. I'm free!\nFree to pursue a life where no one\ncan take advantage of me again.\x0e\0\x04\0I was actually here for a conference\non investing! Something about the\npyramids in the area...\x0e\0\x04\0\x0e\x01\x01\0Ah, but you don't want to hear\nabout that scheme. Here, take this.\nJust a small token of my gratitude.
W3G3_115	Looking for a room? Go check in\nat the front desk. I'm just the\ndesignated lobby pacer.
W3G3_61	Welcome, welcome! It's always such\na pleasure to encounter travelers\nlike yourselves.\x0e\0\x04\0Unfortunately, we are fully booked\nat the moment. I've heard that\nsleeping in the desert is an option.
W3G3_62	Oh! We're not looking for a room...\nWe're looking for a person who can\nread the mysterious letters.\x0e\0\x04\0Is there anyone like that\nstaying here?
W3G3_63	Oh, Professor Toad! You're working\nwith him? Well, he's out right now,\nunfortunately.\x0e\0\x04\0I suppose I can give you the key\nto his room if you're working\ntogether. Have a good day!
W3G3_132	Mario...I think the clerk thinks\nwe're working with some kind of\nprofessor Toad!\x0e\0\x04\0How lucky are we? This might be\nour chance to meet someone who\ncan read the mysterious letters!
W3G3_140	Up the stairs at the end of the\nsecond floor hallway. Can't miss it!\x0e\0\x04\0I hope you guys can keep each\nother busy talking about...what\nwas it? Archery arts? For hours\nand hours.
W3G3_65	Heehee! I can't wait to meet this\nmysterious professor...
W3G3_136	Hey, look at this!\x0e\0\x04\0There's a huge picture all along\nthe wall. Incredible!\x0e\0\x04\0What is it, though? It's almost like\na comic book. Would we call it a\ncomic wall?
W3G3_137	Oh, and there's some more of\nthat mysterious lettering too.
W3G3_147	I sure hope the Toad we're looking\nfor can help us read this language.\nIt seems like it's everywhere!
W3G3_160	I sure hope we can find someone\nto help us translate this stuff.\nIt seems like it's everywhere!
W3G3_69	The key isn't working!\nWhat's going on?
W3G3_106	Ah, pardon me! You two!
W3G3_71	I completely forgot earlier.\nWe down—er, UPgraded your\nfriend to a different room.\x0e\0\x04\0He's on the first floor in one of\nour Basique™ rooms. Sorry for\nthe mix-up.
W3G3_83	Just follow me. I'll show you.
W3G3_92	Ooh...I hate to complain, but a\nmix-up like that is NOT a good sign.
W3G3_129	And here we are. Through this\ndoorway then first door on your left.\nMy apologies.
W3G3_110	Yay! That did the trick.\x0e\0\x04\0Should we head inside and see\nif this is the professor's room?
W3G14	Oh, it is pretty nice. I want room\nservice! It's my first time in a hotel!
W3G15	And look at this bed. It's classy\nyet cozy! I could just lie there\nand unfold...
W3G3_107	Ah, but I suppose we don't really\nhave time to relax.
W3G3_111	So is there anything around\nhere that could help us find\nthat professor, Mario?
W3G3_101	Archaeology Log, Day XX\nAt long last, a clue! This may unlock\nthe secrets of the Ancient Ones...\x0e\0\x04\0I have recently discovered an\nancient treasure. An item that\ncould prove key in my research.\x0e\0\x04\0I've loosely translated its name as \n"Sun Incense," and it appears to play\na role in certain ancient ceremonies.\x0e\0\x04\0Archaeology Log, Day XX\nI have obtained the Sun Incense\nfrom the Snifit for a "fair price."\nMy preparations are complete!\nI now make for the Sun Altar.

W3G3_138	What did you learn, Mario?\nIs that his journal? I can't\nread his handwriting, so you'll\nhave to help me...\x0e\0\x04\0Does it say anything about where\nhe went or if he took anything\nwith him?
W3G3_139	Those are my notes! I must ask that\nyou wait to read them along with\neveryone else...when they're\npublished in an academic journal.
W3G3_146	So we're going to be roommates, eh?\nWell, I'm a bit of a "loud studier."\nI hope you don't mind.
W3G3_135	Thanks for your help, front desk\nSnifit! The room is posh but tasteful.\nI may have rolled around on the bed\na little bit.
W3G3_141	Sorry, I got confused. Is our\nroom on the first floor or the\nsecond floor?
W3G3_142	Don't worry. Happens all the time.
W3G3_143	Ah, my mistake. We did make some\nminor adjustments to our room\nassignments recently.\x0e\0\x04\0You'll find our finest suite and the\npride and joy of the Snif City Royal\nHotel—our ancient mural—on the\nsecond floor.\x0e\0\x04\0On the main floor, you'll find...your\ncolleague's room. I assure you it has\nthe requisite number of walls.
W3G3_134	Oh, that reminds me. Your colleague\nwas asking after a particular trinket\nwe had on display.\x0e\0\x04\0I didn't want to sell it to him, but\nhe simply insisted. So I may have\ncharged a bit more than it's worth.\x0e\0\x04\0I've been feeling bad about that,\nso why don't you take another\none for free?
W3G3_148	Ah, I feel better. Thank you for that.\nNow, if you're still looking to meet\nup with your friend...he went off\nhappily somewhere, I'm afraid.\x0e\0\x04\0We don't offer concierge services,\nbut you may want to check in with\nthe desert-help-kiosk attendant in\ntown so you don't get lost.
W3G3_130	I'm sorry—I am contractually\nrestricted from concierge work.\nPlease check the desert help\nkiosk in town.
W3G3_168	Oh, you're finally reunited. Splendid!\nMight I suggest a viewing of our\nsecond-story mural?\x0e\0\x04\0Many visitors claim it's the highlight\nof the hallway!
W3G3_184	This violates my "no concierge work"\ncontract, but I'll tell you that our\ngreen guest said that he was going\nto visit the merchants in town.
W3G3_185	So you know that green guy?\nYou know a lot of people. Are you\na celebrity? You're legally required\nto tell me if you are!
W3G3_75	This place has been skating by on\nthe strength of its ancient murals\nfor a looooong time if you ask me.\x0e\0\x04\0All right, all right. I guess the pool\nis pretty nice too.

W3G3_313	Ahh! This most definitely refers\nto the Temple of Shrooms, which we\nnow know to be real.
W3G3_314	Are those four things surrounding it\neyeballs? They kind of give me the\ncreeps. Like they're following me!

W3G3_309	Ah! It appears to depict some kind\nof ancient ritual.\x0e\0\x04\0The body movements are quite\ndistinct indeed!
W3G3_155	It is also oddly specific about\nwho must perform the ritual's\nspecial incantation.\x0e\0\x04\0Yes...the text suggests that it\nmust be performed by someone with\na "melodic voice" and "mega pipes."\x0e\0\x04\0Don't shoot the translator, but\nthat sounds like it could be you,\nOlivia!
W3G3_264	WHAT?! Me? No way.\nA melodic voice? Mega pipes? Me?!\x0e\0\x04\0I mean, I suppose my pipes are\nKINDA mega...and I can carry a\ntune...

W3G3_104	Whew... I knew my minor in ancient\ndance would pay off one day.
W3G3_108	You did splendidly, Olivia. I believe\nyou're ready to perform the full\nritual. Give it all you've got!
W3G3_74	All right. I'll do my best!
W3G3_24	It's all quite mysterious, but it\nsuggests that we offer up some\nsort of ritual incantation...
W3G3_25	Fire is burning in my chest...\nIt is aflame... I call your name...\nIn retrospect, the ancient texts\nwere quite clear and informative.

W3G3_64	Oh, thanks for that. No one buys\nsound discs anymore, so I thought\nI'd be there forever.\x0e\0\x04\0I'm surprised this store still exists,\nto be honest. The owner isn't even\nhere half the time!

W3G3_241	Looking for Scorching Sandpaper\nFar East? It's, uh...farther east.
W3G3_242	You'll have to use the boots on\nyour feet to get around this\ntown, Mario. No vehicles allowed!
W3G3_327	Welcome to Shroom City,\npreviously known as Snif City,\npreviously known as Shroom City!
W3G3_236	These Toads aren't so bad, I guess.\nThey've accepted our Snifitly ways.
W3G3_246	Yeah, the Snifits came in and pretty\nmuch took over. But to be honest,\nwe weren't really doing much with\nthe place anyway.
W3G3_255	Oof...I moved here for the climate\nback when the sun was gone.
W3G3_263	The sun is out and all of the Toads\nare back in Shroom City! Plus, like,\na hundred Snifits, I guess.
W3G3_253	This guy was just here when I got\nback, so...we live together now.
W3G3_252	I can hear your voice on my side\nof the room again!
W3G3_250	Zzzzz... *HORK*\x0e\0\x04\0{s[075]}Wheeew...{s[100]}
W3G3_251	The snoring is actually a huge\nupgrade from my last roommate...
W3G3_247	Apparently Snifits call seesawing\nsawseeing. But it sounds like it's\nbasically the same thing!
W3G3_230	Sawseeing is fun!
W3G3_214	Seesawing is fun!
W3G3_270	I heard that smart-guy Toad with\nthe fancy hat is staying at the\nhotel here.
W3G3_269	That Toad with the weird hat is\nsupposedly some big-shot professor.\nI don't really see it.
W3G3_281	Who coulda known that this entire\ntown and luxury hotel was occupied\nbefore we got here?\x0e\0\x04\0Ah, but now that the Toads are\nback, we're OK with sharing the\nspace with them.
W3G3_282	Welcome, Mario!
W3G3_294	Ah, Mario! Welcome to the Royal\nuh...Sniff-Shroom Hotel? No, no,\nthat's not it.\x0e\0\x04\0We're still working on the name\nnow that we're sharing...
W3G3_283	It was my idea to keep the lights\non during the daytime. It's totally\nworth it, right?
W3G3_284	Wait, are you telling me that that\nstall with the giant lamp on top\ndidn't even sell lamps?!
W3G3_219	You might have already figured this\nout, but you can just walk right\nthrough that tent...
W3G3_285	Well, Shroom City is really bustling\nnow! Wait, sorry...Snif City. Wait...\nI've got it! Shnroomf City!
W3G3_286	I heard that a bunch of Toads went\nto a dance party in a crypt and had\ntheir faces punched out.\x0e\0\x04\0How come I didn't get invited?
W3G3_287	It's good to be back. And to have\nmy face back. Wow, is it weird that\nI said the face part second?
W3G3_293	There's something funny about the\ngrass around here, but I'm too\nsleepy to investigate...
W3G3_288	Not that I have to explain myself,\nbut I'm taking a nap in the shade\nbecause it's hot out!
W3G3_248	Can you believe this merchant stall\nwas vacant? And filled with some\nreally weird old lamps!\x0e\0\x04\0I figured I'd take over the business.\nAnd I owe it all to you for saving me\nback in the ruins. Here, take this!
W3G3_249	Welp, it was good while it lasted.\nBut now I'm out of lamps, so I guess\nI'll shut it down.
W3G3_295	Oh, um... I guess it's fine that\nyou're inside the shop. You are\nMario, after all.
W3G3_272	You feelin' it, Mario? Woo woo!
W3G3_257	I've been waiting for someone to\nshare this lounger with me.
W3G3_260	This guy! My new lounge-chair\nbuddy is such a character.
W3G3_268	...Do you think there's room\nfor three?
W3G3_261	It's great to be back home.\n...Yes, I live in this hotel. What of it?
W3G3_262	The rhythm got me.
W3G3_265	Don't worry—I'm laminated.
W3G3_256	He said I could do my set after\nhe finishes his "lost collection."\x0e\0\x04\0Any chance you could speed up the\nprocess by finding the rest of his\nsound discs?\x0e\0\x04\0He said there's, like, \x0e\x03\0\x04\0\0\0\0 left.
W3G3_271	Well, he's got all of his sound discs\nback... I'm never gonna get to play\nthat set, am I?
W3G3_259	Can't talk. Dancin'.
W3G3_266	Did you hear that the sketchy\nlamp shop went out of business?\x0e\0\x04\0Looks like a Toad is interested\nin the space. I wonder what that\nguy has in mind...
W3G3_267	This is my jam!
W3G3_296	Gotta hand it to the DJ. He can\nreally make these Toads move.
W3G3_301	Yo, yo, yo! Good to see you\nagain, my man!
W3G3_325	Hit me with a request!\x0e\x01\x01\0
W3G3_336	Oh, you found some more of\nmy discs? Word! The playlist\nwas getting stale for sure.
W3G3_297	Welcome! I'm new here, and I don't\nhave any idea what I'm doing yet.\nUm...come back when I'm trained?
W3G3_274	The hotel is going through a\nre-org, but I was able to keep\nmy job. No one can pace like me.
W3G3_275	The eyes follow me everywhere I go,\nso I'm never going anywhere again.
W3G3_276	I hear the pool is kind of a crazy\nscene now that the hotel's under\nnew management.
W3G3_277	The Snifits really had some good\nideas for this place while we\nwere gone!\x0e\0\x04\0Some incredibly weird ones too.\nCan't wait to see how this is\nall gonna play out!

W4C1_127	Say! This is the famous cruise ship\nthe Princess Peach!\x0e\0\x04\0I knew it had shipped out recently...\nbut why is it stopped way out here?
W4C1_129	Ah! Here she is, lads. The famous\ncruise ship...the Princess Peach!\x0e\0\x04\0I knew it had shipped out recently...\nbut why is it stopped way out here?
W4C1_67	The secret to saving Olivia is on that\nship, Big M. We'll find it in the VIP\nstateroom on the second level.\x0e\0\x04\0There's an elevator right inside the\nmain hall. Let's head there first!

W4C1_109	Ahh shoot! We can't get in with all\nthis garbage blocking the way.
W4C1_120	Whoa. This looks even worse than\nI remembered.
W4C1_134	You're probably wondering why this\nship is all banged up.\x0e\0\x04\0Long story. I'll explain later, OK?
W4C1_111	Let's hop in that elevator and hurry\nto the VIP stateroom. I have a bad\nfeeling about this place...
W4C1_118	The elevator isn't working? Are you\nKIDDING me?
W4C1_112	Shoot. Power must be out for the\nwhole ship.
W4C1_149	I guess this dark, unlit room should\nhave been our first clue.\x0e\0\x04\0Hmm. Which part of the ship controls\nthe power? Any idea where to start,\nBig M?
W4C1_124	We need to get the power\nworking again!
W4C1_130	\x0e\x02\0\0{s[150]}WAAAH!{s[100]}\x0f\x02\0
W4C1_150	D-dude! Come on! You can't just\nSCREAM like that. Scared me half\nto death!
W4C1_151	I think this Toad is a member of the\ncrew here. Let's, uh...let him rest.
W4C1_44	He's out like the lights. Something\nmust've rattled him real good...
W4C1_62	The power source has to be on this\nship somewhere. Let's keep pokin'\naround.
W4C1_63	It's the Princess Peach! Heh. This\nmodel really takes me back. I had\nso much fun on this ship.\x0e\0\x04\0Bright sunshine, salty sea breeze,\na horizon that seemed to stretch\non forever...\x0e\0\x04\0And...my best buds...
W4C1_64	*ahem* Sorry, Big M. This isn't the\ntime to get caught up in the past.\x0e\0\x04\0Olivia needs us. Let's go!
W4C1_66	Yep. It sure is the Princess Peach...\nGuess you like this ship as much as\nI do, eh, Big M?
W4C1_108	Where are you going, Big M? The\nelevator to the VIP stateroom is\nthe other way!

W4C1_45	Something pounded on the main\nwindow! Something BIG! It was\nso scary...
W4C1_59	Oh! Right. This is the deck where...
W4C1_68	Hey, Big M...\x0e\0\x04\0How much do you know about\nus Bob-ombs?
W4C1_82	The life of a Bob-omb is pretty short,\nall things considered.\x0e\0\x04\0That's why we try to make the most\nof the time we have.
W4C1_81	I guess you'd understand better\nthan most, Big M. You're risking your\nlife to battle those Folded Soldiers...\x0e\0\x04\0Ugh, listen to me. Sorry for the big\nmonologue. Let's keep searching.

W4C1_121	Do they use this stuff to run the\nship? Looks complicated...even\nwithout power.
W4C1_113	I used to dream of being a ship\ncaptain...ooh, or an admiral!\nI bet I'd be a pretty cool admiral.
W4C1_12	A lever! What do you think it does?\x0e\0\x04\0If it was locked up like that, it must\nbe pretty important...

W4C1_141	Oh! That lever is a perfect fit!\x0e\0\x04\0I...I guess we did it!
W4C1_116	Isn't that it? Don't we have to turn\nthe lever? What are we missing?!\x0e\0\x04\0Ugh. I'd make a lousy engineer...
W4C1_46	Mario! It's terrible! There was a\ncrisis! There still IS a crisis!\x0e\0\x04\0I've been stuck in here the whole\ntime, so I don't really know the\ndetails, but...CRISIS!
W4C1_47	I don't really know the details, but\nit sure is fun to scream "CRISIS!"

W4C1_50	Oh no! It's already here!
W4C1_51	That's the door to the VIP\nstateroom. Hurry! Get inside!

W4C1_117	There it is, Big M! That yellow box!

W4C1_70	Bob-omb got...a SUPER-important,\nOlivia-saving item! Ta-ta-ta daaa!\x0e\0\x04\0Now we'll be able to rescue Olivia!
W4C1_28	Thank you, Mario! I'm the captain of\nthe Princess Peach.

W4C1_71	That's great! That means the rest\nof the crew and passengers are all\nsafe somewhere. Phew...\x0e\0\x04\0Speaking of, let's head back to\nSweetpaper Valley and rescue\nOlivia! C'mon, Big M!

W4C1_88	Oh! Is the fog gone? Fantastic!\nThanks for letting us know, Mario!\nToot toot!
W4C1_89	We can't set sail until all of the huge\nholes in the ship have been plugged.\nThat could take a while...\x0e\0\x04\0Toot...
W4C1_91	You can see how many of the ship's\nholes have been fixed in the menu.
W4C1_90	Now we can pick up our former\npassengers that were scattered\nacross the Great Sea!\x0e\0\x04\0Once you're back on your adorable\nlittle ship, we'll head out. Thanks\nagain! Toot—and, might I add—toot!

W4C1_GuestAreaSecond_After_01	The black ink is all gone! Whoever\ncleaned it didn't miss a single spot.
W4C1_EngineRoom_After_01_1	Phew! Sounded like some wild stuff\nwent down. I'm guessing there was\nan emergency...\x0e\0\x04\0I'm also guessing you saved the day\nagain, Mario!
W4C1_EngineRoom_After_01_2	Thanks for patching the engines up,\nMario. Glad they weren't too badly\ndamaged in all that chaos!\x0e\0\x04\0Matter of fact, these babies are\ndoin' better than ever! We're at\n120 percent power!\x0e\0\x04\0That's how percentages work, right?
W4C1_ShipDeck_After_01	Welcome aboard the Princess Peach!
W4C1_ShipDeck_After_23	Oh! Mario! You did it! All of our\nformer passengers made it back\nto the ship in one piece.\x0e\0\x04\0The captain wanted to thank you\nhimself, so pop by the wheelhouse\nand give him a visit!
W4C1_ShipDeck_After_29	The captain wanted to thank you\nhimself, so pop by the wheelhouse\nand give him a visit!
W4C1_ControlRoom_After_04	We're patrolling the Great Sea to\nrescue all the passengers that\nabandoned ship. Toot toot!\x0e\0\x04\0If you see any stranded Toads out\nthere, could you help them out?
W4C1_ControlRoom_After_05	Mario! Thanks to you, we rescued\nALL of the passengers that had\nabandoned the Princess Peach!\x0e\0\x04\0You're a lifesaver! Please, take this\nspecial souvenir with our thanks.\nToot toot!
W4C1_ControlRoom_After_07	The Princess Peach is now free to\nresume regular pleasure-cruising\nprocedures! Toot toot!\x0e\0\x04\0Thank you, Mario. We really owe\nyou one.\x0e\0\x04\0Toot.

W4C1_ControlRoom_After_03	Our captain REALLY loves \nPrincess Peach. And I am\nNOT talkin' about the ship.
W4C1_ControlRoom_After_02	The captain never lets me steer\nthe ship...
W4C1_ControlRoom_After_06	Maybe I can steer the ship just\nfor a couple of quick laps around\none of these islands...
W4C1_ShipDeck_After_30	We're almost ready to welcome our\nstranded passengers back aboard!
W4C1_ShipDeck_After_03	Now THIS is a party boat.
W4C1_ShipDeck_After_02_c	I'm preparing food for our returning\npassengers. Abandoning ship must\nwork up quite an appetite!
W4C1_ShipDeck_After_02_b	Dig in, everyone!
W4C1_ShipDeck_After_02	Excuse me! The other passengers\nare trying to eat! You're making\nthe appetizers FAR less appetizing!\x0e\0\x04\0No one was eating the celery sticks\nbefore, but now—hey! HEY!
W4C1_ShipDeck_After_09	Noooo! Don't look at me!\nI'm so embarrassed!
W4C1_ShipDeck_After_12	Wow, everything looks so tasty!
W4C1_ShipDeck_After_10	I'm starving. That island we were on\ndidn't have any food. Not a single\nbuffet to be found!
W4C1_ShipDeck_After_11	Everyone's here, right? Then let's\nhurry up and EAT!
W4C1_ShipDeck_After_13	I propose a toast. Here's to great\nfriends, good food, and family-\nfriendly glasses of fruit juice!
W4C1_ShipDeck_After_05	I love everything about this cruise...\nEven that naked guy who's causing\na scene!
W4C1_ShipDeck_After_06	This party is OK, I guess...but I kinda\nmiss my tiny treasure chest back on\nthat island.
W4C1_ShipDeck_After_26	Being on a croissant moon made me\nSUPER hungry. Bring on the carbs!
W4C1_ShipDeck_After_27	It's hard to eat a fish after you've\nbeen a fish. Sorry, little guy... I'm so\nhungry...
W4C1_ShipDeck_After_28	Enjoying the fish? Wanna guess\nwho caught 'em? Here's a hint...\nIt was me!
W4C1_ShipDeck_After_07	Remember how I was searching for\nmy friend on that mushroom island?\nWell, we finally found each other!
W4C1_ShipDeck_After_08	My friend and I finally reunited!\nI'm not sure who this other guy\nis, though...
W4C1_ShipDeck_After_31	I don't want to work on this cruise\nanymore! I want to ENJOY it...
W4C1_ShipDeck_After_22	{s[075]}I'm supposed to be working on this ship, but\nI shuffled in with the other passengers. Now I\ncan stuff myself silly! Don't rat me out, OK?{s[100]}
W4C1_ShipDeck_After_14	Cruising is so much fun! Yaaay!
W4C1_ShipDeck_After_15	Ooh, that Blooper! What a jerk! GRAAAH!
W4C1_ShipDeck_After_16	The sea is so big...and empty...*sigh*
W4C1_ShipDeck_After_17	I'm just happy to be here! Hyuk!
W4C1_ShipDeck_After_32	Oh...I just can't relax without\nknowing if my favorite pop group\nis OK out there...
W4C1_ShipDeck_After_25	Everyone in Feelin' Fungi is SO cute!\nHey, Joy! Joooy! Look over heeere!
W4C1_ShipDeck_After_24	Perhaps "paradise" can only be\nfound through inner peace...\x0e\0\x04\0Just kidding. Paradise has GOTTA\nbe a real place. I bet it RULES.
W4C1_Lounge_After_05	I'm back aboard...and restored!\x0e\0\x04\0I was stuck on Bonehead Island.\nI'm in dire need of some smilin'.\nKnow what I could use? A cruise!
W4C1_StoreRoom_After_01	Finally, all that black gunk has been\nmopped up! You wiped your feet\nbefore walking in here...right, Mario?
W4C1_EngineRoom_After_03	Rope was cut. I fixed it!
W4C1_EngineRoom_After_02	Stairway was busted. I fixed it!
W4C1_VIPRoom_After_01	This is the VIP stateroom. It's for\nVIPs ONLY, so we've got to keep\nit tidy at all times.\x0e\0\x04\0After saving this whole ship, you're\nthe most VI of all Ps, Mario! Feel free\nto use this room at your leisure.

W4C2_30	{s[075]}I bet we're thinking the same thing right now...{s[100]}
W4C2_31	{s[075]}It's S-S-SUPER cold here...{s[100]}\x0e\0\x04\0{s[075]}Why is it so c-c-cold?{s[100]}
W4C2_17	{s[075]}Oh wait. I think I know what's going on.\nThis chill must mean...{s[100]}
W4C2_20	The Ice Vellumental is nearby!\x0e\0\x04\0If that's the case, let's hurry inside!\nI want to see how COOL this one\nlooks. Eh? Ehhh?\x0e\0\x04\0No laugh, eh? At least the statues\nthought my ice joke was funny...
W4C2_22	Excuuuuse meeee! You up there!\nWould you mind NOT stomping\naround like that?!
W4C2_1	Wow. This bear sure has an ICE, big\nsmile! Eh? Ehhh?\x0e\0\x04\0Those teeth sure look sturdy.\nThey won't be easy to break...
W4C2_15	Wait a second. This looks...familiar,\ndoesn't it?\x0e\0\x04\0It looks like...half of a Magic Circle!\nWho would leave an important mark\nlike this half-finished?
W4C2_27	Oh! It's the rest of the Magic Circle!\nWhere did it come from? Did it...\nfinish itself somehow?
W4C2_18	There's no way we can get over\nthese spikes with a simple jump...
W4C2_26	WOO! That was fun! Who could have\nguessed we'd get to go ice sledding\nat the bottom of the ocean?\x0e\0\x04\0I think we were launched into the\npeak of the second mountain...\nWhat is this place?
W4C2_3	Oh no! The Ice Vellumental has been\nfolded into origami too!\x0e\0\x04\0It controls ice, so it might be EXTRA\nstrong in here! Be careful, Mario!
W4C2_4	It's the Ice Vellumental's Bibliofold!
W4C2_7	OK! Let's get right down to it...\x0e\0\x04\0Hmm... Hmmmm... Ohhh, I get it.\nFold here, like this...and connect\nthese two like this... Ah, sneaky!\x0e\0\x04\0Uh huh... Uhhh huh... All right!
W4C2_8	I think I've got it. Now I can fold\nmyself into the Ice Vellumental!\nI think!
W4C2_14	Let's get right to it. I'm gonna take\nthis new form for a spin!
W4C2_23	I'm f-f-freezing my f-f-folds off...\x0e\0\x04\0Even as the Ice Vellumental, I'm still\nso cold...
W4C2_24	But if I let that stop me, it'll take\nforever to master these awesome\nice powers!\x0e\0\x04\0I'll deal with the chill. Watch me\nplay this one...cooool.
W4C2_9	Wow! Do you see what ICY? Eh?\nI froze the water into solid ice!
W4C2_32	OK! Now we can head out of here.\x0e\0\x04\0The water is frozen, so let's cross\nthis moat and get out of here!
W4C2_10	Don't fall, Mario!\nQuick, grab on to me!
W4C2_11	Perfect landing! See? These statues\nloved it. What a great audience!
W4C3.msbt
W4C3_1	Shall we ship out?\x0e\x01\x04\x14\n\0y\0e\0s\0n\0o\0\x01\0\0\0\0\0\0\0
W4C3_7	Wooooow! It's so taaaaaaaall!\nMy neck hurts just lookin' at it!\x0e\0\x04\0It's like it's piercing the sky.\nIt stretches up...and up...and up...\x0e\0\x04\0And so does the purple streamer!
W4C3_6	I can't wait to climb our way up\nthis thing. Think of all the floors\nwe'll get to explore!\x0e\0\x04\0That's probably less exciting when\nyou can't float...but it'll still be fun!
W4C3_14	Now...hhhhhow do we climb it?
W4C3_8	Hmm. What do you think these\nthree openings are for?
W4C3_11	That seems like the wrong shape\nAND the wrong size...
W4C3_15	Oh! It's a door! That seems pretty\nobvious in hindsight.\x0e\0\x04\0Let's head inside! I can't wait to get\nto the top...assuming it doesn't just\ngo on forever.
W4C3_4	Oh my gosh! It's a meeting of the\nfour Vellumentals! Earth, water,\nfire, and ice!\x0e\0\x04\0H-hello! So nice to see you all again!\x0e\0\x04\0...Oh. They're just statues.\nI knew that.
W4C3_20	Oh no! What happened to the\nEarth Vellumental's face?!\x0e\0\x04\0It's split in two for some reason...\nThat must have hurt.
W4C3_21	And the Water Vellumental only has\none eye! Or maybe it's winking down\nat us... It's all so mysterious!
W4C3_17	Aww, it looks sad. Maybe a little\npresent will cheer it up!\x0e\x01\x04\x18\x0e\0K\0e\0y\0I\0t\0e\0m\0\xff\xff\xff\xff\0\0\0\0
W4C3_31	What's it eating? Do you think it's\ntasty? I bet it's tasty...
W4C3_18	I don't think that's what it wants.
W4C3_19	Hooray! The Earth Vellumental's\nface is back together! Just look\nat that happy smile.
W4C3_35	Whoa! Why are there Toads stuck\nto the side of this tower?!\x0e\0\x04\0I don't see anything holding them\nagainst the wall... How are they\nstaying up?
W4C3_48	Hmm. On closer look, these Toads\nseem to be strapped to the wall\nwith some kind of...tape?\x0e\0\x04\0Poor Toads\x0e\x01\x01\0... They're stuck in such\nunflattering positions! I would be so,\nso embarrassed.
W4C3_49	Nooo! My dignityyy!
W4C3_36	Whoa. It's a staring contest between\nthe Fire and Ice Vellumentals!\x0e\0\x04\0Wonder who's gonna win? I'd bet\nmy coins on the Ice Vellumental.\nIts fangs are so intimidating!
W4C3_40	Oh ho ho! The Ice Vellumental was\ngrinning, but it couldn't bear it!\nThe Fire Vellumental wins this one!
W4C3_56	Hey! We reached the top! Wow, look\nhow high up we are...
W4C3_27	And look what else is up here!\nWe finally found the end of the\npurple streamer!
W4C3_28	But...how are we supposed to get up\nthere and smash the spool?
W4C3_16	\x0e\x02\0\0{s[120]}Hey! I'm elevatin' here!{s[100]}\x0f\x02\0
W4C3_5	You Mario? I got a message for you\nfrom the boss. How 'bout ya come\nover here so I can give it to ya?\x0e\0\x04\0And you, origami kid... Be a good\ngoil and run back to Olly. It's past\nyour beddy-bye time, capisce?\x0e\0\x04\0You two were gonna try and take\ndis streamer out of the picture, eh?\nI come in strips too, ya know.\x0e\0\x04\0You got a grudge wit' things dat\nwrap over other things? You think\nI'm some kinda JOKE? EH?
W4C3_59	Guess we know who stuck those\nToads to the tower now.\x0e\0\x04\0Sheesh. How did all these harmless\norigami-making tools end up with\nsuch tacky personalities?
W4C3_62	HEY! I'm not tacky! I'm STICKY!\nDAT'S IT! Ya want a piece of me?\nWell, you're gonna get it!
W4C3_45	Aaah! It hoits! It HOITS!\x0e\0\x04\0Don't do dis to me! I'm a changed\nadhesive! I won't stick nobody up\nno more, I swear!\x0e\0\x04\0Boss! Olly! Ya gotta do somethin'!\nYa gotta avenge me! I'm... I'm...\x0e\0\x04\0Ehhhhh, fuhgeddaboudit.
W4C3_50	All right! We can reach the streamer\nnow, Mario. You know what to do!
W3C4_65	Let's get rid of that purple streamer!
W4C3_38	Hooray! Now there's just one\nstreamer left.
W4C3_58	I don't think we've seen the last one\nyet, have we? It could be anywhere.
W4C3_63	Do we even know what color it is?\nWe took down the red one, then\nthe blue one, then...
W4C3_39	HUH?! Has that green streamer been\nthere this WHOLE time?!
W4C3_42	It goes up...and up...and up. Gosh.\nIt's going up above the clouds!
W4C3_43	How in the world are we supposed\nto follow THAT?
W4C3_44	I can't float up that high, and it\nlooks way too high to jump...even\nfor you, Mario!
W4C3_64	Maybe there's some kind of hint \nup here. Wishful thinking, but you\nnever know!
W4C3_57	{c[e67928]}\x0e\x02\0\0Let four fold into one and\x0f\x02\0\n\x0e\x02\0\0point you toward paradise.\x0f\x02\0{c[404040]}
W4C3_46	That light! It's going PYOOOW,\nright through the clouds!
W4C3_47	The light...\x0e\0\x04\0The light is...calling to us...
W4C3_32	Descend one floor?\x0e\x01\x04\x14\n\0y\0e\0s\0n\0o\0\x01\0\0\0\0\0\0\0

W4G1_40	WOOOOOW!\nThe Great Sea is SOOO big!\nThis breeze feels SOOO good!\x0e\0\x04\0*sniff*\nWhy does it smell SOOO salty?
W4G1_72	It's so endlessly big... The only word\nyou could use to describe it is EPIC!\x0e\0\x04\0Well, that and "great," I guess.
W4G1_43	Oh! Look! There's the purple\nstreamer. What's it doing way\nout here on the Great Sea?
W4G1_69	Looks like it stretches out...\nreeeally far...\x0e\0\x04\0The Great Sea is huge. We'd better\nstick close to the streamer so we\ndon't lose track of it!
W4G1_127	Hey! Is that another streamer?\x0e\0\x04\0Those things really are everywhere.
W4G1_139	Thanks for taking me all the way out\nto the Great Sea, Big M.\x0e\0\x04\0I've got a plan to rescue Olivia, but\nwe'll need a special item first.\x0e\0\x04\0It'll be found on the luxury ship\nthe Princess Peach. It should still\nbe out here. Somewhere. I hope.\x0e\0\x04\0Once we get our hands on that item,\nwe can save Olivia in no time!

W4G1_140	Yeah! Bonehead Island, here we come!\x0e\x01\0\x04\xb8\x0b\0\0
W4G1_338	This fog is unbelievable! Can't see\nthrough it at all...\x0e\0\x04\0We'd just get lost in that mess.\nBetter turn back before we get\nourselves in trouble.
W4G1_336	Ahh, what a pain in the port bow!\nWish we had a sea chart... Then we\ncould navigate through this haze!
W4G1_382	Say, speaking of sea charts...you\ntwo ever heard the legend of the\nlegendary Captain Ode?\x0e\0\x04\0Legends speak of a legendary Toad\nwho moved beneath the waves and\nowned a legendary sea chart.\x0e\0\x04\0Ahhh, but those are just...tall tales.\nNot much truth behind 'em, I reckon.\x0e\0\x04\0If only they were true! A sea chart\nlike that might help us cut right\nthrough this blasted fog...
W4G1_339	Ode? Ode... Hmmm. Why does\nthat sound familiar?
W4G1_381	Do you mean Captain T. Ode?\nWe know that guy! He said\nhe'd be at the mus\xe9e.
W4G1_390	HA HA HA! Ahh, you jokers! That\nmight be the most ridiculous fib\nI've ever heard!\x0e\0\x04\0You met a legendary captain from\nancient times, and he's just hanging\nout in a dusty ol' museum?! HA!\x0e\0\x04\0...You're serious? Well, what are we\nwaitin' for? Let's head straight for\nthat museum!
W4G1_29	No time to island hop, Big M. Let's\nhead to the Princess Peach!
W4G1_213	C'mon, Big M! Olivia's counting on us!
W4G1_411	Whoaaa, avast!\x0e\x01\0\x04\xc4\t\0\0

W4G1_113	Mario! Look! The streamer dips into\nthe sea. How are we supposed to\nfollow it down there?!
W4G1_54	Ah! There's an island out here!
W4G1_36	\x0e\x03\x01\x04\xcd\xccL>A square island. Curious. What\nmysteries await us there, I wonder?\x0f\x03\x01
W4G1_37	What's this? An abandoned ship\nway out here? There's a story\nbehind this, and no mistake...
W4G1_147	That's it, Big M! That's\nthe Princess Peach!
W4G1_60	\x0e\x03\x01\x04\xcd\xccL>Ah, so that's the vessel known as\nthe Princess Peach? How...subtle.\x0f\x03\x01
W4G1_305	Whoa. A creepy skull!\x0e\x01\0\x04\xb8\x0b\0\0

W4G1_308	\x0e\x03\x01\x04\xcd\xccL>This one is unmistakably spade-\nshaped. We'll call it...Spade Island.\x0f\x03\x01
W4G1_309	\x0e\x03\x01\x04\xcd\xccL>A question mark. I see. Then I shall\nname this enigmatic isle...? Island.\n{s[075]}Hm. This one definitely works better on paper.{s[100]}\x0f\x03\x01
W4G1_310	\x0e\x03\x01\x04\xcd\xccL>A hammer, floating alone among the\nwaves. I'll call it...Hammer Island.\x0f\x03\x01

W4G1_33	What the— This tower is massive!\nWhat kind of island is this?
W4G1_35	\x0e\x03\x01\x04\xcd\xccL>A tower standing in the Great Sea.\nThat's...the Sea Tower. Obviously.\x0f\x03\x01
W4G1_34	The purple streamer wraps all the\nway to the top! This one might be\na bit trickier.

W4G1_224	Wow! Look at the size of this thing!\nI kinda want to cook it...sssomehow.\nWhere can we do that?
W4G1_225	A can?! Out here? Hmm. Bet there's\nsomething good inside. Where's a\ncan opener when you need one?
W4G1_30	Wh-what is this?! It's HUUUGE!\x0e\x01\0\x04\xc4\t\0\0

W4G1_14	Argh! I dropped it! SPLOOSH!\nA fat sack of precious coins,\nright into the ol' drink...
W4G1_15	*gasp* My wallet!\x0e\0\x04\0You found it? And didn't keep it?!\nAmazing! Please, take this reward\nfor being so trustworthy.
W4G1_23	I'll never let this huge sack of coins\nout of my sight ever again.
W4G1_6	There's an island in this sea where\nyou can battle GIANTS! It's true!\x0e\0\x04\0If you're itching to fight some big ol'\nbrutes, just find the reef below here\nand head, uhh...left?\x0e\0\x04\0I'm not sure which way is which.\nThose giants hit me pretty hard.
W4G1_10	I can see something shiny on the\nsea floor! It's treasure. It has to\nbe treasure!
W4G1_13	Wha?! Pffsh, it's just a can.\nI was way, way off.\x0e\0\x04\0It hasn't been opened yet...\nThink the food inside is still good?
W4G1_19	Hey! How was that canned food?\nWas it a hearty meal, at least?
W4G1_50	This fog is incredible, eh?\nCan't move forward if you don't\nknow which way you're going...\x0e\0\x04\0I read that on a twist off cap once.\nThat bottle of juice was so wise...
W4G1_56	This sea is wicked huge, eh?\nIf you're ever feeling lost, just\ncheck your sea chart.\x0e\0\x04\0Hey, that sounded smart enough to\nbe printed on a bottle cap. I'm ready\nfor the big leagues!
W4G1_4	You folks seen that big streamer\ndippin' into the Great Sea?\x0e\0\x04\0Looks like it dives pretty far down.\nWhere did it come from? What's it\ndoin' down there? Such mysteries...
W4G1_5	That streamer is gone! I never even\nfound out where it came from...\nMysteries upon mysteries!
W4G1_57	The Great Sea is vast and untamed.\nThat means...plenty of room to gun\nthat motor! Use  to boost! WOO!
W4G1_62	With a powered-up ship like that,\nI bet you can boost right through\nenemies by pressing  ! WOO!
W4G1_3	Dude! Have you noticed that huge\nshell sittin' pretty on the sea floor?\x0e\0\x04\0There's no way you could swim\nthat far down, yo. You'd need\nto dive way, WAY down...
W4G1_8	Whoa! You got that big shell, dude!\x0e\0\x04\0If you tossed that sucker on a BBQ,\nit'd probably be MONDO tasty...but\nwhere would you find enough wood?
W4G1_17	Was the big shell mondo tasty?\nI knew it. I knew it, bro.
W4G1_18	I've heard there are 11 islands\nout there on the ocean! I just...\ndon't know where they are.
W4G1_27	You found all 11 islands?! Wow!\nIf any of them are better than this\ntiny little rock...don't tell me.
W4G1_58	I heard there's a reef shaped like a\nBlooper out here...so why can't I\nfind it on my sea chart?
W4G1_61	If you go down and left from here,\nyou'll find an island shaped like a\nclub symbol. Geology is wild, man.
W4G1_64	What's with the Toad statues on all\nthese islands? What happens if you\nfind 'em all? So many mysteries!
W4G1_389	Ooh... Sure is creepy.\x0e\0\x04\0Is it just me, or is that big, ugly\nskull face...staring at us?
W4G1_380	\x0e\x03\x01\x04\xcd\xccL>Don't surrender to fear. You must\nexplore this island. Secrets await...\nand I want to hear what they are.\x0f\x03\x01
W4G1_74	\x0e\x02\0\0If you seek paradise,\x0f\x02\0\n\x0e\x02\0\0gather the three orbs \x0f\x02\0\n\x0e\x02\0\0on Diamond Island\x0f\x02\0
W4G1_129	Pair-of-dice? What in the world\nis this statue talking about?
W4G1_75	\x0e\x02\0\0Seek and ye shall find...\x0f\x02\0\n\x0e\x02\0\0Come, follow me to\x0f\x02\0\n\x0e\x02\0\0paradise...\x0f\x02\0
W4G1_332	Ooh, this sounds like fun!\x0e\0\x04\0But...well, I guess we need to deal\nwith the purple streamer first.
W4G1_385	Wooow! The fog totally vanished!\nThat was amazing!
W4G1_102	You saved me! As thanks, let me\nshow you where to find a sunken\ntreasure! I'd claim it, but...I'm lazy.
W4G1_103	I'm lost at sea, see?\x0e\0\x04\0Hate being stranded. Can't stand it.\nBeen waitin' for a rescue...from you!
W4G1_392	Yes! That awful fog is finally gone.\nNow we can explore the rest of this\nbig ol' ocean!
W4G1_387	Aha! There's the streamer over\nthere! Let's follow it, Mario!
W4G1_77	Hmm! These marks look...important.\x0e\0\x04\0No idea what they're trying to say.\nThey might come in handy, though,\nso I'll sketch a quick copy.\x0e\0\x04\0If you want to see these symbols\nagain, press  on the Great Sea\nand I'll show them to you!
W4G1_333	I've already added this mark to my\ncopy. Press  to take a look!
W4G1_83	More weird marks! I still don't know\nwhat this is about...but I might as\nwell update my copy to match.
W4G1_337	Huh. I don't think we'll have to\nworry about these symbols...\nCall it a hunch.
W4G1_65	Wow, this island really does look like\nthe moon!\x0e\0\x04\0So when it's shaped like this, it's\ncalled a crescent moon? Huh!\nLearn something new every day...
W4G1_31	Oh! A rescue! How lovely. Allow me\nto reveal the location of a sunken\ntreasure as a way of saying thanks.
W4G1_46	I wish I could try fishing for myself...\x0e\0\x04\0Uh—meaning I wish I could give\nfishing a try. I don't have any desire\nto fish for myself as a fish. Ha ha.\x0e\0\x04\0{s[075]}I'm not weird. YOU'RE weird.{s[100]}
W4G1_47	I...I was swimming. In the ocean.\nBut now I'm...on dry land? What's\nhappening? I'm so confused!
W4G1_120	This island is shaped like a\n"croissant moon." I'm a bit\nof a lunar-calendar buff.
W4G1_121	Whoa! This island isn't a croissant\nmoon at all! It's, uh...a kaiser roll?\nMaybe a bagel?\x0e\0\x04\0I enjoy a good bagel, but when\nyou expect a croissant, it's a bit\nof a letdown.
W4G1_9	\x0e\x02\0\0Start fishing?\x0f\x02\0\x0e\x01\x04\x14\n\0y\0e\0s\0n\0o\0\x01\0\0\0\0\0\0\0
W4G1_12	\x0e\x02\0\0Stop fishing?\x0f\x02\0\x0e\x01\x04\x14\n\0y\0e\0s\0n\0o\0\x01\0\0\0\0\0\0\0
W4G1_11	I wonder what I'm supposed to do\nhere as the Earth Vellumental...\x0e\0\x04\0I guess I'll just freestyle it and see\nwhat happens. Ready? OK!
W4G1_20	WHOA! The crescent moon turned\ninto a full moon! How cool! I mean,\nuh...I knew that would happen.
W4G1_173	\x0e\x02\0\0To collect the three orbs, you\x0f\x02\0\n\x0e\x02\0\0must journey to Diamond Island.\x0f\x02\0
W4G1_152	Oooh! What's in there? Is it big?\nDo you think it's valuable? It could\nbe anything! I'm SO excited!
W4G1_154	You have solved this island's test!\nThe Diamond Key is now yours.
W4G1_153	Huh? I don't see a key in here.\nIs this...a letter?
W4G1_159	Hey, Bro! Got the key! Come find me\non the mushroom-shaped island!\n\x0e\x02\x02\0{c[2e7611]}Luigi{c[404040]}\x0f\x02\x02
W4G1_174	Luigi was here first?! How in the\nworld did he find this chest?\x0e\0\x04\0There's something else in here...
W4G1_177	What is this thing? Looks like it fits\nin your hand pretty well.
W4G1_394	Those who have claimed the key—\nlet my map guide your quest.
W4G1_21	\x0e\x03\x01\x04\xcd\xccL>Ah. The crescent moon has filled out\nto become a FULL moon...\x0f\x03\x01\x0e\0\x04\0\x0e\x03\x01\x04\xcd\xccL>Thus, Crescent Moon Island shall\nnow be known as...Full Moon Island.\x0f\x03\x01
W4G1_301	Hey! Hellooo!
W4G1_286	Hey! Help! Help meee!
W4G1_124	Yay! Thanks, Mario! If you had time\nto save me, I'm guessing you have\na bit MORE time to spare...
W4G1_130	I want to get to that relaxing spot\njust past this tall grass, but there\nare too many bad guys!\x0e\0\x04\0You've got time to escort me there,\nright? Thanks! No need to answer.\nI'll just follow you silently.
W4G1_104	Yaaay! Thanks, Mario! You've been\na big help...\x0e\0\x04\0And I know you'll KEEP being a big\nhelp by making sure my three friends\nmake it out of the grass to join me!\x0e\0\x04\0Yaaaaay!
W4G1_105	My three friends are out in that tall\ngrass. Thanks for offering to bring\nthem here! Yaaay!
W4G1_106	Still waiting on two more friends!\nThey're in that grass somewhere!
W4G1_107	There's still oooooone final friend\nlost in that tall grass somewhere!

W4G1_117	Oops! Not this way, silly!
W4G1_133	RRGH! No! Not THAT way!

W4G1_376	Oh. You don't have enough coins.
W4G1_377	All right! Just gimme a quick sec.
W4G1_378	OK! You're all set, buddy. Need\nanything else? A new watch?\nDental work, maybe? I do fillings...
W4G1_379	Oh. All right. Just go about your\nbusiness, then. We never talked.
W4G1_45	Disappointed I'm not a real heart?\x0e\0\x04\0Don't let YOUR heart be troubled by\nsuch a thing. Love is all around us!
W4G1_48	See? Toldja so.
W4G1_95	Sorry. I'm not treasure. I'm just me.\x0e\0\x04\0But I DO know where you can find a\nREAL treasure out on the ocean!
W4G1_126	It's like a super-cozy tiny house in\nhere. I could sleep, eat, AND bathe\nin the same cramped space!
W4G1_86	\x0e\x02\0\0{s[120]}Seek ye a path to paradise{s[100]}\x0f\x02\0
W4G1_76	GUH! Phew! I'm saved! Here, let me\nshow you where to fish for some\ntreasure as thanks.
W4G1_88	Phew! I'm all sweaty. Was it real hot\na minute ago, or was it just me?
W4G1_145	Hey! I'm in a real pickle here! My\nfriends should be able to help...if\nyou can find them on this island!
W4G1_119	Ah!
W4G1_118	WHOA! This looks bad!\nHang on, friend! I'm comin'!
W4G1_132	We'll save you!
W4G1_51	Thanks for saving all of us!\nEspecially me!\x0e\0\x04\0I don't have a reward for you...but\nI can show you a cool spot to fish\nfor treasure out here!
W4G1_59	Wha?! My vest is gone! Nooo!\nThe world can see my shame!
W4G1_63	We won't let our friend be\nhumiliated! Dignity huddle,\nACTIVATED!
W4G1_67	Phew. I suppose the one thing any\nToad really needs is good friends.\x0e\0\x04\0And a backup vest. For emergencies.
W4G1_215	Oh my gosh. This whole house is\nencased in a block of ice! Hope the\npeople inside are OK...
W4G1_128	*gasp*\nFinally! After days and days of\nswimming...I made it to this island.\x0e\0\x04\0My friend and I promised to meet\nhere in case of a HUGE DISASTER.\nI wonder where they are...
W4G1_53	*gasp*\nThank you! I thought I'd be stuck\nas a fish forever. Here, you can\nclaim this treasure as a reward!
W4G1_85	My friend and I promised to meet\nhere in case of a BIG EMERGENCY.\nI wonder where they are...
W4G1_216	Doesn't look like anyone is home.\x0e\0\x04\0This is clearly SOMEBODY'S house...\nWhere do you think they could be\nhiding on such a tiny island?
W4G1_178	This door is missing something.\nI can't quite put my finger on it...\x0e\0\x04\0Or any part of my hand, for that\nmatter. There's no way to open it!\x0e\0\x04\0Do we have a spare handle handy?\x0e\x01\x04\x18\x0e\0K\0e\0y\0I\0t\0e\0m\0\xff\xff\xff\xff\0\0\0\0

W4G1_179	That's...creative...but definitely\nnot what this door needs.
W4G1_192	Perfect fit! Now THIS is a door.
W4G1_165	Luigi!\x0e\0\x04\0What are you doing napping here?!
W4G1_170	*smack, smack* Hm?\x0e\0\x04\0Ah, is that you, Bro? I wondered\nwhen you would finally get here.\x0e\0\x04\0I've been super busy. It's-a really\nhard to swim in overalls, y'know?\x0e\0\x04\0But now? I'm-a relaxing to the max.\nI've earned a break...'cause I finally\nfound the key to Peach's Castle!
W4G1_217	Oh, hey! It's a key with a little \ndiamond design on it!\x0e\0\x04\0I'm sure this is a key to something\nimportant, but it doesn't look like\nthe key to Peach's Castle.
W4G1_167	Luigi...\x0e\0\x04\0Ohhhhh, dear, sweet Luigi...\x0e\0\x04\0This...still isn't the right key.
W4G1_168	Whaaat? Wrong again?!\x0e\0\x04\0Ahhh, I DID think it was kinda weird.\nThat key isn't Peach's style at all...
W4G1_169	I've gotta say, you live in SUCH a\ncute little house, Luigi!
W4G1_26	Oh, this place isn't mine. I just\nstopped here for a nap. Swimming\nacross the sea tuckered me out!
W4G1_66	Now that you mention it...I didn't\nsee anyone here when I arrived.\x0e\0\x04\0I should probably find whoever lives\nhere and thank them for letting me\ncatch a quick nap on their island.
W4G1_171	Bro! Aren't you gonna help me find\nthe owner of this island? They must\nbe here somewhere...
W4G1_409	Wowie! There's origami everywhere!\x0e\0\x04\0Whoever lives here must REALLY\nlove origami.
W4G1_397	Oh my gosh! I can't believe I forgot!\nFeels like a lifetime ago. I know our\nquest is far from over, but...\x0e\0\x04\0It's good to be home.
W4G1_398	\x0e\x02\0\0{s[150]}HOME?!{s[100]}\x0f\x02\0
W4G1_404	Yep! This room is where I was born.
W4G1_399	I was folded here by my brother.\nHe's actually a skilled origami\ncraftsman, y'know.\x0e\0\x04\0He folded me so well that I came to\nlife. That's why I can talk and float\nand talk and dance...and talk! Heh!
W4G1_401	Wait a minute. Your brother folded\nyou to life...but he's also origami...\x0e\0\x04\0So...who folded HIM?
W4G1_406	...I can hear you...\x0e\0\x04\0I'm trapped in a space between\ndimensions... H-help me, please...
W4G1_402	That voice... Someone's here!\nAnd they might be the person\nwho folded my brother to life!
W4G1_415	Is THAT who lives on this island?\nWe should probably rescue them!\nRight, Bro?
W4G1_163	Mario! That person may have folded\nmy brother... We have to help them!
W4G1_164	It's cramped...and dark...
W4G1_176	Is he stuck in the wall? Poor guy.
W4G1_413	I want to help him, but...I can't do\nanything without a Magic Circle!
W4G1_313	Check this out, Bro! There's a weird\nbook over here.\x0e\0\x04\0It's too high to reach! I don't think\na regular jump is gonna do the trick.
W4G1_314	...I just got a great idea!
W4G1_322	Hit me!

W4G1_267	The folding world is abuzz with\nrumors of a secret technique that\ncan bring origami creations to life!\x0e\0\x04\0How does it work? What's the secret\nbehind it? And, most importantly...\x0e\0\x04\0who will be the first craftsman to\nmaster its forbidden folds?
W4G1_273	Ooh, a little more!
W4G1_274	Somebody's in there!
W4G1_268	Phew! Thanks for saving me...Mario?!\nWow! A real celebrity is visiting my\nworkshop! And Luigi is here too!\x0e\0\x04\0I'm the Origami Craftsman. I live a\nhumble life, folding origami. From\nsunup to sundown. EVERY day.\x0e\0\x04\0...I REALLY love origami.
W4G1_269	You're an origami craftsman? Are\nyou the one who folded my brother?
W4G1_270	Olivia?! Crease my corners! Is that\nreally you?\x0e\0\x04\0You look just how I designed you!\nWho in the world folded you?! And\nwhy aren't you with Olly?
W4G1_272	Well, I'm a little fuzzy on the details,\nbut here's what I remember...
W4G1_277	I see. Olly...what have you done?\x0e\0\x04\0You are correct, Olivia. It was I who\nfolded your brother.\x0e\0\x04\0I wanted to make him truly unique,\nso I used a secret technique to bring\nhim to life.\x0e\0\x04\0Olly was proud and strong...but very\nangry. He turned on me, trapped me\nin a realm between light and dark...\x0e\0\x04\0which turned out to be just a\nwall, I guess. How embarrassing.\x0e\0\x04\0I'm guessing he completed you after\nthat, Olivia. It seems he also ran off\nwith my best origami-making tools.
W4G1_279	Excuse-a me, your Origami-ness,\nbut...why did you fold Olly in the\nfirst place?
W4G1_285	I had intended for him to be a part\nof the Origami Castle I was building\nfor the Origami Festival.\x0e\0\x04\0Both Olly the Origami King and his\nsister, Olivia, were to sit up top as\nthe finishing touches.\x0e\0\x04\0I don't get to celebrate my craft\nvery often, so I might have gone\na bit...overboard.
W4G1_304	I cannot believe that Olly managed\nto fold you on his own, Olivia.\x0e\0\x04\0He can use the Fold of Life.\nOrigami has folded origami.\nIt defies the natural order!\x0e\0\x04\0I'm responsible for all of this. I wish\nI'd never used that darn Fold of Life\ntechnique...
W4G1_278	No, Origami Craftsman! Don't say\nthat. I really love being alive!\x0e\0\x04\0I've seen so many beautiful things...\nand made so many new friends and\nhappy memories...\x0e\0\x04\0If we can just face my brother again,\nI know we can talk him out of this.\x0e\0\x04\0We'll convince him to put his anger\naside and live peacefully with\neveryone, folded or otherwise!
W4G1_280	Oh, right! THAT's why we need the\nkey to Peach's Castle!\x0e\0\x04\0What am I doing?! I have to find\nthat key so we can face Olly!\x0e\0\x04\0Bye-bye, everybody! See ya, Bro!
W4G1_281	Hey, that reminds me...what do you\nthink Luigi's Diamond Key unlocks?\x0e\0\x04\0His wrong keys always end up being\nimportant, so this is probably a clue\nto our next stop.
W4G1_284	It must have something to do with\nthe purple streamer, Mario.\x0e\0\x04\0If we search more of the Great Sea,\nI'm sure this key will unlock the\nway forward!
W4G1_283	Remarkable. Truly remarkable. Your\njourney with Mario has made you\nstrong, Olivia—and so kind!\x0e\0\x04\0I may not have folded you myself,\nbut...I'm proud of you.\x0e\0\x04\0I don't know how to stop Olly.\nI failed once. I'd only fail again.\nI'll have to leave him to you two.\x0e\0\x04\0Please, Mario...keep Olivia safe on\nyour adventure.
W4G1_302	OK! Let's go stop my brother!
W4G1_161	I'm so sorry for the trouble that Olly\nand I have caused you, Mario...\nPlease, look after Olivia for me.
W4G1_162	Wait!
W4G1_166	Take these notes with you, Olivia.\nI hope they can help you...
W4G1_172	Is this... Oh my gosh! Th-thank you!

W5C1_47	Wait...this is the same spot where\nwe just were. What a strange pipe!
W5C1_50	If I might weigh in...\x0e\0\x04\0The pipe would seem to be blocked\nat its exit. As for where that exit\nis located? I cannot say.
W5C1_49	I suspect the pipe leads precisely\nwhere we must go...
W5C1_86	Yikes...that path sure is narrow.\x0e\0\x04\0I don't want to go that way, Mario!\nLook how far down it drops.
W5C1_87	Eeee! It's so scary! Why would they\nmake it so scary?!
W5C1_79	Oh, that's a nice breeze.
W5C1_3	That was too much! Do you see\nhow far it blew us?\x0e\0\x04\0That little breeze could have blown\nus into the trees! Sorry, I know this\nis no time for my cute poetry...
W5C1_4	Hmm. Have either of you observed\nthis chain?\x0e\0\x04\0It almost seems as though it were\nplaced here for this exact purpose!
W5C1_9	I'm quite certain we'll need to\nmove in this direction to reach\nthe other end of the pipe.\x0e\0\x04\0Why don't you simply proceed\nwith caution, pressing  each\ntime the wind rises?\x0e\0\x04\0You can trust me—I'm Kamek.
W5C1_10	Did you hear that? We can trust\nhim—he's Kamek! I'm good with\nthat, Mario.
W5C1_53	Nevertheless, despite the clear\nsafety at hand, I will remain here\nwith Young Master Bowser.
W5C1_55	Do you hear that, milord? Mario will\ntake care of this pipe situation. It's\nreally his purview.\x0e\0\x04\0I'll keep you safe here with me.
W5C1_56	Whatever. Hurry up!\x0e\x01\0\x04\xb8\x0b\0\0
W5C1_58	Be careful, Mario! You won't be\nable to open the menu, and I won't\nbe able to come out and help you.\nNot even if you press !
W5C1_57	When the wind kicks up, just grab\non to the chain by pressing .\nHonestly, I don't see the big deal.
W5C1_71	Kamek's not here yet, Mario.
W5C1_5	Hopefully that does the trick.\nI'll call Kamek.
W5C1_7	{s[120]}Heyyyy!{s[100]}
W5C1_12	Kammeeeeyyyy!
W5C1_70	Don't call me Kammey.
W5C1_85	You see? I was right about the\npipe. If only Master Bowser would\nLISTEN to my ideas...
W5C1_88	I'll go by pipe.
W5C1_134	So this is the place, huh?\nI guess it's pretty colorful...
W5C1_116	Don't you see, Young Master?\nThese sparkling colors are just\nwhat we need to revitalize you!
W5C1_61	\x0e\x03\x03\0I'm gonna soak it up and soak it in...\nNot even sure where to begin...\x0f\x03\x03\x0e\0\x04\0\x0e\x03\x03\0I'll soak all day, and I'll soak all\nnight...if that's what it takes to\nmake it riiiight!\x0f\x03\x03
W5C1_62	Now then—and I say this in the\nmost literal and polite way—kindly\nsoak your head, Young Master!\x0e\0\x04\0And, er, the rest of your body as\nwell. Go on! Don't be shy! Soak up\nas much color as you need.
W5C1_162	I got it, I got it! Watch how\ngood I am at this...
W5C1_66	Told ya! Look how good I look!\x0e\0\x04\0Man, that was easy. Too bad\nit took you guys so long to\nget here!
W5C1_114	...Why are you crying like\nthat, Kamek?
W5C1_67	Oh, Young Master... I'm just so\nhappy that you're back to your\nold self again.\x0e\0\x04\0It hasn't been easy, collaborating\nwith Mario, you know.\x0e\0\x04\0I keep expecting to hear your father\nshout at me at any moment.
W5C1_72	Ooh! Now I can finally get a good\nlook at your face! Let's see...\x0e\0\x04\0You're cute! Such big, round cheeks,\nblack soulless eyes, and those funny\nlittle clown lips... ADORABLE!
W5C1_80	Lady, my face is up HERE!
W5C1_82	Er, yes. I believe you were looking\nat Young Master's clown car, Olivia.\n...Say, that gives me an idea.\x0e\0\x04\0Young Master, mightn't you use\nyour vessel to reach that lightning-\nthrowing monstrosity in the clouds?
W5C1_68	Yeah! Lemme at 'em!\x0e\0\x04\0Lightning doesn't scare me at all.\nLet's go right now! Who says no?\x0e\0\x04\0I'm serious! We can do this right\nnow. Whaddaya say?\x0e\x01\x04\x14\n\0y\0e\0s\0n\0o\0\x01\0\0\0\0\0\0\0
W5C1_69	All right, pile in. But keep your\nfeet off the seat covers or else!\nThey're faux mohair!
W5C1_77	Ah, temper that enthusiasm for\njust a mite longer, Young Master.\x0e\0\x04\0It seems Mario has a few things to\ntake care of before we embark on\nthis stage of our journey.\x0e\0\x04\0Why don't we make our way\nback to Bowser's Castle via\nthe Rinsing Bath?
W5C1_40	Well, well...you're all looking\nrefreshed. That's the Spring\nof Rainbows for you!
W5C1_41	The spring is a natural exfoliant with\nmicrodermal repigmentation bubbles\nand age-defying pore enhancers!
W5C1_42	Did you know that all rainbows in\nthe world are simply light refracting\nthrough the steam of this spring?\x0e\0\x04\0That's according to our marketing\ndepartment, and marketing is a\nform of science, so it must be true.

W5C1_Common_limited1_4	Relax, you've got time.
W5C1_Common_limited2_1	Ooh, is that right?
W5C1_Common_limited2_2	I'm so nervous...
W5C1_Common_limited2_3	Uh-oh...
W5C1_Common_limited2_4	I think he's got this.
W5C1_kurukuru_base1_1	Match it up, Mario!
W5C1_kurukuru_base1_2	Ooh, that hurts my eyes.
W5C1_kurukuru_base1_3	What did it look like before?
W5C1_kurukuru_base1_4	Piece of cake.
W5C1_kurukuru_base1_5	I could do this one.
W5C1_kurukuru_base1_6	This one's tricky.
W5C1_kurukuru_base1_7	I shoulda brought a snack.
W5C1_kurukuru_base1_8	Ooh, this one's hard.
W5C1_kurukuru_base1_9	Umm...wow.
W5C1_kurukuru_limited1_1	Time's running out!
W5C1_kurukuru_limited1_2	Ten seconds left!
W5C1_kurukuru_limited1_3	He's gotta hurry!
W5C1_kurukuru_limited2_1	This doesn't look good...
W5C1_kurukuru_limited2_2	Noooo! C'mon!
W5C1_kurukuru_limited2_3	Five seconds left!
W5C1_kurukuru_limited4_1	What's he doing?
W5C1_kurukuru_limited4_2	He's doing THAT?
W5C1_kurukuru_limited4_3	Now I don't get it.
W5C1_kurukuru_limited5_1	Is that right?
W5C1_kurukuru_limited5_2	One move left!
W5C1_kurukuru_limited5_3	Did that do the trick?
W5C1_kakekko_base1_1	Oh, I blinked.
W5C1_kakekko_base1_2	Who did what now?
W5C1_kakekko_base1_3	Pfft. I woulda won.
W5C1_kakekko_base1_4	And who got first?
W5C1_kakekko_base1_5	All I saw was last.
W5C1_kakekko_base1_6	What a shocker!
W5C1_kakekko_base1_7	I saw the winner.
W5C1_kakekko_base1_8	What? No way!
W5C1_kakekko_base1_9	I have no short-term memory.
W5C1_hakkun_base1_1	Where was it?
W5C1_hakkun_base1_2	This seems fishy.
W5C1_hakkun_base1_3	Oops, I blinked.
W5C1_hakkun_base1_4	I know the answer.
W5C1_hakkun_base1_5	I think it's that one.
W5C1_hakkun_base1_6	I dunno. Those two?
W5C1_hakkun_base1_7	Oh, I forgot already...
W5C1_hakkun_base1_8	It's too hard for me!
W5C1_hakkun_base1_9	I don't get it at all...
W5C1_onsen_base1_1	Wait, is this math?
W5C1_onsen_base1_2	Oof, I'm out.
W5C1_onsen_base1_3	I was told there would be no math!
W5C1_onsen_base1_4	I know the answer.
W5C1_onsen_base1_5	My memory is...not good.
W5C1_onsen_base1_6	I'm really not sure...
W5C1_onsen_base1_7	Uhhhhh...
W5C1_onsen_base1_8	This is tough.
W5C1_onsen_base1_9	I have no idea.
W5C1_onsen_limited8_1	Negatory, good buddy!
W5C1_omoide_base1_1	Ooh, I love this song!
W5C1_omoide_base1_2	I don't know the words...
W5C1_omoide_base1_3	I could hum it...
W5C1_omoide_base1_4	Ooh, I love Sweet Sap!
W5C1_omoide_base1_5	So funky...
W5C1_omoide_base1_6	This is my jam.
W5C1_omoide_base1_7	It's so true...
W5C1_omoide_base1_8	Uhh! Feel the groove!
W5C1_omoide_base1_9	Stylin' and smilin'!
W5C2.msbt
W5C2_1	Wow! Look at the size of that tree!\nWhat kind do you think it is?\nThere's something weird about it...\x0e\0\x04\0Do you think the hot spring is up\nthere? That would be so cool!
W5C2_5	Ooh! The bridge is out. Why are all\nof the bridges broken everywhere?!\x0e\0\x04\0I know something weird is going on\nwith that big tree, but we can't get\nacross to check it out from here.
W5C2_6	Hmm. Do you see that path?\nPerhaps there is another way\nto get there...
W5C2_100	{c[2e7611]}Enjoy a Hard-Won Soak at the...{c[404040]}\n\x0e\x02\0\0 {s[150]}{c[2e7611]}Spring of Jungle Mist {c[404040]}{s[100]}\x0f\x02\0\n\x0e\x02\0\0{c[cf2c12]}↑ Across This Bridge ↑{c[404040]}\x0f\x02\0
W5C2_110	Ooh, it's so lush and tropical in here!
W5C2_131	I expect nothing less from Shangri-\nSpa at this point. They spare no\nexpense for their customers.\x0e\0\x04\0In any case, I suspect that this\nroute may yet help us reach the\nother side of that downed bridge.
W5C2_7	Oh, hrm... It looks like we\nhave a choice to make.
W5C2_8	I think we should go this way!\nCall it my origami sense.
W5C2_10	Is that so? Well, I think we should\ngo this way. Call it Kamek sense.
W5C2_35	It's this way!
W5C2_92	I suspect this way.
W5C2_95	\x0e\x02\0\0{s[120]}Well?{s[100]}\x0f\x02\0
W5C2_190	Do you trust me, Mario?\x0e\x01\x04\x14\n\0y\0e\0s\0n\0o\0\x01\0\0\0\0\0\0\0
W5C2_191	I'm not used to people listening to\nme, so I'll give you another chance\nto back out. Are you sure?\x0e\x01\x04\x14\n\0y\0e\0s\0n\0o\0\x01\0\0\0\0\0\0\0
W5C2_133	Oh! I thought for sure you'd\ngo with Kamek's idea.\x0e\x01\x01\0\x0e\0\x04\0Now I'm kind of worried...\x0e\x01\x01\0but if\nyou thought this way was right,\nmaybe it is!
W5C2_135	A wise decision.\x0e\x01\x01\0\x0e\0\x04\0...\x0e\x01\x01\0Wait, this doesn't feel right. I've\nnever had anyone just take my\nadvice outright. Now I'm nervous!
W5C2_194	You're going that way?
W5C2_195	So be it...
W5C2_160	Did...you guys hear that?\x0e\0\x04\0Was it just my imagination?
W5C2_11	Oh dear. This definitely wasn't\nthe right way.\x0e\0\x04\0Maybe my origami sense was just\ntuned to find the wrong path...
W5C2_15	We have another choice to make.
W5C2_17	Let's see here. Since I was correct\nlast time—and EVERY time, I might\nadd—I assume you will follow me.
W5C2_14	I know Kamek was right last time\nand I was wrong. But I have that\nfunny feeling again about this path!
W5C2_16	Eheeheehee! I assure you that\nthis is the correct way. Have I\nbeen wrong before?
W5C2_137	OK, hear me out. I know I was wrong\nbefore. But I have a super-strong\nfeeling in my folds about this way.\x0e\0\x04\0It's this way! You can count on me.
W5C2_96	C'mon! This way!
W5C2_99	You know it's this way.
W5C2_114	\x0e\x02\0\0{s[120]}Well?!{s[100]}\x0f\x02\0
W5C2_197	You trust me, even though I was\nwrong before?\x0e\x01\x04\x14\n\0y\0e\0s\0n\0o\0\x01\0\0\0\0\0\0\0
W5C2_198	You're going to follow my advice?\nI'm second-guessing myself!\x0e\x01\x04\x14\n\0y\0e\0s\0n\0o\0\x01\0\0\0\0\0\0\0
W5C2_139	\x0e\x01\x01\0\x0e\x01\x03\x04\x01\0\0\0Yay! \nOK, let's go—\x0e\x01\x01\0
W5C2_141	\x0e\x01\x01\0\x0e\x01\x03\x04\x01\0\0\0Very well.\nLet us procee—\x0e\x01\x01\0
W5C2_162	That rustling again! Ooh, it's\nkinda scary...
W5C2_175	What is that noise?! This is my first\ntime in a jungle... Are mysterious\ncrashing noises good?
W5C2_163	I would reassure you, but who will\nreassure me? It's probably just some\nsort of horrifying creature lurking.
W5C2_19	My life just flashed before my eyes!\nI knew we should have taken the\nother path.\x0e\0\x04\0When this is all over, I'm buying\na boat. Call it a midlife crisis if\nyou must.
W5C2_143	I can't believe it... I had such a\nstrong feeling about this path.
W5C2_147	And there's that scary rustling\nin the trees again!\x0e\0\x04\0Oh! Maybe that's why I chose\nthis path!
W5C2_148	Well, at least no one was hurt.\nAnd Kamek's getting a boat!
W5C2_176	Use...the hammer! Press...!
W5C2_22	Hmm. It seems to open up here\nconsiderably. But I don't see any\nsign of a hot spring. Is this the\nend of the path?
W5C2_23	Ha! That's ME! I look pretty sweet,\nlike I'm about to do some kind of\nawesome move in front of Dad.
W5C2_24	My goodness... Finally, some\nrecognition for my years of\nloyal service...\x0e\0\x04\0The memory of this will help me\nget through the next decade of\nthankless toil.
W5C2_144	What was that?!\x0e\0\x04\0Is that what was rustling around\nout here?! WOW, I'm so glad I didn't\nknow it was here the whole time!
W5C2_145	It's some kind of hideous corruption\nof one of Lord Bowser's fiercest and\nmost loyal minions!\x0e\0\x04\0...Bowser would love it. I'll order\nhim a few as a surprise...\x0e\0\x04\0Oh! But, er...yes. We must certainly\navoid this one. We'll be dashed to\nconfetti instantly if it bites us!
W5C2_32	Yet another fork in the road...\nThese Shangri-Spa Toads could\nreally use a groundskeeper to\nadvise them on path manage— OH.
W5C2_25	Three paths this time!\nWhat will we do?
W5C2_27	\x0e\x02\0\0{s[120]}We go this way!{s[100]}\x0f\x02\0
W5C2_28	Now, now, Young Master!\nWe mustn't simply guess.\x0e\0\x04\0We should listen to Kamek, who\nhas been correct every time so far!
W5C2_172	Well...you're not gonna like this,\nbut I have a strong feeling that\nwe should go this way.
W5C2_155	And I assure you it is THIS way!
W5C2_121	Follow me!
W5C2_115	Follow me!
W5C2_118	Follow me!
W5C2_124	\x0e\x02\x01\0Follow me!{/d}\n\x0e\x02\0\0Follow me!\x0f\x02\0\n\x0e\x02\x02\0Follow me!\x0f\x02\x02
W5C2_199	All I have is my instinct, but it says\nto go this way. Do you still believe\nin me, Mario?\x0e\x01\x04\x14\n\0y\0e\0s\0n\0o\0\x01\0\0\0\0\0\0\0
W5C2_200	Lord Bowser always does the\nopposite of what I say. And you\nalways defeat him. It's not a\ncoincidence! You must follow me.\x0e\x01\x04\x14\n\0y\0e\0s\0n\0o\0\x01\0\0\0\0\0\0\0
W5C2_192	That's right! I know how to pick\nthe right path. I've never been\nwrong in my life! You coming?\x0e\x01\x04\x14\n\0y\0e\0s\0n\0o\0\x01\0\0\0\0\0\0\0
W5C2_119	I am vindicated!\n...I mean, let's go.
W5C2_116	Aww, Mario. Thanks for believing\nin me. Let's go!
W5C2_122	Ha! It's like I'm Mario's boss now!
W5C2_203	I get it...
W5C2_204	It's OK... I know I'm right...
W5C2_196	What gives?!
W5C2_123	Unbelievable! I'm so sorry, Mario.\nI was sure I was right each time.
W5C2_142	You see? Feelings are unreliable.\nYou must compress them into a tiny\nball and bind them with logic rope.
W5C2_127	What? No way. This would totally be\nthe right way if it weren't for these\nrocks. Who rigged it against me?!
W5C2_129	If I might, Young Master...\nI told you so.\x0e\0\x04\0Oh! That is delightful.
W5C2_166	Eeee! Look at that terrible thing!\x0e\0\x04\0Actually, I can't even look.\nIt's too scary!
W5C2_167	So this was the source of the\nrustling. My goodness, the mouth\non that thing is indescribable!\x0e\0\x04\0That thing is out of control and\nsure to attack indiscriminately.\nBut I think we're safe for now.
W5C2_178	You see? It's become wedged\nunder that branch. Let's continue\nbefore it becomes...UNwedged.
W5C2_173	Oh no! The monster has loosed\nitself! It could be anywhere!
W5C2_174	Nooo! I can't deal with anything\nthat scary!\x0e\0\x04\0Oh, I wish I were in a hot spring\nalready, just soaking away...
W5C2_40	Finally! We made it across!\nWhat a relief.\x0e\0\x04\0Who's ready for a hot spring and\nhas two triangles for arms? This gal!
W5C2_41	Oh, but before we move on...\nYou were right about which\nway to go every time, Kamek.\x0e\0\x04\0How did you do that?\nIt was amazing!
W5C2_44	Yeah, what gives? You were\ncheating with magic, weren't you!
W5C2_42	Magic, Young Master? Not at all.\x0e\0\x04\0I simply rejected the emotional\nchoices you two made in favor\nof ones made using bloodless logic.\x0e\0\x04\0Yes, my logic-based system—along\nwith timely retreating and tactical\ncowering—have gotten me far.
W5C2_43	But...in a way, doesn't that mean\nI was making the right choice\nevery time?\x0e\0\x04\0You wouldn't have known which\nway to go if I hadn't made the\nwrong choice first!
W5C2_45	Ha! She's got you there!
W5C2_109	Ah, we're here! This is so cool!\x0e\0\x04\0I've seen big trees before—not even\nall that long ago—but this might be\nthe biggest one yet!
W5C2_111	Yes, yes, it's quite impressive.\nBut what do you make of that\nOTHER tree?\x0e\0\x04\0The one with water flowing from\nits base? Wouldn't that be the\nmore logical spot for a hot spring?
W5C2_112	No way! How are we supposed to\nget there? It's almost like they don't\nWANT us to get to the hot spring.
W5C2_113	Well, perhaps we could survey\nthe situation more effectively\nfrom up high.\x0e\0\x04\0Ah, but this ladder is just out\nof reach. Another job for the\nShangri-Spa groundskeeper...
W5C2_120	But YOU'RE the groundskeeper.\nHow are we ever going to reach\nthe ladder, Mr. Groundskeeper?
W5C2_82	Eeee! That scary thing can climb\ntrees! We're not safe anywhere!\x0e\0\x04\0If this is what it takes to get to\nthe hot spring, I'd say this jungle\nisn't very welcoming at all!
W5C2_50	Hey! What's the big idea, running\naway like that?\x0e\0\x04\0You could have warned us at least!
W5C2_51	Er...sorry about that. As I said\nearlier, timely retreats have\nbeen a key to my success.\x0e\0\x04\0Since we are working together\nand you have shouted at me much\nless than my usual coworkers...\nI will try to do better.
W5C2_83	Oh, OK. That was easy!\nMaybe I should be your boss...\nBack to work, Kamek!\nHee! I like that.
W5C2_177	Jump for it! Press !
W5C2_169	I'm sorry, Mario. It was so scary\nthat I just did the thing that\nI told Kamek not to do.
W5C2_170	Eheeheehee! It's easy to act\nwithout thinking when you're\nscared, isn't it?
W5C2_179	But no matter. Our frenzied dash\nand Mario's heroic leap seem to\nhave saved the day. And now,\nat long last, we're here!
W5C2_52	Oh, hello! Welcome!
W5C2_53	You're standing in the fabulous\nSpring of Jungle Mist, known for its\nincredible cleansing properties.\x0e\0\x04\0Unfortunately, right now it's also\nknown for being out of order.\nWe can't find the drain plug!
W5C2_79	Are you... You can't be... I mean...\nWhere do I even start with this?\nFirst, are you aware how difficult\nit is to even REACH this place?\x0e\0\x04\0I resign as groundskeeper, effective\nimmediately! Mario, let's find the\nplug, take the bath, and get out\nof here!
W5C2_105	Hey, don't blame me. I'm not the\ndrain plug's manager. But if I had\nto guess, I'd think it's still on the\nisland somewhere.
W5C2_107	That thing could have hit me!\nThis is a clear workplace-safety\nviolation.
W5C2_101	\x0e\x02\0\0{s[150]}Spring of Jungle Mist{s[100]}\x0f\x02\0\n\x0e\x02\0\0{c[cf2c12]}Effective against Dirt and Spots{c[404040]}\x0f\x02\0
W5C2_164	You guys know where the drain\nplug is?\x0e\0\x04\0I'm pretty sure it's not back here,\nbut I've just got a feeling about\nthis spot, you know?
W5C2_165	You're probably wondering why I\nnever looked up, huh. Well, it's\neasier said than done with a neck\nlike this—lemme tell ya.
W5C2_168	I'm gonna sneak into that hot spring\nas soon as I've got the grass nice\nand smooth. Niiiice and smoooth...
W5C2_58	Oh, thanks for taking care of\nthat. The guy who usually does\nit requires three weeks' notice.\x0e\0\x04\0Now you'll just have to wait for\nthe water to fill up!
W5C2_59	All right... The Spring of Jungle Mist\nis ready for your use! Sorry about...\nwell...everything.
W5C2_61	Finally! Can't wait to get the\nsmudges off my clown car.\nYou think they offer waxing too?
W5C2_60	Young Master! You're spending\nquite a long time under there.\nIs everything all right?
W5C2_62	Ta-daa! How do I look?
W5C2_98	Ah! Terrific! The spring works\nas advertised!\x0e\0\x04\0I was beginning to imagine the\nhorror of returning you to your\nfather in your smudged state...
W5C2_153	Yeah...looking good. Feeling good.\nIt's allllllll good.\x0e\0\x04\0And did I mention how soft my\nfolds are getting? Soooo sofffft...
W5C2_85	Er, yes.\n...Should we consider getting out\nof the hot spring at some point?
W5C2_64	Young Master? Your greens are\nvibrant, and your yellows and\nreds are radiant.\x0e\0\x04\0Let's get a move on, shall we?
W5C2_65	Nah, I like this one. I'm gonna\ntake another dip!
W5C2_80	Young Master! It has been long\nenough! We must get going!
W5C2_84	\n\x0e\x02\0\0{c[ffffff]}{s[150]}You're bleached!{s[100]}{c[404040]}\x0f\x02\0
W5C2_67	Ack! Spooky! I thought I was staring\nat a ghost! All the color drained\nfrom my typeface just now...\x0e\0\x04\0How unfortunate. We worked so\nhard to restore you...yet here you\nstand, reduced to mere line art.
W5C2_81	I don't feel great.\x0e\0\x04\0I don't have the energy to fight...\nor even to complain about not\nhaving the energy to fight...
W5C2_72	I can imagine! Your energy has\nmelted away along with your color.
W5C2_73	This hot spring has been a curse.\nA relaxing, rejuvenating curse that\nhas really opened up my pores!
W5C2_97	And now it seems we're out of\noptions. We've visited all of\nthe springs! How are we going\nto fix you?
W5C2_87	Well, we can't unsoak him, so\nI suppose we'll just have to move on.
W5C2_91	For now, let's make our way to the\nhot springs that will address Young\nMaster's \x0e\x03\0\x04\0\0\0\0 and \x0e\x03\0\x04\x01\0\0\0.
W5C2_93	For now, let's make our way to the\nhot spring that will address Young\nMaster's \x0e\x03\0\x04\0\0\0\0.
W5C2_94	And don't forget the stamp!
W5C2_189	Mario! Did you see what happened\nto Bowser Jr.? Don't go in again—we\nneed you in full color!
W5C2_150	You wanna get off this island?\x0e\x01\x04\x14\n\0y\0e\0s\0n\0o\0\x01\0\0\0\0\0\0\0
W5C2_132	Go take a bath, chief.
W5C2_140	Go get your stamp, chief.
W5C2_146	Hey! You went in the hot spring,\ndidn't you?!
W5C2_149	I didn't go in the hot spring.\nI just tan in reverse!
W5C2_151	OK. Up we go. And if anyone asks,\nI haven't set foot in that hot spring.\nWouldn't dream of it.
W5C3.msbt
W5C3_2	Mario, we must proceed farther\ninto the castle. Lord Bowser is\nlikely on the second floor!
W5C3_207	We should watch our step.\nThe castle is certain to be infested\nwith Folded Soldiers by now.\x0e\0\x04\0They'll likely have scouted all\nmanner of clever hiding spots from\nwhich to spring out and attack!\nBe on your guard...
W5C3_75	The audacity!\x0e\0\x04\0Gathering for some sort of feast\nout in the open—and using Lord\nBowser's finest china no less!
W5C3_200	Ooh, a feast does sound good\nafter all of that soaking...
W5C3_84	I don't care about food or Dad's\nfine china. I'm just gonna go\nrescue him!
W5C3_198	Daaad!
W5C3_211	Oh, look! The green streamer winds\nup to the second floor somewhere.
W5C3_199	Attention, Folded Soldiers!\nCease this feast at once!\x0e\0\x04\0Fold your napkins, and kindly\nbus your own table!
W5C3_72	Oh. There sure are a lot of\nthem, huh.\x0e\0\x04\0Perhaps I should have thought\nthis out a bit more.
W5C3_165	Yaaah!
W5C3_166	Charge!
W5C3_167	Get 'em!
W5C3_14	We're saved! Thank goodness I had\nthe foresight to rally these minions.
W5C3_34	Now, while they're distracted, let's\ntry to catch up with the Young\nMaster before he's overwhelmed.
W5C3_6	We can't leave without helping\nLord Bowser!
W5C3_186	Help me!
W5C3_188	You ain't so tough!
W5C3_189	Shells don't fold!
W5C3_262	I don't like you, but I respect you.
W5C3_263	Couldn't have done it without you.
W5C3_264	I'll admit it. You saved me.
W5C3_265	Thanks, hammer bro!
W5C3_266	You're good. Real good.
W5C3_267	They're so edgy...
W5C3_268	They don't fold easy... Wait...
W5C3_269	I can do this! Probably!
W5C3_270	Who's next?
W5C3_271	OK, I'm a little freaked out.
W5C3_272	Do we get overtime for this?
W5C3_273	Oh, come ON!
W5C3_274	Yikes!
W5C3_275	I need a nap.
W5C3_276	I got stomped...
W5C3_277	I'm gonna take a nap.
W5C3_278	I can hammer all day, bro.
W5C3_279	It's bro time!
W5C3_280	I'll flatten 'em!
W5C3_281	I'll fold 'em without instructions!
W5C3_7	What's with this stupid door?\nIt won't open!\x0e\0\x04\0Kamek! You must have a key. Gimme!
W5C3_8	I believe I do have a spare...but\nnot on my person at the moment.\nI keep it in my quarters.
W5C3_35	We'll need to make our way back\ndownstairs, through the door to\nthe right of the great room. Come!
W5C3_56	What are you waiting for?\nGo get the key, Mario!
W5C3_16	Please! Lead the way, Mario.\nDownstairs, through the door\non the right.
W5C3_9	I assure you that my quarters are\ntidy enough for visitors. We must\ngo through the door on the right\nto get to them!
W5C3_19	Ugh, what a mess!\x0e\0\x04\0My room is on the other side of\nthis rubble. We'll need to figure\nout a way to get past it...
W5C3_180	We still need to retrieve the key\nfrom my quarters, remember?
W5C3_289	Mario, we need to get to Kamek's\nquarters for the key!
W5C3_204	This is a pretty big mess.\nI wish I could help somehow!\x0e\0\x04\0Maybe...just maybe...this is the\ntime for a tiny origami girl to\nshow her strength!
W5C3_206	...Or maybe not.
W5C3_10	Allow me, Olivia. I have something\nhere that may be of some use...
W5C3_85	Kaaa!
W5C3_107	Wow! That was amazing!\x0e\0\x04\0You'll make a great groundskeeper\nyet, Kamek!
W5C3_102	Eheeheehee. You see? I'm not all\ntactical cowering. I can do some\nthings when I have my wand.\x0e\0\x04\0Now, follow me!
W5C3_11	Stand back! I will again demonstrate\nmy powers. This is nothing for the\ngreat wizard Kamek!
W5C3_103	Wow, you did it again!\nThat's so cool!
W5C3_12	Eheeheehee! What did I tell you?\nCome now, quickly!
W5C3_58	Eep.
W5C3_13	Kamek sure is feeling himself!\n...Where did he go, though?
W5C3_83	Eww...I don't like it in here one bit.\nLet's hurry up and find Kamek's\nroom so we can get out of here.
W5C3_15	Ohhh...
W5C3_17	Eep! Someone's in there, Mario!\nI can hear them moaning like a\nghost. Maybe it IS a ghost!\x0e\0\x04\0I don't think I can meet a ghost\nright now. Maybe another time,\nover coffee...\x0e\0\x04\0I'll just wait out here, OK?\nPlease get the key!
W5C3_20	...yeahhhhh...
W5C3_22	OH YEAH!\x0e\0\x04\0This smells amazing... Makes me\nwanna cook a pizza. Or pasta?\nMaybe a pizza pasta...
W5C3_23	Mario! Good timing! I found a Shiny\nMushroom.\x0e\0\x04\0Oh! And the key to Peach's Castle!
W5C3_65	...Kinda weird that it was in\nBowser's Castle, I guess...
W5C3_24	No! It's the wrong key again?!\nI'm so sorry, Bro.
W5C3_28	You gotta admit—I'm getting closer!\nThis time it's the key to a castle\nat least!
W5C3_29	I won't give up! The key to Peach's\nCastle is out there, and I'm-a\ngonna find it!
W5C3_25	You're back! Did you see Luigi?\nHe just sprinted out of there\nlike HE saw a ghost!\x0e\0\x04\0Anyway, did you find the key?\nAlso, because I'm curious...what\nwas Kamek's room like?
W5C3_21	The key!
W5C3_80	Oh, Mario... That was awful...
W5C3_209	I was so scared! And you just\nrushed in to save me...like you've\ndone so many times now...\x0e\0\x04\0And all I could do was be as quiet\nas a mouse so you wouldn't let up\nwith those mighty hammer swings.
W5C3_210	Sorry about that. I guess I got\na little carried away.\x0e\0\x04\0I hope my tears didn't leave little\nsoggy spots on your overalls.
W5C3_213	You know what? I'm better now.\nI think I cried it all out!\x0e\0\x04\0Let's go take care of the green\nstreamer. I think we're almost\nready to take on my brother!
W5C3_214	Let's do it for the confetti that\nused to be Bowser's minions.\nWe'll make that confetti proud!
W5C3_212	There it is! The end of the\ngreen streamer!\x0e\0\x04\0We did it! \x0e\x01\x01\0It's the end of the road!\nThe last of the streamers!
W5C3_45	Hey! I'm here too!
W5C3_175	\x0e\x02\0\0{s[150]}Look out!{s[100]}\x0f\x02\0
W5C3_176	I get credit for that!
W5C3_123	Hmph. Well dodged.\x0e\0\x04\0Of course, I expect nothing less.\nIt would have been terribly boring\nto end things so quickly, yes?\x0e\0\x04\0Why don't you warm up a bit?\nI'll send out my new pet for\nyou to play with.
W5C3_124	And yet, you must face it.\x0e\0\x04\0Have fun! I'll be waiting if\nyou happen to survive.
W5C3_27	...Oh my gosh...\nDid those Scissors make that...\nTHING...out of people's FACES?!\x0e\x01\x01\0\x0e\0\x04\0I can hardly even look at it!\nHow monstrous!
W5C3_41	Help us!
W5C3_208	Can you hit those flying heads?\x0e\x01\0\x04\x88\x13\0\0
W5C3_290	I think it's peeling off!\x0e\x01\0\x04\x88\x13\0\0
W5C3_295	The hammer isn't working?!\x0e\x01\0\x04\x88\x13\0\0
W5C3_125	Mario! It's me! Kamek!\x0e\0\x04\0This monstrosity has hijacked\nmy magical abilities.
W5C3_126	Watch out! He's charging up\nan extremely powerful spell...\x0e\0\x04\0If you could just remove my face,\nit should significantly weaken\nthis...this paper mistake!\x0e\0\x04\0Try to dodge the attack and\nthen peel my face off. Yes, I know\nit sounds ridiculous! Just do it!
W5C3_247	So we need to peel off Kamek's face?\x0e\x01\0\x04\x88\x13\0\0
W5C3_294	Just a bit more...\x0e\x01\0\x04\x88\x13\0\0
W5C3_291	Yes! Now, come on!
W5C3_292	Hurry! Hurry!
W5C3_293	Over here! C'mon!
W5C3_128	You've done it! Now it's just an\nordinary giant Buzzy Beetle with\nslightly less-devastating attacks.\x0e\0\x04\0Finish it off quickly, will you?
W5C3_129	Is that Mario?
W5C3_130	Where am I?
W5C3_131	I'm hungry...
W5C3_132	Hey! Stop touching my face!
W5C3_133	Who didn't brush their teeth?!
W5C3_134	Eww! Is that a tongue?
W5C3_MPT_101204	I'm saved!
W5C3_MPT_101205	Hooray!
W5C3_MPT_101206	Thank you!
W5C3_MPT_101207	I guess this is better...
W5C3_MPT_101208	Now what?
W5C3_135	You can't use that here for some reason!
W5C3_52	Hey! Mario!
W5C3_57	Don't forget about the scissors!
W5C3_51	I suppose any toy made out of\nthe faces of those pathetic\nminions was bound to be flimsy.\x0e\0\x04\0No matter. I trust you've\nwarmed up? En garde!
W5C3_187	Mario! We haven't done anything\nabout the green streamer yet!
W5C3_36	How about THAT! Had enough?!\x0e\0\x04\0That'll teach you to underestimate\nmy friend Mario!\x0e\0\x04\0Huh?!
W5C3_232	Yes!
W5C3_233	My body!
W5C3_234	Thank you!
W5C3_235	You did it, Mario! I'm fully restored,\nand I even managed to hang on\nto my wand.
W5C3_241	Yeah! Not bad! I guess some of the\nthings Dad says about you being\ntiny and stupid aren't true.
W5C3_31	Now all we have to do is release\nthe green streamer.\x0e\0\x04\0Let's take care of it the way we\nalways do...with a big smack!
W5C3_79	Hey! That green thing is still messing\nup my castle!
W5C3_62	Can you please take care of the\ngreen streamer? It's the last one!
W5C3_120	Did you know that scissors are\nthe natural enemy of flat paper\nAND origami? It's fascinating...
W5C3_242	I'm glad you broke those dumb\nscissors. They're the same ones\nthat cut me all up!
W5C3_32	Great job as usual, Mario.\nThat was the last streamer.\nWe've done it!
W5C3_236	Thank you all so much for\nhelping me...
W5C3_220	You know, ever since you first\nsaved me from that wall in\nPeach's Castle...\x0e\0\x04\0You've just been saving me over\nand over again!
W5C3_253	So, from the bottom of my heart,\nI want to thank you, Mario.\x0e\0\x04\0I truly couldn't have done any\nof this without you.\x0e\0\x04\0I...I wouldn't have amounted\nto anything...
W5C3_237	...Are you OK, Olivia?
W5C3_238	...Yes. I'm just so happy that we\ncan get to Peach's Castle now...
W5C3_239	But I wonder if I'll be able to stop\nmy brother.\x0e\0\x04\0Could I do something that\nimportant on my own?
W5C3_224	Hey! Origami girl!
W5C3_257	You didn't think we were going\nto let you do that alone, did you?
W5C3_249	Don't you know how this works?\nMario needs to rescue the princess...\nand I need to find Olly and punchify\nhis face for making me like this!\x0e\0\x04\0...Or at least flap aggressively\nat him until I can get my body\nback together. GRAAH!
W5C3_240	Yeah! I'm gonna get him for what\nhe did to my Dad too.\x0e\0\x04\0AND for everything I'VE been\nthrough. Like, about 40 baths,\nand getting cut into pieces... Ugh!
W5C3_221	Eheeheehee! That's the spirit!\x0e\0\x04\0Let's show them the power of\nBowser's minions...and flat paper!
W5C3_222	Oh, you guys! Thank you!\x0e\0\x04\0With all of you by my side, I might\nactually be able to do this!
W5C3_288	\x0e\x02\0\0{s[150]}Lemme at him!{s[100]}\x0f\x02\0
W5C3_250	I'm coming for you, Brother. And this\ntime it won't be so easy to drop a\ngiant boulder on me!
W5C3_223	Oh, by the way... How are we\nactually going to get to\nPeach's Castle, you guys?
W5C3_225	Bwahaha!\x0e\0\x04\0Don't worry about that part.\nLord Bowser has you covered.\x0e\0\x04\0But, there is one thing you'll\nneed to do...
W5C3_226	\x0e\x02\0\0{s[150]}Get me down already!{s[100]}\x0f\x02\0
W5C3_246	Hurry up!
W5C3_195	Ow!
W5C3_229	All together!
W5C3_230	I'm trying!
W5C3_231	Pull, now!
W5C3_245	Rrrrrrgh!
W5C3_59	That's better! Sort of.
W5C3_258	So, Mr. Bowser... What's your\nplan for getting to the castle?\nIt's on top of a volcano, you see...
W5C3_259	Ahem...about the plan for reaching\nPeach's Castle... Perhaps we should\nhave a brief chat, milord...
W5C3_70	Bwahaha! No time to listen.\nI have just the thing for\nsuch an excursion.
W5C3_217	Mario! Origami girl! I must prepare\na few things. Follow me! To the\nsupply closet!\x0e\0\x04\0...It's on the first floor.
W5C3_66	Ooh, I bet Dad has some kind of\nwicked, sweet new toy...
W5C3_67	I'm not sure what Lord Bowser has\nin mind. Nor am I sure he is aware of\nthe extent of the castle's damage.\x0e\0\x04\0Please don't tell him I'm the\none who crashed it.
W5C3_100	You did it, man! First paper to\never defeat scissors.\x0e\0\x04\0They're gonna write a book about\nit, and then probably a movie that\neveryone will hate.
W5C3_86	So...this still isn't over? I knew\nI should have gone to college...
W5C3_88	Lord Bowser asked me to relay\na short message:\x0e\0\x04\0"Hurry up and get to the supply\ncloset! You're letting a guy who's\nwalking with his face walk faster\nthan you!"
W5C3_89	The room you're looking for is\non the first floor on the left.
W5C3_95	Origami doesn't scare me anymore.\nIt's just folded paper!
W5C3_94	If I've learned anything from Mario,\nit's that hitting things with a\nhammer will solve all of my problems.
W5C3_92	I just know there's gonna be a huge\nbattle soon. I mean, a HUGER battle.\nMore huge? Anyway, it'll be big.
W5C3_93	We can't let that origami dude\nget away with this. We won't\nfold the knee!
W5C3_91	We should probably clean up the\nplace before Bowser gets unfolded\nand realizes how messy it is...
W5C3_90	Lord Bowser awaits you!
W5C3_53	Ah, Mario! Welcome.\x0e\0\x04\0This is merely a supply closet, but\nwait until you see what is on the\nother side of that door...
W5C3_215	Normally I wouldn't allow you\ninside these confidential areas,\nof course.\x0e\0\x04\0That's why I had this security\nsystem installed. No one gets in\nunless I say so!\x0e\0\x04\0To unlock the door, you'll have\nto...um...do something with those\npillars. It definitely involves pillars!\x0e\0\x04\0Do something with the pillars, and\nhurry up with it!
W5C3_82	Yes...hitting the pillars sure does\ndo something...
W5C3_76	Bwahaha! I should have known\nyou'd figure it out. Time to get\na refund from my security guy.\x0e\0\x04\0Anyway, follow me.
W5C3_38	Can you believe that Lord Bowser\nbanned me from piloting the\nclown car again?\x0e\0\x04\0I mean, whaddaya expect?\nPutting me out there without\nthe proper training.\x0e\0\x04\0Not even a thank-you for saving\nhim back at Peach's Castle. Hmph.
W5C3_243	Wow! This is... It's...
W5C3_260	It's really something!\n...What is it we're looking at?
W5C3_244	Patience, origami.\x0e\0\x04\0Now, Mario...I've got one more\njob for you. Come!
W5C3_106	Push the button on the left and\nall of our problems will be solved.\x0e\0\x04\0Do it!
W5C3_77	\x0e\x02\0\0{s[150]}{c[cf2c12]}Cut Engines{c[404040]}{s[100]}\x0f\x02\0\n\x0e\x02\x02\0{s[050]}is the button on the right. →{s[100]}\x0f\x02\x02
W5C3_78	\x0e\x02\0\0{s[150]}{c[cf2c12]}Secret Weapon{c[404040]}{s[100]}\x0f\x02\0\n\x0e\x02\x01\0{s[050]}← is the button on the left.{s[100]}{/d}
W5C3_71	Can you believe someone pushed\nthe button on the right once?\nIf I ever find out who did it...
W5C3_227	Bwahaha! Behold my latest\nand greatest airship!
W5C3_251	It's really nice! And you say this\nthing flies?
W5C3_202	Whaddaya think, Mario?\nWe probably woulda used\nthis against you!\x0e\0\x04\0Maybe we still will. Don't look\naround too much when you're\non board!
W5C3_252	Oh! Are you the groundskeeper\nfor the airship too?
W5C3_201	What? No! This is a magic broom.\nIt's not for sweeping.\x0e\0\x04\0Although...I do already see a few\ndusty areas that could use some\nattention. Excuse me...
W5C3_73	Checking in for duty, ma'am.
W5C3_40	Bobby?! Is that you? How?!
W5C3_42	What's happening?!\nAm I seeing things?\x0e\0\x04\0How are there so many Bobbys?!
W5C3_81	But I thought Bobby was gone...\nafter he saved my life with that\nbig kaboom...
W5C3_43	Do you have me confused with\nanother Bob-omb? It's OK—it\nhappens all the time.\x0e\0\x04\0We do our jobs, and when we're\ndone, there's always another\nBob-omb there to take our place.\x0e\0\x04\0All any of us can hope for is to\nmake an impact...ma'am.
W5C3_46	I suppose...if you say so.
W5C3_256	You know what? I'm not going to\nthink too hard about this. It's just\nnice to see you again, Bobby.\x0e\0\x04\0...And thank you.
W5C3_47	All aboard! We storm Peach's\nCastle in five!
W5C3_228	You two! Do whatever you need\nto do to prepare yourselves. I'm\ntold some antinausea medicine\nmay be in order.
W5C3_105	You're ready to go?\x0e\x01\x04\x14\n\0y\0e\0s\0n\0o\0\x01\0\0\0\0\0\0\0
W5C3_49	What's the holdup? Do you even\nWANT to rescue the princess?
W5C3_50	All right! Listen up, everyone.\x0e\0\x04\0\x0e\x01\x01\0Start the engines!
W5C3_301	Start the engines!
W5C3_261	Start the engines!
W5C3_108	Bwahaha! Here we go! Aim\ndirectly for the top of the\nvolcano. Oh, and...
W5C3_299	\x0e\x02\0\0{s[150]}Punch it!{s[100]}\x0f\x02\0
W5C3_303	This is amazing! I can't believe this\nheavy boat can fly through the air.\x0e\0\x04\0I have to work pretty hard to float\njust a little bit. And this thing is\nHUGE! It's very you, Bowser.
W5C3_304	Bwahaha! I'm glad you like it. They\ntell me it's the most powerful and\nleast efficient vehicle ever produced.\x0e\0\x04\0I'd show you around more, but\nwe're almost there. Can this\nbad boy move or what?!
W5C3_110	Lord Bowser! Enemies spotted!\nRight ahead!
W5C3_111	So what? You think those are\ndecorative cannons we got here?\nLoad 'em up and open fire!
W5C3_184	Bwahaha! That was easy.\nDidn't even scratch the paint!
W5C3_185	Milord! There are more of them!
W5C3_183	Bah! Don't know when to quit,\ndo they?\x0e\0\x04\0Mario! You wanna make yourself\nuseful for once? Follow me!
W5C3_296	You're gonna fire the big gun.\nDon't mess it up!\x0e\0\x04\0Now, there are two ways to do this.\nYou gonna use {c[cf2c12]}motion controls {c[404040]}or\nthe {c[cf2c12]}Left Stick{c[404040]}?\x0e\x01\x04\x1a\x10\0W\05\0C\03\0_\02\09\07\0\xff\xff\xff\xff\0\0\0\0
W5C3_297	Motion controls\nLeft Stick
W5C3_298	All right! Get ready...
W5C3_shooting_002	Here's how it works!
W5C3_shooting_003	Tilt the  to aim! Press  to blast\nyour enemies! It's that simple.\x0e\0\x04\0Don't even think about accessing\nthe menu right now! You've got a\ncannon to fire. Don't mess this up!
W5C3_shooting_003_KeyOnly	Move  to aim! Press  to blast\nyour enemies! It's that simple.\x0e\0\x04\0Don't even think about accessing\nthe menu right now! You've got a\ncannon to fire. Don't mess this up!
W5C3_shooting_004	\x0e\x02\0\0{s[150]}Light 'em up!{s[100]}\x0f\x02\0
W5C3_shooting_200	They're relentless!
W5C3_shooting_201	Perfect!
W5C3_shooting_203	One after another...
W5C3_shooting_204	Hey! What's that?
W5C3_shooting_205	I'll investigate...
W5C3_shooting_400	Save me!
W5C3_shooting_402	They're gonna get me...
W5C3_shooting_403	Hooray!
W5C3_shooting_404	I'm saved!
W5C3_shooting_401	I thought I was done for.\nThanks for saving my shell!
W5C3_shooting_401_down	That was close! But I live to\nparatroop another day...
W5C3_shooting_104	\x0e\x02\0\0{s[150]}Incoming! More of 'em!{s[100]}\x0f\x02\0
W5C3_shooting_300	Wait!
W5C3_shooting_301	Ha! Nice one.
W5C3_shooting_303	Is that it?
W5C3_shooting_206	No, look down there!
W5C3_shooting_304	What is that?!
W5C3_shooting_207	It must be the boss!
W5C3_shooting_208	It's quite impressive.
W5C3_shooting_305	Trash that thing, Mario!
W5C3_shooting_213	We're in your hands.
W5C3_shooting_214	Young Master! We must flee!
W5C3_shooting_306	Uh...good luck!
W5C3_shooting_210	Is it destroyed?
W5C3_shooting_307	Crushed it! Haha!
W5C3_shooting_215	No, it's headed straight for us!
W5C3_shooting_211	Keep firing, Mario!
W5C3_shooting_216	It's been an honor...
W5C3_shooting_309	No! I never lose!
W5C3_shooting_308	You did it!
W5C3_shooting_212	Finally. It's over.
W5C3_shooting_302	Dad's airship did most of it.\nJust sayin'.
W5C3_shooting_202	Come now! Mario performed more\nthan adequately.
W5C3_shooting_P_KPAJ_damage_001	Hey! Watch it!
W5C3_shooting_P_KPAJ_damage_002	That stings!
W5C3_shooting_P_KPAJ_damage_003	Unfriendly fire!
W5C3_shooting_P_KPAJ_damage_004	Don't shoot me!
W5C3_shooting_P_KPAJ_damage_005	Knock it off!
W5C3_shooting_P_PAT_damage_001	Ow!
W5C3_shooting_P_PAT_damage_002	Was that you?!
W5C3_shooting_P_PAT_damage_003	Nooooo...
W5C3_shooting_P_PAT_damage_004	Don't aim at ME!
W5C3_shooting_P_PAT_damage_005	Oof.
W5C3_shooting_P_KMK_damage_001	Ack!
W5C3_shooting_P_KMK_damage_002	KAAH!
W5C3_shooting_P_KMK_damage_003	Don't shoot ME!
W5C3_shooting_P_KMK_damage_004	Over there! There!
W5C3_shooting_P_KMK_damage_005	Open your eyes!

W5C3_114	Nice work, Mario. You're our hero!\nAnd that explosion those Bobbys\ndid was amazing too!
W5C3_115	Yes, yes...let's not get carried\naway. The airship really did\nall of the heavy lifting.
W5C3_118	Peach's Castle in sight!\nBegin final approach!

W5C3_96	We're holding down the fort.\nHow's the battle going?
W5C3_97	Don't worry—we'll have this place\nclean before Lord Bowser returns,\nor else we'll clean it later!
W5C3_117	Ugh...I can't believe they left me\nbehind. After everything I've done...\x0e\0\x04\0I was so excited about the airship\nthat I bought this. Now I don't\neven want it anymore. You take it.
W5C3_119	They're probably all flying around,\nfree as birds...

W5G1_163	What is this place? Where are we?\x0e\0\x04\0It seems like we're up pretty high,\nbut it's too cloudy to see much.
W5G1_164	Hey! There's the green streamer!\x0e\0\x04\0It just kind of...trails off into the\nclouds. Should we try to see where\nit leads?

W5G1_124	Oh, yes! We found paradise!\x0e\0\x04\0...Do you know what that means?\nBecause I don't, but I'm excited.\nIt just sounds good!
W5G1_3	Welcome! Welcome to Shangri-Spa!
W5G1_1	Shangri-Spa? That sounds amazing!
W5G1_2	...What does it mean?\x0e\0\x04\0Shangriiii...kinda sounds like angry!\nBut these Toads don't look angry.\nThey're almost...TOO calm. It sure\nis mysterious.
W5G1_13	You are always welcome in\nShangri-Spa.
W5G1_14	Did you get the special prize for\nvisiting all of the Toad statues in\nthe Great Sea? I want to see it!
W5G1_125	Seek and ye shall find...\nCome, follow me to\nparadise...
W5G1_126	Someone at the front desk will\nbe blessed to assist you.
W5G1_128	Our first customer in what feels\nlike eons, and it's Mario?! This\nis a blessed day!
W5G1_129	I just knew you'd clear the three\ntrials and join us today. I also\npredict you will enjoy yourself!
W5G1_130	Did you enjoy the trials you passed\nto get here? Ooh, I hope so! We just\nwant you to arrive pre-entertained!
W5G1_131	Ooh! No one ever talks to me.\nUm...what do I say? There's too\nmuch pressure!\x0e\0\x04\0Uh...enspa your joy!\x0e\0\x04\0No! I BLEW IT!
W5G1_134	To return to the less-relaxing-but-\nmore-real world, please use the\npipe beyond this door.
W5G1_298	Hey, look at that, Mario. It's a\nSuper Marino toy!
W5G1_173	Toy? Super Marino? Not at all!\x0e\0\x04\0This is a replica of the Spa Marino,\na submarine we use to escort our\nguests to the Diamond Island trials.\x0e\0\x04\0I actually have quite a lot more\nto say about it. Do you want to\nhear its fascinating history?\x0e\x01\x04\x14\n\0y\0e\0s\0n\0o\0\x01\0\0\0\0\0\0\0
W5G1_174	Oh, good! I love telling this story.\nSo, according to legend, our little\nSpa Marino was once stolen by\nthe mythical Khap'taan Teeowed.\x0e\0\x04\0As a sort of ransom, he offered the\nsub back to King Shroomses...in\nexchange for the king's crown!\x0e\0\x04\0Well, that didn't sit well with King\nShroomses, a major spa enthusiast\nand Shangri-Spa's most generous\ntipper. He...also liked being king.\x0e\0\x04\0So King Shroomses arranged to have\nKhap'taan Teeowed captured and\nfrozen in a block of ice. What a\nstory, right?
W5G1_177	Wow...really?
W5G1_179	Being stuck in a deep freeze must\nhave made Captain T. Ode less of a\nhothead. He seemed nice! Definitely\nnot a king toppler, y'know?
W5G1_299	The Spa Marino is actually a\nfunctional submarine we use to\nescort guests to Diamond Island.\x0e\0\x04\0Do you want to hear its\nfascinating history?\x0e\x01\x04\x14\n\0y\0e\0s\0n\0o\0\x01\0\0\0\0\0\0\0
W5G1_333	Hey...that seems familiar!
W5G1_334	Ah, are you familiar with the\nAncient Ones of the Scorching\nSandpaper Desert?\x0e\0\x04\0Yes, in fact, our services here at\nShangri-Spa date back even to\nthose ancient times.\x0e\0\x04\0It is said that King Shroomses himself\nwas a frequent visitor. Liked his\ntowels prewarmed, if I recall.\x0e\0\x04\0In any case, this relief was a gift\nfrom his kingdom. Thank you for\nasking me about it!

W5G1_4	I'm sorry, sir. You'll need to check\nin at the front desk and pay a\nmandatory suggested donation first.
W5G1_217	Welcome to Shangri-Spa, Mario.\x0e\0\x04\0We're a place for you to rest,\nreflect, and be renewed through\nthe power of hot springs.
W5G1_218	Hooray! Sign me up! My mind and\nbody could use all of those things.
W5G1_5	The suggested donation for\nadmission is 1,000 coins, and\nit is mandatory. Might I suggest\nyou make that donation now?\x0e\x01\x04\x14\n\0y\0e\0s\0n\0o\0\x01\0\0\0\0\0\0\0
W5G1_8	Oh, I'm terribly sorry, but it\ndoesn't seem as though you\nhave enough coins.
W5G1_12	Eeee! I can't wait to be refreshed!\nAND renewed! I don't know which\none I'm looking forward to more!
W5G1_9	Thank you so much! I hope you\nenjoy our services.\x0e\0\x04\0Oh! Just one last thing before you\ngo. We've started a successive-\nsoaker campaign!\x0e\0\x04\0Please take this stamp card with\nyou as you visit our hot springs.
W5G1_10	If you collect stamps from each of\nour hot springs, we'll give you a\nspecial prize!\x0e\0\x04\0Just remember to get your card\nstamped each time, and then bring\nit back to me when you're done.\x0e\0\x04\0That's it from me. I hope you\nenjoy Shangri-Spa!
W5G1_219	Yay! I've been looking forward to\nlooking forward to something!
W5G1_133	Oh! Well, if you change your mind,\nShangri-Spa will be waiting.
W5G1_16	Ah, welcome back. Did you manage\nto fill out your stamp card?\nLet's take a look.\x0e\x01\x04\x18\x0e\0K\0e\0y\0I\0t\0e\0m\0\x01\0\0\0\0\0\0\0
W5G1_19	That's not one of our stamp cards,\nI'm afraid.
W5G1_25	Ooh. It doesn't look like you've\ncollected all of the stamps yet.
W5G1_144	Congratulations! You've done it!\x0e\0\x04\0For some reason, many of our\nclients seem to have a hard time\nmaking it to all four of our springs.\x0e\0\x04\0No matter. Without further delay,\nallow me to present you with\nyour reward.
W5G1_184	Um...what? What is that?!\x0e\0\x04\0I don't mean to be ungrateful, but\nwe had to try pretty hard to visit\nall of the hot springs, and that's\njust...a piece of paper?
W5G1_294	That's no mere piece of paper,\nfriend. That is a VIP pass to our\nmost exclusive hot spring.\nThe Spring of Rainbows!\x0e\0\x04\0The restorative effects of the\nSpring of Rainbows are the stuff\nof legend.\x0e\0\x04\0Ah, but there's no need for me to\nprattle on about color restoration\nand palette cleansing...\x0e\0\x04\0You can experience these effects\nand more for yourself!
W5G1_296	Do you hear that, Young Master?\nThat could be just the thing to\nrestore your vibrant colors!
W5G1_383	And my anger! I can't wait to\nget angry again!
W5G1_365	Now, as our most exclusive spring,\nthe Spring of Rainbows is not as\neasy to find as some of our others.\x0e\0\x04\0In fact, I'm not even going to tell\nyou where it is. That's all part\nof the fun!
W5G1_366	Well, when you put it that way...\nI guess it does sound fun!\x0e\0\x04\0I love a good mystery, especially\none that ends with a soak in an\namazing secret hot spring...
W5G1_368	Hey, there goes the anger already!\nI'm tired of being all faded.\nI'm gonna find this thing right away!
W5G1_145	The naturally occurring chemical\nprocesses at work within the\nSpring of Rainbows are 100 percent\nguaranteed to restore color.\x0e\0\x04\0I am legally prohibited from saying\nanything more or describing the\nspring's actual location.
W5G1_146	Welcome back! I trust you had a\nrelaxing time at Shangri-Spa? We \nhope to see you again sometime.
W5G1_228	What is that coming off of the\nwater, Mario? Smoke? Maybe we\nshould take a look.
W5G1_272	It sure looks hot... Do you think\nthis is one of the hot springs?\n...It doesn't look very springy.
W5G1_253	You're so brave, Mario! You just\njumped right in with no regard\nfor your own crispness!
W5G1_254	And it seems like you're...fine.\nMaybe even better than fine.\x0e\0\x04\0But what will happen to me?\nWill I get soggy?\x0e\0\x04\0My heart's pounding, but I guess\nthere's only one way to find out...
W5G1_229	\x0e\x01\x03\x04\x02\0\0\0\x0e\x03\x01\x04\x9a\x99\x99>Ohhhhh...\x0f\x03\x01\x0e\0\x04\0\x0e\x03\x01\x04\x9a\x99\x99>Yeah, I get it now.\x0f\x03\x01\x0e\0\x04\0\x0e\x03\x01\x04\x9a\x99\x99>Just gonna...bliss out for\na while... Don't mind me.\x0f\x03\x01
W5G1_230	It feels SO good...\x0e\0\x04\0So this is what they meant by\nrefreshing and renewing your\nmind and body.\x0e\0\x04\0Bad news, Mario. I only care about\nhot springs now. Ahhh...

W5G1_138	How's the temp? I don't wanna\ncook in my own shell...
W5G1_137	Why...you're one of Bowser's\nminions, aren't you? It's awfully\nnice of him to let you take a spa\nvacation like this!
W5G1_200	Whoa...this view is incredible!\nWe're actually floating in the\nclouds, Mario!\x0e\0\x04\0It's so nice I could almost forget\nabout the green streamer.\x0e\0\x04\0Oh, darn...I just remembered it.\nAnd now it's...hmm?
W5G1_227	What is that horrible scary face\ndoing here?\x0e\0\x04\0Do you think it's part of the spa?\nIt's not renewing my mind OR body!
W5G1_201	Maybe we should ask someone.\nLike this groundskeeper!\x0e\0\x04\0Excuse us, groundskeeper!\nCan you help us?
W5G1_23	Mario?! What are you doing here?
W5G1_21	Sometimes I forget you're a\ncelebrity. Or...do you actually\nknow this groundskeeper?
W5G1_140	Groundskeeper? I'll have you know...\nAh, it's not important.\x0e\0\x04\0As Lord Bowser's number one, I\nhave faced off against this\nmeddling mustachioed marauder\nmore times than I can count!
W5G1_347	You may have heard of me.\nI am known as Kamek!
W5G1_182	Oh! Pleased to meet you. My name's\nOlivia, and Mario and I are both\ntraveling around a bit and trying\nto stop my brother's evil plan.\x0e\0\x04\0I'm sorry that I haven't heard of\nyou, Mr. Kamek. But it's very\nimpressive that you're Bowser's \nnumber-one groundskeeper!
W5G1_183	No, that's not... I'm not...\nLook, the work I do for Bowser...\x0e\0\x04\0*sigh* Thank you.\x0e\0\x04\0As Lord Bowser's number one...\ngroundskeeper...I have some\nimportant information for you.
W5G1_94	After escaping in the clown car,\nLord Bowser returned to his castle,\nwhere I awaited his command.
W5G1_96	But just as he arrived, we were\noverwhelmed by Folded Soldiers.\nBowser was captured. Again.
W5G1_97	Having heroically secreted myself\nduring the attack, I was ready to\nengage our emergency protocol.
W5G1_98	But the button I pressed shut off\nthe airship's engines instead.\nIt wasn't my fault!
W5G1_99	With the engines off, Bowser's\nCastle plunged straight into\nthe Shangri-Spa campus.
W5G1_101	Yeah! Right into our banquet hall!
W5G1_105	One must make a reservation to\ndrop a castle on our banquet hall.\nDo you have any idea how far out\nwe're booked?!
W5G1_109	I have no choice but to charge a\nlate fee, an early fee, an on-time\nfee, a cancellation fee, and an\nappearance fee!
W5G1_107	How will you be paying today, blue-\nrobed wizard? Coins, credit, or the\nblood, sweat, and tears of Bowser's\nmany minions?\x0e\0\x04\0...Excuse me? Robed wizard? Hey!\nI know you can hear me over there.\x0e\0\x04\0Ugh. Never mind. Your fellow minions\nare already hard at work, so I'll just\ntack on an additional silence fee\nand leave you to it. Good luck.
W5G1_26	...Well, you heard the Toad.\nThis is the state of Lord Bowser's\nminions, castle, and life.
W5G1_22	Ah, so that scary-looking face is\njust a part of Bowser's Castle.\x0e\0\x04\0And we need to go...inside the\nface to reach the green streamer.
W5G1_24	You intend to enter Bowser's Castle?\nVery well, perhaps I can be of some\nassistance.\x0e\0\x04\0Follow me. Quickly now!
W5G1_27	This way, Mario! There's no time\nfor side quests!
W5G1_215	You're not gonna follow him to\nBowser's Castle? He's a top\ngroundskeeper!

W5G1_158	What are you worried about?\nIt's a perfectly standard mouth-\ndoor!
W5G1_29	Well, that confirms it. There really\nis a lightning beast guarding the\nfront door. I'm relieved it wasn't\njust my imagination.
W5G1_30	I suppose we don't have much\nchance against it from down here.\x0e\0\x04\0And those Folded Soldiers\nconfiscated my flying broomstick.
W5G1_32	How will we get up there?\nTHINK, Kamek...

W5G1_255	Oh! It's the Young Master,\nBowser Jr.!\x0e\0\x04\0I've never been so happy to see\nLord Bowser's devilish spawn come\nflying recklessly out of nowhere in\nhis clown car.\x0e\0\x04\0Because we might be able to use\nthat very clown car to reach the\ncloud, you see?
W5G1_34	\x0e\x02\0\0{s[150]}NOOOOO!{s[100]}\x0f\x02\0
W5G1_37	Young Master! Your body! Your\nclown car!
W5G1_38	Oh, I can't understand what he's\ntrying to say. Young Master, if it's\nabout your current state, I assure\nyou that we are aware of it!\x0e\0\x04\0Unfortunately neither he nor his\nclown car are in a condition to\nhelp us anymore...
W5G1_233	Excuse me, Kamek! I know it seems\noff topic, but have you been into\nany of the hot springs yet?\x0e\0\x04\0They're pretty rejuvenating! Maybe\na soak would even help the Young\nMaster here...
W5G1_234	By Jove, you're right!\x0e\0\x04\0Those obsequious Toads in the lobby\nhanded me a pamphlet about the\nrestorative powers of the Spring of\nPurification. It's near the entrance!
W5G1_142	Quickly! Let's get Young Master's\nshredded body into the Spring of\nPurification before the damage\nis irreversible!\x0e\0\x04\0If my calculations are correct, he\nwill be flying and wreaking havoc\nagain in no time.
W5G1_39	What are you doing? We must hurry\nto the Spring of Purification!
W5G1_240	No! Don't tell me someone else\nhas reserved the spring!
W5G1_241	Excuse me! Would you mind terribly\nif we hopped in with our shredded\nfriend here?\x0e\0\x04\0Or...are you guys also shredded\nand trying to heal?

W5G1_238	Now, now, Young Master.\nBe sure to soak your entire body.
W5G1_231	Well? Is it working?
W5G1_374	Aha! He's whole again! Perhaps\nI should rescind my one-star online\nreview of Shangri-Spa...
W5G1_195	It wasn't me! I didn't crash\nthe castle this time!\x0e\0\x04\0I just came here to help Dad, but\nthe next thing I knew I was all cut\nup into pieces.
W5G1_197	And what's he doing here? Are we\nabout to fight? Because I'm always\nready. Let's go!

W5G1_198	Wait, Young Master. We have more\nimportant things to do than battle\nMario for the millionth time.\x0e\0\x04\0If you want to help your dad, you\ncould help us enter his castle! We\nrequire the use of your clown car.
W5G1_343	Do we get to fight someone?\x0e\0\x04\0I haven't fought anyone in over\nan hour! Let's hurry up and do this!
W5G1_344	Aw, man! This dumb thing's busted.
W5G1_345	Hmm... So even though you're \nback in one piece, you're still\ntoo creased to fly...\x0e\0\x04\0You're also wrinkled and filthy!\nI hate to think what Lord Bowser\nwould say if he saw you in such\na state.\x0e\0\x04\0Indeed, it seems flying is still out of\nthe question. Blast!
W5G1_204	Guys...the wrinkles...and the dirt...\nand the creases...\x0e\0\x04\0Just soak it all away in the\nhot springs, okaaaay?\x0e\0\x04\0Then we can get all of the\nstamps and the free priiiiize...
W5G1_206	Hmm...that gives me an idea.\nThere are more of these springs\naround Shangri-Spa, right? And each\nhas unique rejuvenative properties?\x0e\0\x04\0The answer is clear—we must visit\nthem all! Young Master...roll yourself\nand get on my back.

W5G1_153	That is a big improvement! I was\nskeptical, \x0e\x01\x01\0but this hot spring really\ndoes a number on folds.
W5G1_220	Kaa! Mario, look at Olivia!\x0e\0\x04\0We need to get her out of\nthis hot spring immediately!
W5G1_221	Her folds are starting to disappear!\nShe'll be regular paper in no time if\nwe fail to take action!

W5G1_391	I'm tired of all of these baths!\nDad has NEVER taken a bath,\nand he's doing just fine.\x0e\0\x04\0Gah! Just hurry up and get me\nto the next one so I can get\nback to the action!

W5G1_384	Now I'm all good, right?
W5G1_370	Um...not quite. You're still as\nwhite as a sheet.\x0e\0\x04\0...Oh, I forgot that your sheets are\nblack and have Bowser's face\nprinted on them...\x0e\0\x04\0The point is, we're not quite\nthere yet with your recovery,\nYoung Master.
W5G1_371	Well, since we went to all of the hot\nsprings...isn't there supposed to be\na prize for that?\x0e\0\x04\0Other than radiant skin and a total\nZen-like calm in your soul? Let's get\nthat last stamp and find out!
W5G1_372	Well, since we've been to all of the\nhot springs now...\x0e\0\x04\0Should we get that last stamp\nand go see what the prize is?
W5G1_388	Yeah! They definitely owe me\na prize for having to take all\nof these baths.
W5G1_389	*sigh* I suppose you're right.\x0e\0\x04\0I don't know what the prize will be,\nand I can't imagine it will be useful...\x0e\0\x04\0But I suppose it wouldn't hurt to\ngo claim it at the front desk. I can\nalso lodge a formal complaint while\nwe're there...
W5G1_376	This is the stamp booth for our\nsuccessive-soaker campaign.\x0e\0\x04\0Collect one from each of our hot\nsprings and you'll get a prize.
W5G1_381	That's the stamp booth for our\nsuccessive-soaker campaign.\x0e\0\x04\0Collect one from each of our hot\nsprings and you'll get a prize.
W5G1_377	Thanks for using the hot spring.\nDon't forget to stamp your card!
W5G1_378	Sir! Don't forget your stamp!
W5G1_379	Sorry, you can't double-stamp.\nYou've already got this one.

W5G1_262	I got it, I got it. Get in, guys!

W5G1_402	This is embarrassing.\x0e\x01\0\x04\xc4\t\0\0

W5G1_411	The jungle looks super dangerous...and so fun!\x0e\x01\0\x04\xc4\t\0\0
W5G1_426	Young Master! I suggest a more prudent mindset!\x0e\x01\0\x04\xc4\t\0\0
W5G1_412	It's only 10,000 coins! What are you, cheap?\x0e\x01\0\x04\xc4\t\0\0
W5G1_427	Perhaps Mario is saving up...\x0e\x01\0\x04\xc4\t\0\0

W5G1_108	They've got us sweepin' the grass.\nNot even Bowser makes us do that!
W5G1_161	(Thanks for helping with that.\nBeen trying to trim those leaves\nfrom the inside for hours.)
W5G1_148	One day you're leading an elite\ndivision of Shy Guys...the next\nyou're scrubbin' the floor. Ugh...
W5G1_362	Shh! This tree is already pretty\nclean, but I've got a good thing\ngoin' here.
W5G1_205	Welcome, welcome! I hope\nyou're having a pleasant\nstay at Shangri-Spa!
W5G1_151	I joined Bowser's army so I wouldn't\nhave to get a real job...
W5G1_152	I can't talk now! That Toad yells\nevery time my productivity drops!
W5G1_361	The grooves in these columns are\nlike a spa...for mold!
W5G1_350	It ain't just a throwin' hammer, see?
W5G1_127	My section is cleaner.
W5G1_141	No, mine is cleaner.
W5G1_199	Some of our VIP guests have\nreserved these chairs. You'll\nhave to wait your turn.
W5G1_293	Oh, it seems they've departed\nahead of schedule. Please feel\nfree to submit a request for\na reservation.
W5G1_356	We conscripted Snifits to run these\nshops, and they simply disappeared!
W5G1_355	Sure, they're back at work now\nthat I'm watching. They're still\ngetting a write-up!
W5G1_181	Why me...
W5G1_354	Gah! I was, uh...cleaning the inside\nof that crate. Guess it doesn't need\ncleaning anymore. So...thanks?
W5G1_359	They asked me what job I wanted,\nand I said I was on the fence...\nWho takes idioms literally?!
W5G1_351	Want to make sure you don't miss\nany springs? You can check the\nlocations of all our springs on this\nhandy map!
W5G1_360	I actually like this janitorial work\nmore than regular minion work.\nI'm kind of a neat freak.
W5G1_363	Less talkin', more cleanin'!\nMy arms aren't gettin' tired...\nbut I'm gettin' SUPER bored.\x0e\x01\x01\0
W5G1_367	(Dude. Why?)
W5G1_31	Careful. I hear a lot more screaming\nthan you'd expect at a hot spring.
W5G1_68	Did you fix it? I still hear screaming,\nbut I'm pretty sure it's just in my\nown head.
W5G1_352	Careful...careful...
W5G1_357	No! I had them all stacked!
W5G1_358	I cleaned the roof and then\nI cleaned the coins. What's\nnext, boss?
W5G1_83	Hey! Mario! The Shangri-Spa staff\nare actually serious about making\nus minions work off our debt.\x0e\0\x04\0We're selling a one-of-a-kind item\nfor just 10,000 coins. Will you buy\nit and help our cause?\x0e\x01\x04\x1c\x12\0y\0e\0s\0n\0o\0_\0b\0u\0y\0\x01\0\0\0\0\0\0\0
W5G1_284	No? Ahh, man. It's just...I thought\nMario was collecting these things,\nyou know? So I thought it was a\ngood deal at this limited-time price...\x0e\0\x04\0And this kind of manual labor\nisn't really in our job descriptions.\nI'm sick of it!\x0e\0\x04\0Yeah, I know technically we're\nsupposed to be able to lift 50\npounds above our heads...
W5G1_175	Whoa! I wasn't expecting to make\nthe sale without even saying what\nI was selling. You're generous!
W5G1_93	Aw, man! You don't have\nenough coins.
W5G1_156	Mario, surely you've heard of\nour terrible plight. \x0e\0\x04\0Someone crashed the castle\ninto the spa, and we have to\npay for the damages!\x0e\0\x04\0It would really help us out if you\nwould purchase a mystery item from\nme for 10...no, 20,000 coins.\x0e\x01\x04\x1c\x12\0y\0e\0s\0n\0o\0_\0b\0u\0y\0\x01\0\0\0\0\0\0\0
W5G1_286	No? Seriously?\x0e\0\x04\0Hmph. And I heard you were\na serious collector...
W5G1_176	I'm so sick of sweepin'! I wanna get\nback to my regular job of rakin'!\x0e\0\x04\0You wanna buy somethin' for\n10,000 coins? All proceeds go to\ngettin' a rake back in my hands.\x0e\x01\x04\x1c\x12\0y\0e\0s\0n\0o\0_\0b\0u\0y\0\x01\0\0\0\0\0\0\0
W5G1_285	Aw, man! Now you'll never know\nwhat you're missin' out on, and\nI'll never stop sweepin'!
W5G1_178	Wow. I can't believe it. This is gonna\nhelp us minions pay off our debt,\nbig-time. You really are a hero!
W5G1_180	Oh, man! You don't even have\nenough coins.
W5G1_162	I'm so sick of sweepin'! I wanna get\nback to my— Wait a second...\x0e\0\x04\0I've already given you the sales\npitch, right? Well, the price went\nup! It's 20,000 coins now.\x0e\0\x04\0So you want it or what?\x0e\x01\x04\x1c\x12\0y\0e\0s\0n\0o\0_\0b\0u\0y\0\x01\0\0\0\0\0\0\0
W5G1_287	Bah! You're still not gonna complete\nthe collection?! With all those coins\nyou musta found in the castle?
W5G1_84	I'm not shirking! I just...uh...slipped.\nYeah. That'll play.
W5G1_88	Hey, I was just on one of my two\nlegally mandated 15-minute breaks!
W5G1_85	Hmm? Oh, I'm not stranded here.\nI was just taking it all in...
W5G1_89	Finally...I'm saved...

W5G1_270	Erm... Do you have somewhere else\nto be right now? I suppose you may.\nVery well! I shall await your return\nwith the Young Master.
W5G1_279	Ah, welcome back. Shall we?
W5G1_269	Hey! We need to hurry up and\nsave my dad! So I'm gonna wait\nfor you, but I'm not gonna be\nhappy about it...
W5G1_271	What took you so long?! C'mon!
W5G1_385	Wait...now WE have to work?\nWhy did we just let them leave?!
W5G1_386	Not to worry. We'll recoup the\nlost fees by doubling the rate\nat their next visit.
W5G1_387	I must admit, the speech by that\ngroundskeeper was stirring...
W5G1_392	Did we all learn a lesson? I know\nI learned a lot about sweeping\nand mopping.
W5G1_393	I trust you enjoyed our hot springs?\nPlease come again, Mario!

W6C1_18	Well, after all that, another crash\nlanding. I mean...our first crash\nlanding! ...Is Bowser not even here?
W6C1_19	Aww, man! Dad's not gonna be\nhappy about the airship. His\ninsurance premiums are already so\nhigh! And where are we, anyway?
W6C1_20	We were so close to Peach's Castle...\nWe must still be nearby!

W6C1_2	It's me!
W6C1_3	Never mind the airship. You know\nI'll build another one!\x0e\0\x04\0Just get up here! I've got something\nto show you.
W6C1_21	Dad! You're OK! I was worried you\ngot folded up even smaller or\nsomething. We'll be right there!

W6C1_40	Yowch! It's REALLY hot by the\nedge here, Mario. I'm worried that\nit would be the end for you if you\nfell in there...
W6C1_42	You can't survive falling into lava,\ncan you? Can you?! I don't want\nto find out, so please be careful!

W6C2_12	Bwahaha! See? How do I never\nget credit for having great ideas?!
W6C2_13	Well, I think you're amazing, Bowser.\nI'm very impressed with how you got\nso many minions to follow you even\nthough you're just a scary face!
W6C2_16	Whew...time for a deep breath.\nWe've got to stop my brother and\nsave Princess Peach!
W6C2_14	Oh, come on! Seriously?!
W6C2_43	What?! It's locked?! We need the\nkey to Peach's Castle!
W6C2_46	Huh?! Why does that sound so\nfamiliar to me?

W6C2_3	Big news, Bro! You know the key I've\nbeen looking for?
W6C2_15	I couldn't find it.
W6C2_28	I've been looking everywhere, but\nI just can't find it. I'm-a sorry for\nletting you down, Bro.\x0e\0\x04\0It's got to be somewhere...\ndoesn't it?
W6C2_98	Aww, don't worry about it, Luigi.\nYou tried really hard, and that's\nwhat counts sometimes.
W6C2_36	You did your best, Luigi...
W6C2_39	The one key I couldn't find...
W6C2_99	Bah! This is Luigi we're talking\nabout, right? The key's probably\nright around here somewhere, and\nhe doesn't even know it!
W6C2_109	We need to find the key and get\ninto the castle! What can we do?
W6C2_134	I'm-a sorry, Bro.
W6C2_4	Bwahaha! No wonder your kart\nis so slow. How long has that\nthing been stuck in the pipe?!
W6C2_110	Mamma mia! It's been there the\nwhole time? So all this searching\nI've been doing was for nothing...
W6C2_5	Well, you had a way of finding\nOTHER keys that we needed,\nright when we needed them.\nThat was helpful!\x0e\0\x04\0And now you've brought us the\nright key at the right time. Way\nto go, Luigi!
W6C2_106	Really? Well, it's no big deal.\nI guess I just got lucky...
W6C2_111	Bahaha! You heard him. It was luck!\nSo let's cut the pity party and bust\ninto that castle already!
W6C2_122	Not this again...
W6C2_123	Unfold...unfold...UNFOLD! BAH!
W6C2_7	\x0e\x01\x03\x04\x02\0\0\0You're finally here, Mario.\nI'm so happy. So... Happy...
W6C2_8	Princess! I'm-a coming!
W6C2_9	\x0e\x01\x03\x04\x02\0\0\0Follow me...
W6C2_44	Won't open, huh? I bet they didn't\neven put anything on the other side.\nBah! Patch in the rest of the castle,\nyou cowards!
W6C2_10	\x0e\x01\x03\x04\x02\0\0\0You are the blessed few to have\nbeen invited by King Olly himself.\x0e\0\x04\0\x0e\x01\x03\x04\x02\0\0\0Come along, and witness!
W6C2_40	\x0e\x02\0\0{s[150]}An origami castle?!{s[100]}\x0f\x02\0
W6C2_37	I can't believe it. He folded up\nPeach's Castle into his own\norigami castle!\x0e\0\x04\0I guess he really is serious about\nturning everything in the world\ninto origami...
W6C2_38	So it's all folded up now. Big deal!\nIt's still Peach's Castle, right?\x0e\0\x04\0Your brother and Princess Peach\nare both still in there, so let's go\nget 'em!
W6C2_121	I have a feeling that it's going to be\npretty dangerous up ahead, Mario.\nMaybe you should save first...
W6C2_29	\x0e\x03\x02\0It's Mario! Alert King Olly!\x0f\x03\x02
W6C2_32	I ordered you to stop Mario and\nhis friends, and you've failed.\x0e\0\x04\0You pathetic cowards!
W6C2_78	\x0e\x03\x02\0I was going to retire tomorrow...\x0f\x03\x02
W6C2_113	\x0e\x03\x02\0Recycle me...\x0f\x03\x02
W6C2_114	I suppose this is fitting.\nWelcome to Origami Castle, Mario.
W6C2_112	Hold on, Brother!\x0e\0\x04\0Folding Peach's Castle into this\norigami castle is too far. There's\nno coming back from that!\x0e\0\x04\0If you do anything worse, I...I...
W6C2_33	Oh, my dear Olivia... If only you\nshared my wisdom. If only you\nshared my VISION for an origami\nkingdom...\x0e\0\x04\0I assure you...folding all of Peach's\nCastle into origami is just the\nbeginning...
W6C2_34	Mario, since I know best, I have\nrefolded this castle in my image.\nI sincerely hope you enjoy it.
W6C2_77	How do you like Origami Castle\nso far? Too easy?\x0e\0\x04\0Say no more. I hear your feedback\nloud and clear and will be happy\nto implement changes immediately!
W6C2_83	Whaaat?! Did they just steal\nthat Magic Circle?
W6C2_85	\x0e\x03\x02\0It's Mario! Get him, everybody!\x0f\x03\x02
W6C2_18	You're not giving up, huh?\nGuess you really like those\nflat losers. Pathetic.\x0e\0\x04\0Anyway, it doesn't matter.\nMy vision of a perfect origami\nkingdom is almost realized...
W6C2_17	Huh?! You're still working on some\nevil plan?\x0e\0\x04\0Why won't you just give up?!
W6C2_19	How dare you criticize me!\nIf it weren't for me, you wouldn't\neven be here.\x0e\0\x04\0Whatever. I'm tired of trying to\nexplain myself to fools. You leave\nme with no choice.
W6C2_25	Bind them.
W6C2_26	Hey! That's the thing! That's the\nthing that turned me into...this!\x0e\0\x04\0Mario...you GOTTA win this one!
W6C2_20	Ahhh...something came loose...
W6C2_21	Ooh! This could be our chance to\nfix poor Bowser!
W6C2_22	C'mon, Mario! Use your hammer and\nflatten me out. I let you fire my\ncannon, remember? You owe me!
W6C2_23	YES! I'M BACK! We never speak of\nthis again. Got it?!
W6C2_89	Wow! So that's what you actually\nlook like? You're so big and strong!\x0e\0\x04\0...And kinda scary too...
W6C2_96	BWAHAHA! That's right! Now, let's\nfind that twerp brother of yours\nand see what HE thinks of me in\nall my glory.\x0e\0\x04\0...I also wouldn't mind showing\nPrincess Peach that I'm not a\nsandwich board anymore.
W6C2_35	Where are you going?! I'm not\ngoing anywhere until I get my\nrevenge. I'll wait here!
W6C2_76	All right, let's go!\x0e\x01\0\x04\xc4\t\0\0
W6C2_104	All right! If I know evil lairs—and\nI think I do—this should be the top\nfloor. That's where the throne room\nusually is.\x0e\0\x04\0Your brother must be on the\nother side of that door. So let's\ngo get him!
W6C2_107	I...I'm scared.\x0e\0\x04\0I can't believe my own brother\nwould set that vicious Stapler\non me.\x0e\0\x04\0Can we even stop him now?\nOr is he already too powerful...
W6C2_118	Thank you, Mario. You're always\nthere for me when I'm at my\nabsolute flimsiest...
W6C2_127	This has just been such a long\nand difficult journey...\x0e\0\x04\0But I've had so much help along the\nway! I'm so grateful for you and\nLuigi, Kamek, the Bowsers...\x0e\0\x04\0and Bobby, of course...\x0e\0\x04\0{s[075]}Oh, and the professor, Captain T. Ode,\nOl' Grandsappy, the Shangri-Spa Toads,\nthe sea captain, the oarsman, and the\nOrigami Craftsman...{s[100]}
W6C2_128	You've all been so amazing\nand helpful...\x0e\0\x04\0And now I just feel bad that\nI'm putting you all in danger\nyet again...
W6C2_108	Hey, origami girl! Look at me. I'm\nBowser! I breathe fire and punch\nthrough solid rock sometimes! You\nthink I'm scared of that little twerp?\x0e\0\x04\0Plus, I mean...I'm raising Junior. You\nthink that's easy? Try parenting a\n"high-energy" kid with access to\na flying car and his own army!\x0e\0\x04\0Your brother doesn't scare me.
W6C2_116	Wow. That really puts it\nin perspective.
W6C2_117	You know what? I'm feeling better!\nHow about you, Mario? Are you\nready to do this?
W6C2_119	All riiiight! I feel like I'll be ready\nto do my part when the time comes.\x0e\0\x04\0I just have to do my best and\ncount on all of you—my friends!
W6C2_105	Well, you're finally here.\nTook you long enough.\x0e\0\x04\0As a matter of fact, it took you\nso long that there's nothing\nyou can do to stop me now.
W6C2_129	Brother! Are you still planning\nmore terrible things?!
W6C2_132	Yeah! Who do you think you are,\nfolding up me and my minions like\nthat? Like you could keep all THIS\nfrom bustin' loose!\x0e\0\x04\0Anyway, where's Princess Peach?\nIs she safe? Is she comfortable?\nDoes she have something to read?\n...Asking for a friend.
W6C2_130	Oh, the princess is right in\nfront of you. Behold!
W6C2_86	I told you, didn't I? That I would\ntransform all of Peach's Castle\ninto an origami castle. Including\nthe princess herself.\x0e\0\x04\0She is at one with the castle now.\nBeautiful, precious, and silent.\nI'm sure she's happier this way.
W6C2_47	You monster! Folding Princess Peach\ninto the castle is too much. You've\ngone too far!\x0e\0\x04\0You couldn't possibly do anything\nworse! Except... Wait... *gasp*
W6C2_87	All those paper cranes...\nYou wouldn't...
W6C2_48	I would. And I did.\x0e\0\x04\0Witness the Thousand Cranes\ntechnique! He who has the patience\nto fold 1,000 origami cranes shall\nhave any wish granted.\x0e\0\x04\0That is real, ultimate power, and I\nshall use it to turn every last one\nof those wretched Toads into mere\nblank paper.
W6C2_49	What?! That's crazy talk. The\nToads can't come back from\nthat, you know.\x0e\0\x04\0I wouldn't even do that. And I've\ndone some mean stuff, believe me!\nAsk Kamek!
W6C2_50	I still don't understand what\nyou've got against the Toads.\x0e\0\x04\0Do you realize that even YOU\nwere originally folded by a Toad?
W6C2_51	Of course I do! He's the whole\nreason I'm doing this!\x0e\0\x04\0That fool disrespected the very\npaper I am made of...\x0e\x01\0\x04\xf4\x01\0\0\x0e\x01\x01\0 He scribbled\nall over it!\x0e\0\x04\0Now I bear the hideous scar of\nhis negligence and disregard for\norigami... And he shall pay!
W6C2_52	THAT'S why you're doing this?
W6C2_54	But even if you're mad at him,\nwhy take it out on all of the\nother Toads?
W6C2_53	If you've seen one Toad, you've\nseen them all! They're all the\nsame to me!\x0e\0\x04\0That's why I have to turn them all\ninto blank pieces of scrap paper.\nSo I never have to see a single one\nof their stupid faces again!\x0e\0\x04\0That...is my vision for a glorious\norigami kingdom.
W6C2_115	As for you, Mario. You've proven\nto be quite annoying.\x0e\0\x04\0But there's nothing you can do\nnow to stop me. Already, 999 of\nmy cranes are complete...
W6C2_120	After I defeat you...\x0e\x01\x01\0I'll honor your\npaper by folding you into the very\nlast crane!
W6C2_126	No, Olivia...\x0e\0\x04\0That hammer attack was divine.\nYou put everything into it...and\nit was enough to awaken me from\nthis dark dream.\x0e\0\x04\0I was too proud, too entitled...\nMy heart was blintzed, my path\nwas creased... I was a mess.
W6C2_57	I'm sorry, Brother. I had no choice...\x0e\0\x04\0Oh, but your poor body is all\ncrumpled now. Maybe I went\ntoo far...
W6C2_58	Wait...what's this? On your belly?
W6C2_59	Oh...*cough*! It hurts to move, but...\nThat is the cause of all of this\nmadness. The careless scrawl\nthat Toad marked me with...\x0e\0\x04\0Read it for me, will you? I must know\nwhat is written there... What words\nor gibberish mark this foolish body?\nPlease...I could use one last laugh.
W6C2_88	OK. Um, let's see...
W6C2_60	\x0e\x01\x03\x04\0\0\0\0\x0e\x02\0\0{s[100]}{c[7a44a9]}Dearest Olly, may you grow{c[404040]}{s[100]}\x0f\x02\0\n\x0e\x02\0\0{s[100]}{c[7a44a9]}into a fair and kind king.{c[404040]}{s[100]}\x0f\x02\0\x0e\x01\0\x04\xb8\x0b\0\0
W6C2_61	...It's not just a scribble.\x0e\0\x04\0It's a very sweet message from the\nOrigami Craftsman. He just wished\nyou the best as a new king...
W6C2_62	Ha. HA.\x0e\0\x04\0AHAHAH!\x0e\0\x04\0Oh, I've been a terrible king.\nTo think, this is how I repaid\nhis kindness.
W6C2_131	I just became so blinded by rage.\nI did so many unforgivable things...\x0e\0\x04\0I'm so sorry that Princess Peach\nand Mario became caught up in\nall this.
W6C2_124	Olivia...there's something you must\ndo for me.\x0e\0\x04\0Please accept these 999 cranes.\nAnd then fold my body into the\n1,000th.
W6C2_125	When the last fold is complete,\nyou will gain the ability to have\nany wish granted.\x0e\0\x04\0I don't suppose it'll make up for\neverything I've done, but it's\nall I have left.
W6C2_133	I'm begging you, Olivia.\nDo this for me.
W6C2_64	\x0e\x02\0\0{s[150]}BROTHER!{s[100]}\x0f\x02\0
W6C2_65	Mario...I have something\nto confess...
W6C2_84	I don't know how to fold a crane!\x0e\0\x04\0Maybe Olly could have taught\nme—after all, he folded the whole\ncastle and even ME—but look\nat him now...
W6C2_66	Hey, guys! I hope I didn't miss\ntoo much. I found the Origami\nCraftsman!\x0e\0\x04\0Maybe he can talk Olly out of all\nthis nonsense, right? Because he's\nthe one who originally folded him!
W6C2_82	Ah yes... I remember this paper\nwell. Such a lovely royal purple...\x0e\0\x04\0And Olivia! So good to see you\nmaking use of the giant-hammer\ntechnique I folded into your design.
W6C2_67	Wait! There are an awful lot\nof cranes here. Is one of you\nattempting the forbidden 1,000-\ncrane technique?!
W6C2_68	Yes, but...I promise I won't use\nit for evil! Can you teach me\nhow to fold the last crane?\x0e\0\x04\0I want to fulfill my brother's final\nwish and complete the thousandth\ncrane myself.
W6C2_69	Very well, I will teach you. I suppose\nall of this trouble is my fault, in a\nway. After all, I was the one who\noriginally folded your brother.\x0e\0\x04\0This will be my last Fold of Life,\nthen. Olivia...prepare to fold as\nyou have never folded before!
W6C2_70	Well done. With that, the technique\nis complete.\x0e\0\x04\0You may make your wish, Olivia.
W6C2_71	OK. My wish...my wish...
W6C2_79	Thousandth crane, grant\nme my wish...
W6C2_90	May all of the origami folded by\nmy brother be undone!
W6C2_72	Where are you going, Bro?\nI'll just wait here...
W6C2_73	You're back! Let's-a go.
W6C2_74	Bah! Pipes are your thing. I'll be here\nwhen you get back.
W6C2_75	Finally. C'mon, let's do this!
W6C2_80	Has there always been a pipe here?\nI wonder if it's connected somewhere\noutside...
W7C1.msbt
W7C1_106	GAH! Phew! Thank you so much,\nMario... I thought I'd be jammed\nin there forever!\x0e\0\x04\0This is one of the Sensor Lab's\nsatellite offices, located right here\nin \x0e\x03\0\x04\0\0\0\0.
W7C1_107	We develop advanced sensory tech\nto help adventurers like you! I can't\noffer you anything myself, but...\x0e\0\x04\0I'm sure the head researcher has\nsomething useful! You should pay\nhim a visit!
W7C1_120	Getting to the main Sensor Lab\nis a total breeze. Let me show you\nsome truly cutting-edge tech...
W7C1_108	We've developed this "fax travel"\nsystem to help folks zip between\nour many office locations.\x0e\0\x04\0It'll let you zap from this satellite\noffice to our main Sensor Lab in an\ninstant! Give it a try!
W7C1_49	What do you say, Mario? Want to\n"fax travel" to our main Sensor Lab\nlocation?\x0e\x01\x04\x14\n\0y\0e\0s\0n\0o\0\x01\0\0\0\0\0\0\0

W7C1_85	Sensational! You found me, Mario!\nThis is perfect! I've finally found a\nsuitable tester...\x0e\0\x04\0See, I'm the head researcher here\nat the Sensor Lab.\x0e\0\x04\0We develop technology capable of\ndetecting all kinds of things that\nare otherwise difficult to see.\x0e\0\x04\0Sensor tech is changing the world!\nWe're breaking conventions and\nshifting all manner of paradigms!
W7C1_86	Because you've shown an aptitude\nfor Toad detection, I shall let you\ntest our new creation...Toad Radar!\x0e\0\x04\0With this little beauty, you can suss\nout hidden Toads without suffering\neven a single crease in your brow!
W7C1_113	Sensational. I've truly outdone\nmyself this time...\x0e\0\x04\0Ah! Mario! Join me in a little\nthought experiment, won't you?\x0e\0\x04\0What if, rather than detect unseen\nobjects...we were to create a device\nthat makes YOU undetectable?\x0e\0\x04\0You needn't wonder! Feast your\neyes, while you can, upon...the\nLamination Suit!\x0e\0\x04\0Wearing this will make it easier for\nyou to sneak by enemies! BOOM!\nAnother paradigm shifted!
W7C1_115	At long last...my opus is complete.\nMy work has reached its zenith.\x0e\0\x04\0My Hidden Block Unhider will turn\nnearby hidden blocks into regular,\nunhidden blocks!\x0e\0\x04\0We've taken this paradigm and\nHURLED it into the lake of progress!\nBEGONE, PARADIGM!
W7C1_89	Hop down that pipe and I'll give you\na quick primer on how to work the\n\x0e\x03\0\x04\0\0\0\0.
W7C1_97	I must say, that went exceedingly\nwell. The Toad Radar didn't even\nexplode this time! How lucky!\x0e\0\x04\0All that remains before certification\nis a robust field test.\x0e\0\x04\0Go out into the world, Mario!\nUse the Toad Radar to rescue\nsome hapless, folded Toads!
W7C1_98	Yet another explosion-free test!\nThis may be our longest streak ever!\x0e\0\x04\0We're free to advance to the\nfield test for this item as well.\x0e\0\x04\0As I mentioned in the test, more-\npowerful foes may still sense your\npresence. Be careful out there!
W7C1_99	We have shifted every existing\nparadigm. A new era of superior\nsensory apparatus is dawning.\x0e\0\x04\0You know what to do, Mario. Take\nthis Hidden Block Unhider with you!\nFind every ? Block out there!\x0e\0\x04\0Most importantly, if it explodes...\ndo NOT tell anyone. I've already\nsent some rather boastful faxes.
W7C1_100	When the battery runs out, you can\nuse our proprietary device charger\nto juice it back up! However...\x0e\0\x04\0Its use requires a MODEST donation.\nPower isn't cheap, and funding is\nhard to come by...
W7C1_6	My work here is incomplete. There\nare paradigms yet unshifted, so...\nback to it!
W7C1_88	My work is finally complete.\nSo...now what?\x0e\0\x04\0I guess I could...find a new hobby?\nMaybe I'll learn how to fold origami...

W7C1_25	*ahem* Testing! One-two! One-two!\nCan you hear me, Mario?\x0e\0\x04\0Let me walk you through a quick\ntest of the Toad Radar.
W7C1_26	Can you feel the device on your\nhead? As you may have guessed,\nthat's the Toad Radar!
W7C1_27	The dish will scan the area and\nreact to any hidden Toads you\nmay be facing.
W7C1_28	The closer you are to a potential\nToad, the stronger the Toad Radar\nwill react.\x0e\0\x04\0When you think you've found one,\ntry whacking nearby objects with\nyour hammer to unfold the Toad!
W7C1_29	This advanced level of detection\nuses a MASSIVE amount of power,\nso the battery will drain quite fast.\x0e\0\x04\0No power, no Toad Radar. Got it?\nKeep an eye on your battery!
W7C1_30	OK! That's enough explanation.\nLet's run some actual tests!

W7C1_3	Amazing! It works! Thanks to you,\nour test was a total success.
W7C1_4	Oh. Oh dear. You ran out of power.
W7C1_henkou_tutorial_01	OK, Mario. Let's have you try the\nLamination Suit on for size.
W7C1_henkou_tutorial_02	Do you see? Or rather, do you NOT?\nThe suit turned you transparent!\x0e\0\x04\0Now you'll be able to sneak by\nyour enemies undetected. It's a\nclear path to victory!
W7C1_henkou_tutorial_04	Be careful not to bump or brush\nagainst any foes. That would\nreveal your position!\x0e\0\x04\0Enemies with sharpened senses will\nsee right through this trick...rather\nthan seeing right through you. Ha!
W7C1_henkou_tutorial_05	Just like the Toad Radar, the suit's\nbattery will drain rather quickly.\nKeep an eye on your power!

W7C1_henkou_tutorial_07	You made it through all of the tests!\nNice work, Mario!
W7C1_henkou_tutorial_08	Ah! The Lamination Suit makes\nyou invisible to Folded Soldiers, but\ntouching them will give you away!
W7C1_henkou_tutorial_09	Oh. Oh dear. You ran out of power.
W7C1_kakushi_tutorial_01	Are you ready to learn the secrets\nof the Hidden Block Unhider, Mario?
W7C1_kakushi_tutorial_02	The device on your head looks\nfamiliar, doesn't it?\x0e\0\x04\0The Hidden Block Unhider shares\nits design with the Toad Radar...\nand it's similar to operate!
W7C1_kakushi_tutorial_03	The device will alert you if and when\nyou're facing a hidden block...
W7C1_kakushi_tutorial_04	As you get closer, it will give you\nstronger and stronger reactions.\x0e\0\x04\0Try jumping right there, Mario.
W7C1_kakushi_tutorial_05	Aha! A hidden block has appeared!\nWelcome to the visible world, you\nslippery cube, you!\x0e\0\x04\0When you know you're close,\na simple jump or swing of your\nhammer should do the trick.
W7C1_kakushi_tutorial_06	Like our other devices, the battery\nis going to run out sooner or later.\nJust keep an eye on the meter!
W7C1_kakushi_tutorial_07	OK! Let's hunt for some blocks!
W7C1_kakushi_tutorial_11	\x0e\x02\0\0Find the hidden blocks before\x0f\x02\0\n\x0e\x02\0\0the battery runs out!\x0f\x02\0

W7C2_A_3	I know a Shy Guy who knows a\nShy Guy who can wail on guitar...\nGoombas can't even HOLD one.
